1_2014,2014,CLICIT201411.pdf,"Azad Abad, Alessandro Moschitti",Creating a standard for evaluating Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction,ENG,2,0,0,"Università di Trento, Qatar Computing Research Institute",2,1,0,1,Alessandro Moschitti,0,0,"Italy, Qatar","Trento, Rome, Ar-Rayyan","This paper defines a standard for comparing relation extraction (RE) systems based on a Distant Supervision (DS). We integrate the well-known New York Time corpus with the more recent version of Freebase. Then, we define a simpler RE system based on DS, which exploits SVMs, tree kernels and a simple one-vs-all strategy. The resulting model can be used as a baseline for system comparison. We also study several example filtering techniques for improving the quality of the DS output.","Currently, supervised learning approaches are widely used to train relation extractors. However, manually providing large-scale human-labeled training data is costly in terms of resources and time. Besides, (i) a small-size corpus can only contains few relation types and (ii) the resulting trained model is domain-dependent. Distance Supervision (DS) is an alternative approach to overcome the problem of data annotation (Craven et al., 1999) as it can automatically generate training data by combining (i) a structured Knowledge Base (KB), e.g., Freebase1 with a large-scale unlabeled corpus, C. The basic idea is: given a tuple r<e1,e2> contained in a referring KB, if both e1 and e2 appear in a sentence of C, that sentence is assumed to express the relation type r, i.e., it is considered a training sentence for r. For example, given the KB relation, president(Obama,USA), the following sentence, Obama has been elected in the USA presidential campaign, can be used as a positive training example for president(x,y). However, DS suffers from two major drawbacks: first, in early studies, Mintz et al. (2009) assumed that two entity mentions cannot be in a relation with different relation types r1 and r2. In contrast, Hoffmann et al. (2011) showed that 18.3% of the entities in Freebase that also occur in the New York Times 2007 corpus (NYT) overlap with more than one relation type. Second, although DS method has shown some promising results, its accuracy suffers from noisy training data caused by two types of problems (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Intxaurrondo et al., 2013; Riedel et al., 2010): (i) possible mismatch between the sentence semantics and the relation type mapped in it, e.g., the KB correct relation, located in(Renzi,Rome), cannot be mapped into the sentence, Renzi does not love the Rome soccer team; and (ii) coverage of the KB, e.g., a sentence can express relations that are not in the KB (this generates false negatives). Several approaches for selecting higher quality training sentences with DS have been studies but comparing such methods is difficult for the lack of well-defined benchmarks and models using DS. In this paper, we aim at building a standard to compare models based on DS: first of all, we considered the most used corpus in DS, i.e., the combination of NYT and Freebase (NYT-FB). Secondly, we mapped the Freebase entity IDs used in NYT-FB from the old version of 2007 to the newer Freebase 2014. Since entities changed, we asked an annotator to manually tag the entity mentions in the sentence. As the result, we created a new dataset usable as a stand-alone DS corpus, which we make available for research purposes. Questo e-book appartiene a AlessandroLenci Finally, all the few RE models experimented with NYT-FB in the past are based on a complex conditional random fields. This is necessary to encode the dependencies between the overlapping relations. Additionally, such models use very particular and sparse features, which make the replicability of the models and results complex, thus limiting the research progress in DS. Indeed, for comparing a new DS approach with the previous work using NYT-FB, the researcher is forced to re-implement a very complicated model and its sparse features. Therefore, we believe that simpler models can bevery useful as (i) a much simpler reimplementation would enable model comparisons and (ii) it would be easier to verify if a DS method is better than another. In this perspective, our proposed approach is based on convolution tree kernels, which can easily exploit syntactic/semantic structures. This is an important aspect to favor replicability of our results. Moreover, our method differers from previous state of the art on overlapping relations (Riedel et al., 2010) as we apply a modification of the simple one-vs-all strategy, instead of the complex graphical models. To make our approach competitive, we studied several parameters for optimizing SVMsandfiltering out noisy negative training examples. Our extensive experiments show that our models achieve satisfactory results.","We have proposed a standard framework, simple RE models and an upgraded version of NYT-FB for more easily measuring the research progress in DS research. Our RE model is based on SVMs, can manage overlapping relations and exploit syntactic information and lexical features thanks to tree kernels. Additionally, we have shown that filtering techniques applied to DS data can discard noisy examples and significantly improve the RE accuracy.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis
2_2014,2014,CLICIT201412.pdf,"Paolo Annesi, Danilo Croce, Roberto Basili",Towards Compositional Tree Kernels,ENG,3,0,0,Università di Roma Tor Vergata,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Rome,"Several textual inference tasks rely on kernel-based learning. In particular Tree Kernels (TKs) proved to be suitable to the modeling of syntactic and semantic similarity between linguistic instances. In order to generalize the meaning of linguistic phrases, Distributional Compositional Semantics (DCS) methods have been defined to compositionally combine the meaning of words in semantic spaces. However, TKs still do not account for compositionality. A novel kernel, i.e. the Compositional Tree Kernel, is presented integrating DCS operators in the TK estimation. The evaluation over Question Classification and Metaphor Detection shows the contribution of semantic compositions w.r.t. traditional TKs.","Tree Kernels (TKs) (Collins and Duffy, 2001) are consolidated similarity functions used in NLP for their ability in capturing syntactic information directly from parse trees and used to solve complex tasks such as Question Answering (Moschitti et al., 2007) or Semantic Textual Similarity (Croce et al., 2012). The similarity between parse tree structures is defined in terms of all possible syntagmatic substructures. Recently, the Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel (SPTK) has been defined in (Croce et al., 2011): the semantic information of the lexical nodes in a parse tree enables a smoothed similarity between structures, which are partially similar and whose nodes can differ but are nevertheless related. Semantic similarity between words is evaluated in terms of vector similarity in a Distributional Semantic Space (Sahlgren, 2006; Turney and Pantel, 2010; Baroni and Lenci, 2010). Even if achieving higher performances w.r.t. traditional TKs, the main limitations of SPTK are that the discrimination between words is delegated only to the lexical nodes and semantic composition of words is not considered. Questo e-book appartiene a AlessandroLenci Weinvestigate a kernel function that exploits semantic compositionality to measures the similarity between syntactic structures. In our perspective the semantic information should be emphasized by compositionally propagating lexical information over an entire parse tree, making explicit the head/modifier relationships between words. It enables the application of Distributional Compositional Semantic (DCS) metrics, that combine lexical representations by vector operator into the distributional space (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Erk and Pado, 2008; Zanzotto et al., 2010; Baroni and Lenci, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Blacoe and Lapata, 2012; Annesi et al., 2012), within the TKs computation. The idea is to i) def ine a procedure to mark nodes of a parse tree that allows to spread lexical bigrams across the tree nodes ii) apply DCS smoothing metrics between such compositional nodes iii) enrich the SPTK formulation with compositional distributional semantics. The resulting model has been called Compositional Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel (CSPTK). The entire process of marking parse trees is described in Section 2. Therefore, in Section 3 the CSPTK is presented. Finally, in Section 4, the evaluations over Question Classification and Metaphor Detection tasks are shown.","In this paper, a novel kernel function has been proposed in order to exploit Distributional Compositional operators within Tree Kernels. The proposed approach propagates lexical semantic information over an entire tree, by building a Compositionally labeled Tree. The resulting Compositional Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel measures the semantic similarity between complex linguistic structures by applying metrics sensible to distributional compositional semantics. Empirical results in the Question Classification and Metaphor Detection tasks demonstrate the positive contribution of compositional information for the generalization capability within the proposed kernel.",22,Distributional Semantics

Starting with a baseline model trained on 1.3K and then on 20K aligned sentences, we tried to cope with the complex morphology of Kazakh by applying different schemes of morphological word segmentation to the training and test data. Morphological segmentation appears to benefit our system: our best segmentation scheme achieved a 28% reduction of out-of-vocabulary rate and 2.7 point BLEU improvement above the baseline.","The availability of considerable amounts of parallel texts in Kazakh and English has motivated us to apply statistical machine translation (SMT) paradigm for building a Kazakh-to-English machine translation system using publicly available data and open-source tools. The main ideas of SMT were introduced by researchers at IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center (Brown et al., 1993). This paradigm implies that translations are generated on the basis of statistical models whose parameters are derived from the analysis of bilingual text corpora. We show how one can compile a Kazakh-English parallel corpus from publicly available resources in Section 2. It is well known that challenges arise in statistical machine translation when we deal with languages with complex morphology, e.g. Kazakh. However recently there were attempts to tackle such challenges for similar languages by morphological pre-processing of the source text (Bisazza and Federico, 2009; Habash and Sadat, 2006; Mermer, 2010). We apply morphological preprocessing techniques to Kazakh side of our corpus and show how they improve translation performance in Sections 5 and 6.","The experiments have shown that a selective morphological segmentation improves the performance of an SMT system. One can see that in contrast to Bisazza and Federico’s results (2009), in our case MS11 downgrades the translation performance. One of the reasons for this might be that Bisazza and Federico considered translation of spokenl anguage in which sentences weres horter on average than in our corpora. In this work we mainly focused on nominal suffixation. In our future work we are planning to: increase the dictionary of morphological transducer – currently it covers 93.3% of our larger corpus; improve morphological disambiguation using e.g. perceptron algorithm (Saket al., 2007); develop more segmentation rules for verbs and other parts of speech; mine more mono- and bilingual data using officia lwebsites of Kazakhstan’s public authorities.",10,Machine Translation

We report on experiments performed on medical data in English provided in the shared tasks at CLEF-ER 2013 and SemEval 2014. This allowed us to refine Named Entity recognition techniques to deal with the specifics of medical and clinical language in particular. We present two approaches for transferring the techniques to Italian. One solution relies on the creation of an Italian corpus of annotated clinical records and the other on adapting existing linguistic tools to the medical domain.,"One of the objectives of the RIS project (RIS 2014) is to develop tools and techniques to help identifying patients at risk of evolving their disease into a chronic condition. The study relies on a sample of patient data consisting of both medical test reports and clinical records. We are interested in verifying whether text analytics, i.e. information extracted from natural language texts, can supplement or improve information extracted from the more structured data available in the medical test records. Clinical records are expressed as plain text in natural language and contain mentions of diseases or symptoms affecting a patient, whose accurate identification is crucial for any further text mining process. Our task in the project is to provide a set of NLP tools for extracting automatically information from medical reports in Italian. We are facing the double challenge of adapting NLP tools to the medical domain and of handling documents in a language (Italian) for which there are few available linguistic resources. Our approach to information extraction exploits both supervised machine-learning tools, which require annotated training corpora, and unsupervised deep learning techniques, in order to leverage unlabeled data. For dealing with the lack of annotated Italian resources for the bio-medical domain, we attempted to create a silver corpus with a semi-automatic approach that uses both machine translation and dictionary based techniques. The corpus will be validated through crowdsourcing.","We presented a series of experiments on biomedical texts from both medical literature and clinical records, in multiple languages, that helped us to refine the techniques of NE recognition and to adapt them to Italian. We explored supervised techniques as well as unsupervised ones, in the form of word embeddings or word clusters. We also developed a Deep Learning NE tagger that exploits embeddings. The best results were achieved by using a MEMM sequence labeler using clusters as features improved in an ensemble combination with other NE taggers. As an further contribution of our work, we produced, by exploiting semi-automated techniques, an Italian corpus of medical records, annotated with mentions of medical terms.",20,In-domain IR and IE

This contribution, which is placed within a wider research of experimental pedagogy, reports the first and promising results of a study aimed at monitoring the evolution of the Italian language learning process conducted from the written production of students with tools of automatic linguistic notification and knowledge extraction.","The use of language technologies for the study of learning processes and, in more applied terms, the construction of the so-called Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning systems (ICALL) `and more and more at the center of interdisciplinary research that aims to highlight how methods and tools of automatic language notification and knowledge extraction are now mature to be used also in the educational and school context. On the international level, this is demonstrated by the success of the Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications (BEA), arrived puts in this research context, reporting the first results of a study still ongoing, aimed at describing, with means of quantitative and qualitative character, the evolution of the writing skills, both at the level of text content and linguistic skills, from the first to the second class of the secondary school. It is an exploration work aimed at building an empirical analysis model that allows the observation of the processes and products of the teaching of written production. The innovative character of this research in the national and international landscape is placed at various levels. The research described here represents the first study aimed at monitoring the evolution of the language learning process of the Italian language conducted from the written production of the students and with tools of automatic language notification and knowledge extraction. The use of language technologies for monitoring the evolution of language skills of learners drops the roots in a branch of studies launched internationally in the last decade and within which language analysis generated by tools of automatic language treatment are used, for example, to: monitor the development of synthesis in child language (Sagae et al., 2005; Lu, 2007); identify cognitive deficits through measures of synthetic complexity (Roark et al., 2007) or of semantic association (Rouhizadeh et al., 2013); monitor the reading capacity as a central component of language competence (Schwarmend and Ostendorf, 2005; and Petersen, 2009). Take the moves from this research branch, Dell‚ÄôOrletta and Montemagni (2012) and Dell‚ÄôOrletta et al. (2011) they showed in two feasibility studies that linguistic-computer technologies can play a central role in evaluating the Italian language skills of students in the school and in tracing their evolution over time. This contribution represents an original and innovative development of this research line, as the language monitoring methodology proposed `and used within a wider study of experimental pedagogy, based on a significant corpus of written productions of students and aimed at tracing the evolution of skills in a diacronic and/or socio-cultural perspective. The subject of the analyses represents another element of novit`a: `and was chosen the first twentieth of first-degree secondary school as a school area to be analyzed because' and little investigated by empirical research and because' and have been few so far the studies that have verified the effective teaching practice derived from the indications provided by the ministerial programs relating to this school cycle, from 1979 to the National Indications of 2012.","The comparative monitoring of the language characteristics traced in the corpus of common tests carried out in the first and second year was carried out with the aim of tracing the evolution of the language skills of the students in the two years. The ANOVA common evidence shows that there are significant differences between the first and second years at all levels of linguistic analysis considered. For example, compared to the Odi base‚Äô cattery, it turns out that the variation of the average number of tokens per phrase in the two tests of the two years is significant. While the tests written in the first year contain long phrases in an average of 23.82 tokens, the average length of the tests in the second year is 20.71 tokens. Significant `and also the variation in the use of VdB-related voices, which decreases from 83% of the vocabulary in the first year tests to 79% in the second year, such as the TTR values (related to the first 100 tokens), which increase by passing from 0.66 to 0.69. In both cases, such changes can be seen as a result of a lessical enrichment. When it comes to the morphosynthetic level, the characteristics that capture the use of times and verbal ways are significant. At the level of synthetic monitoring, `and for example the use of the object supplement in pre‚Äì or post-verbal position to vary significantly. If in the first year‚Äôs tests 19% of the subject complements are in pre-verbal position, in the second year the percentage decreases by passing to 13%; while in the first year the post-verbal complements are 81% and increase by passing to 87% in the second year. In the tests of the second year therefore is observed a greater respect for the canonical order subject-word-object, closer to the rules of the writing than of the spoken. Although the results are still preliminary compared to the wider context of research, we believe they clearly show the potential of the meeting between computing and educational linguistics, opening new research prospects. Current activities include the analysis of the correlation between the evidence acquired through linguistic monitoring and the process and background variables such as the study of the evolution of the language skills of the individual student.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

The distinctive trait of ironic utterances is the opposition of literal and intended meaning. This characteristic makes the automatic recognition of irony a challenging task for current systems. In this paper we present and evaluate the first automated system targeted to detect irony in Italian Tweets, introducing and exploiting a set of linguistic features useful for this task.","Sentiment Analysis is the interpretation of attitudes and opinions of subjects on certain topics. With the growth of social networks, Sentiment Analysis has become fundamental for customer reviews, opinion mining, and natural language user interfaces (Yasavur et al., 2014). During the last decade the number of investigations dealing with sentiment analysis has considerably increased, targeting most of the time English language. Comparatively and to the best of our knowledge there are only few works for the Italian language. In this paper we explore an important sentiment analysis problem: irony detection. Irony is a linguistic device used to say something when meaning something else (Quintilien and Butler, 1953). Dealing with figurative languages is one of the biggest challanges to correctly determine the polarity of a text: analysing phrases where literal and indented meaning are not the same, is hard for humans, hence even harder for machines. Moreover, systems able of detect irony can benefit also other A.I. areas like Human Computer Interaction. Approaches to detect irony have been already proposed for English, Portuguese and Dutch texts (see Section 2). Some of these systems used words, or word-patterns as irony detection features (Davidov et al., 2010; Gonz´ alez-Ib´ a˜ nez et al., 2011; Reyes et al., 2013; Buschmeier et al., 2014). Other approaches, like Barbieri and Saggion (2014a), exploited lexical and semantic features of single words like their frequency in reference corpora or the number of associated synsets. Relying on the latter method, in this paper we present the first system for automatic detection of irony in Italian Tweets. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of Decision Trees in classifying Tweets as ironic or not ironic, showing that classification performances increase by considering lexical and semantic features of single words instead of pure bag-of-words (BOW) approaches. To train our system, we exploited as ironic examples the Tweets from the account of a famous collective blog named Spinoza and as not ironic examples the Tweets retrieved from the timelines of seven popular Italian newspapers.","In this study we evaluate a novel system to detect irony in Italian, focusing on Tweets. We tackle this problem as binary classification, where the ironic examples are posts of the Twitter account Spinoza and the non-ironic examples are Tweets from seven popular Italian newspapers. We evaluated the effectiveness of Decision Trees with different feature sets to carry out this classification task. Our system only focuses on characteristics on lexical and semantic information that characterises each word, rather than the words themselves as features. The performance of the system is good if compared to our baseline (BOW) considering only word occurrences as features, since we obtain an F1 improvement of 0.11. This result shows the suitability of our approach to detect ironic Italian Tweets. However, there is space to enrich and tune the model as this is only a first approach. It is possible to both improve the model with new features (for example related to punctuation or language models) and evaluate the system on new and extended corpora of Italian Tweets as they become available. Another issue we faced is the lack of accurate evaluations of features performance considering distinct classifiers / algorithms for irony detection.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Many automatic crossword puz-zle solvers are based on database system accessing previously resolved crossword puzzles. Our approach consists in query-ing the database (DB) with a search engine and converting its output into a probability score, which combines in a single scoring model, i.e., a logistic regression model, both the search engine score and statisti-cal similarity features. This improved re-trieval model greatly impacts the resolu-tion accuracy of crossword puzzles.","Crossword Puzzles (CPs) are probably one of the most popular language game. Automatic CP solvers have been mainly targeted by the artificial intelligence (AI) community, who has mostly fo-cused on AI techniques for filling the puzzle grid, given a set of answer candidates for each clue. The basic idea is to optimize the overall probability of correctly filling the entire grid by exploiting the likelihood of each candidate answer, fulfilling at the same time the grid constraints. After several failures in approaching the human expert perfor-mance, it has become clear that designing more accurate solvers would not have provided a win-ning system. In contrast, the Precision and Recall of the answer candidates are obviously a key fac-tor: very high values for these performance mea-sures would enable the solver to quickly find the correct solution. Similarly to the Jeopardy! challenge case (Fer-rucci et al., 2010), the solution relies on Ques-tion Answering (QA) research. However, although some CP clues are rather similar to standard ques-tions, there are some specific differences: (i) clues can be in interrogative form or not, e.g., Capi-tale d’Italia: Roma; (ii) they can contain riddles or be deliberately ambiguous and misleading (e.g., Se fugge sono guai: gas ); (iii) the exact length of the answer keyword is known in advance; and (vi) the confidence in the answers is an extremely important input for the CP solver. Questo e-book appartiene a AlessandroLenci There have been many attempts to build automatic CP solving systems. Their goal is to outperform human players in solving crosswords more accurately and in less time. Proverb (Littman et al., 2002) was the first system for the automatic resolution of CPs. It includes several modules for generating lists of candidate answers. These lists are merged and used to solve a ProbabilisticConstraint Satisfaction Problem. Proverb relies on a very large crossword database as well as several expert modules, each of them mainly based on domain-specific databases (e.g., movies, writers and geography). WebCrow (Ernandes et al., 2005) is based on Proverb. In addition to its predecessor, WebCrow carries out basic linguistic analysis such as Part-Of-Speech tagging and lemmatization. It takes advantage of semantic relations contained in WordNet, dictionaries and gazetteers. Its Web module is constituted by a search engine, which can retrieve text snippets or documents related to the clue. WebCrow uses a WA* algorithm (Pohl, 1970) for Probabilistic-Constraint Satisfaction Problems, adapted for CP resolution. To the best of our knowledge, the state-of-the-art system for automatic CP solving is Dr. Fill (Ginsberg, 2011). It targets the crossword filling task with a Weighted-Constraint Satisfaction Problem. Constraint violations are weighted and can be tolerated. It heavily relies on huge databases of clues. All of these systems queries the DB of previously solved CP clues using standard techniques, e.g., SQL Full-Text query. The DB is a very rich and important knowledge base. In order to improve the quality of the automatic extraction of answer candidate lists from DB, we provide for the Italian language a completely novel solution, by substituting the DB and the SQL function with a search engine for retrieving clues similar to the target one. In particular, we define a reranking function for the retrieved clues based on a logistic regression model (LRM), which combines the search engine score with other similarity features. To carry out our study, we created a clue similarity dataset for the Italian language. This dataset constitutes an interesting resource that we made available to the research community.","In this paper we improve the answer extraction from DB for automatic CP resolution. We combined the state-of-the-art BM25 retrieval model and an LRM by converting the BM25 score into a probability score for each answer candidate. For our study and to test our methods, we created a corpora for clue similarity containing clues in Italian. We improve on the lists generated by WebCrow by 8.5 absolute percent points in MRR. However, the end-to-end CP resolution test does not show a large improvement as the percentage of retrieved clues is not high enough.",1,Language Models

The proposed method is able to build a geometrical space considering several pe-riods of time. This methodology enables the analysis of the time evolution of the meaning of a word. Exploiting this ap-proach, we build a framework, called Tem-poral Random Indexing (TRI) that pro-vides all the necessary tools for building WordSpaces and performing such linguis-tic analysis. We propose some examples of usage of our tool by analysing word meanings in two corpora: a collection of Italian books and English scientific papers about computational linguistics.","The analysis of word-usage statistics over huge corpora has become a common technique in many corpus linguistics tasks, which benefit from the growth rate of available digital text and compu-tational power. Better known as Distributional Semantic Models (DSM), such methods are an easy way for building geometrical spaces of con-cepts, also known as Semantic (or Word) Spaces, by skimming through huge corpora of text in order to learn the context of usage of words. In the re-sulting space, semantic relatedness/similarity be-tween two words is expressed by the closeness be-tween word-points. Thus, the semantic similarity can be computed as the cosine of the angle be-tween the two vectors that represent the words. DSM can be built using different techniques. One common approach is the Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), which is based on the Singular Value Decomposition of the word co-occurrence matrix. However, many other methods that try to take into account the word order (Jones and Mewhort, 2007) or predications (Cohen et al., 2010) have been proposed. Recursive Neural Net-work (RNN) methodology (Mikolov et al., 2010) and its variant proposed in the word2vect frame-work (Mikolov et al., 2013) based on the con-tinuous bag-of-words and skip-gram model take a complete new perspective. However, most of these techniques build such SemanticSpaces tak-ing a snapshot of the word co-occurrences over the linguistic corpus. This makes the study of seman-tic changes during different periods of time diffi-cult to be dealt with. In this paper we show how one of such DSM techniques, called Random Indexing (RI) (Sahlgren, 2005; Sahlgren, 2006), can be easily extended to allow the analysis of semantic changes of words over time. The ultimate aim is to provide a tool which enables to understand how words change their meanings within a document corpus as a function of time. We choose RI for two main reasons: 1) the method is incremental and requires few computational resources while still retaining good performance; 2) the methodology for building the space can be easily expanded to integrate temporal information. Indeed, the disadvantage of classical DSM approaches is that WordSpaces built on different corpus are not comparable: it is always possible to compare similarities in terms of neighbourhood words or to combine vectors by geometrical operators, such as the tensor product, but these techniques do not allow a direct comparison of vectors belonging to two different spaces. Our approach based on RI is able to build a WordSpace on different time periods and makes all these spaces comparable to each another, actually enabling the analysis of word meaning changes over time by simple vector operations in WordSpaces. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides details about the adopted methodology and the implementation of our framework. Some examples of the potentiality of our framework are reported in Section 3. Lastly, Section 4 closes the paper.","We propose a method for building WordSpaces taking into account information about time. In a WordSpace, words are represented as mathemati-cal points and the similarity is computed accord-ing to their closeness. The proposed framework, called TRI , is able to build several WordSpaces in different time periods and to compare vectors across the spaces to understand how the meaning of a word has changed over time. We reported some examples of our framework, which show the potential of our system in capturing word usage changes over time.",22,Distributional Semantics

Since its original formula-tion, several variations of this algorithm have been proposed in an attempt of reducing its complex-ity, like the simplified Lesk (Kilgarriff and Rosen-zweig, 2000; Vasilescu et al., 2004), or maximizing the chance of overlap, like in the adapted version (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002). One of the limitations of Lesk approach relies on the exact match between words in the sense definitions. Semantic similarity, rather than word overlap, has been proposed as a method to overcome such a limitation. Earlier approaches were based on the notion of semantic relatedness (Patwardhan et al., 2003) and tried to exploit the relationships between synsets in the WordNet graph. More recently, Distributional Semantic Models (DSM) have stood up as a way for computing such semantic similarity. DSM allow the representation of concepts in a geometrical space through word vectors. This kind of representation captures the semantic relatedness that occurs between words in paradigmatic relations, and enables the computation of semantic similarity between whole sentences. Broadening the definition of semantic relatedness, Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) took into account WordNet contexts: a gloss vector is built for each word sense using its definition and those of related synsets in WordNet. A distributional thesaurus is used for the expansion of both glosses and the context in Miller et al. (2012), where the overlap is computed as in the original Lesk algorithm. More recently, Basile et al. (2014) proposed a variation of Lesk algorithm based on both the simplified and the adapted version. This method combines the enhanced overlap, given by the definitions of related synsets, with the reduced number of matching that are limited to the contextual words in the simplified version. The evaluation was conducted on the SemEval-2013 Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation task (Navigli et al., 2013), and involved the use of BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012) as sense inventory. While performance for the English task was above the other task participants, the same behaviour was not reported for the Italian language. This paper proposes a deeper investigation of the algorithm described in Basile et al. (2014) for the Italian language. We analyse the effect on the disambiguation performance of the use of two different corpora for building the distributional space. Moreover, we introduce a new sense distribution function (SDfreq), based on synset frequency, and compare its capability in boosting the distributional Lesk algorithm with respect to the one proposed in Basile et al. (2014). The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides details about the Distributional Lesk algorithm and DSM, and defines the two above mentioned sense distribution functions exploited in this work. The evaluation, along with details about the two corpora and how the DSM are built, is presented in Section 3, which is followed by some conclusions about the presented results.","This paper proposed an analysis for the Italian language of anenhanced version of Lesk algorithm, which replaces the word overlap with distributional similarity. We analysed two DSM built over the ItWaC and Wikipedia corpus along with two sense distribution functions (SDprob and SDfreq). The sense distribution functions were computed over MultiSemCor, in order to avoid missing references between Italian and English synsets. The combination of the ItWaC-based DSM with the SDprob function resulted in the best overall result for the Italian portion of SemEvalTask-12 dataset.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Using WordNet as a foundational ontology, we exploit its internal network structure to predict the best lemmas for a given synset without the need for annotated data. Experiments based on re-generation and automatic evaluation show that our novel algorithm is more effective than a straightforward frequency-based approach.","Many linguists argue that true synonyms don’t exist (Bloomfield, 1933; Bolinger, 1968). Yet, words with similar meanings do exist and they play an important role in language technology where lexical resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) employ synsets, sets of synonyms that cluster words with the same or similar meaning. It would be wrong to think that any member of a synset would be an equally good candidate for every application. Consider for instance the synset food, nutrient , a concept whose gloss in WordNet is “any substance that can be metabolized by an animal to give energy and build tissue”. In (1), this needs to be realized as “food”, but in (2) as “nutrient”. 1. It said the loss was significant in a region where fishing provides a vital source of foodnutrient. 2. The Kind-hearted Physician administered a stimulant, a tonic, and a foodnutrient, and went away. A straightforward solution based on n-gram models or grammatical constraint (“a food” is ungrammatical in the example above) is not always applicable, since it would be necessary to generate the complete sentence first, to exploit such features. This problem of lexical choice is what we want to solve in this paper. In a way it can be regarded as the reverse of WordNet-based Word Sense Disambiguation, where instead of determining the right synset for a certain word in a given context, the problem is to decide which word of a synset is the best choice in a given context. Lexical choice is a key task in the larger framework of Natural Language Generation, where an ideal model has to produce varied, naturalsounding utterances. In particular, generation from purely semantic structures, carrying little to no syntactic or lexical information, needs solutions that do not depend on pre-made choices of words to express generic concepts. The input to a lexical choice component in this context is some abstract representation of meaning that may specify to different extent the linguistic features that the expected output should have. Questo e-book appartiene a AlessandroLenci WordNet synsets are good candidate representations of word meanings, as WordNet could be seen as a dictionary, where each synset has its own definition in written English. WordNet synsets are also well suited for lexical choice, because they consist in actual sets of lemmas, considered to be synonyms of each other in specific contexts. Thus, the problem presented here is restricted to the choice of lemmas from WordNet synsets. Despite its importance, the task of lexical choice problem is not broadly considered by the NLGcommunity,oneofthereasonsbeingthatitis hard to evaluate. Information retrieval techniques fail to capture not-so-wrong cases, i.e. when a system produces a different lemma from the gold standard but still appropriate to the context. In this paper we present an unsupervised methodtoproducelemmasfromWordNetsynsets, inspired by the literature on WSD and applicable to every abstract meaning representation that provides links from concepts to WordNet synsets.","In this paper we presented an unsupervised algorithm for lexical choice from WordNet synsets called Ksel that exploits the WordNet hierarchy of hypernyms/hyponyms to produce the most appropriate lemma for a given synset. Ksel performs better than an already high baseline based on the frequency of lemmas in an annotated corpus. The future direction of this work is at least twofold. On the one hand, being based purely on a lexical resource, the Ksel approach lends itself nicely to be applied to different languages by leveraging multi-lingual resources like BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). On the other hand, we want to exploit existing annotated corpora such as the GMB to solve the lexical choice problem in a supervised fashion, that is, ranking candidate lemmas based on features of the semantic structure, in the same track of our previous work on generation from work-aligned logical forms (Basile and Bos, 2013).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The system we are developing in the context of the “Pro-getto Traduzione del Talmud Babilonese” has been designed to improve the expe-rience of collaborative translation using Computer-Assisted Translation technolo-gies and providing a rich environment for the creation of comments and the annota-tion of text on a linguistic and semantic ba-sis.","Alongside the Bible, the Babylonian Talmud (BT) is the Jewish text that has mostly influenced Jew-ish life and thought over the last two millennia. The BT corresponds to the effort of late antique scholars (Amoraim) to provide an exegesis of the Mishnah, an earlier rabbinic legal compilation, di-vided in six “orders” (sedarim) corresponding to different categories of Jewish law, with a total of 63 tractates (massekhtaot). Although following the inner structure of the Mishnah, the BT dis-cusses only 37 tractates, with a total of 2711 dou-ble sided folia in the printed edition (Vilna, XIX century). The BT is a comprehensive literary cre-ation, which went through an intricate process of oral and written transmission, was expanded in every generations before its final redaction, and has been the object of explanatory commentaries and reflexions from the Medieval Era onwards. In its long history of formulation, interpretation, transmission and study, the BT reflects inner de-velopments within the Jewish tradition as well as the interactions between Judaism and the cultures with which the Jews came into contact (Strack and Stemberger, 1996). In the past decades, online resources for studying Rabbinic literature have considerably increased and several digital collec-tions of Talmudic texts and manuscripts are nowa-days available (Lerner, 2010). Particularly, schol-ars as well as a larger public of users can bene-fit from several new computing technologies ap-plied to the research and the study of the BT, such as (i.) HTML (Segal, 2006), (ii.) optical char-acter recognition, (iii.) three-dimensional com-puter graphics (Small, 1999), (iv.) text encod-ing, text and data mining (v.) image recognition (Wolf et al., 2011(a); Wolf et al., 2011(b); Shweka et al., 2013), and (vi.) computer-supported learning environments (Klamma et al., 2005; Klamma et al., 2002). In the context of the “Progetto Traduzione del Talmud Babilonese”, the Institute for Computational Linguistics of the Italian National Research Council (ILC-CNR) is in charge of developing a collaborative Java-EE web application for the translation of the BT into Italian by a team of translators. The Talmud System (TS) already includes Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT), Knowledge Engineering and Digital Philology tools, and, in future versions, will include Natural Language Processing tools for Hebrew/Aramaic, each of which will be outlined in detail in the next Sections.","We here introduced the Talmud System, a collaborative web application for the translation of the Babylonian Talmud into Italian integrating technologies belonging to the areas of (i.)

While outlining the general charac-teristics of the system, the paper presen-ts a minimal set of user requirements and provides a possible use case on Dante’s Inferno.","A text represents a multifaceted object, resulting from the intersection of different expressive layers (graphemic, phonetic, syntactic, lexico-semantic, ontological, etc.). A text is always created by a writer with a specific attempt to outline a certain subject in a particular way. Even when it is not a literary creation, a given text follows its wri-ter’s specific intention and is written in a distinct form. The text creator’s intention is not always self-evident and, even when it is, a written piece might convey very different meanings proportio-nally to the various readers analysing it. Texts can be seen, in fact, as communication media between writers and readers. Regardless of the epistemolo-gical theory about where meaning emerges in the reader-text relationship (Objectivism, Constructi-vism, Subjectivism), a text needs a reader as much as a writer to be expressive (Chandler, 1995). The reader goes beyond the explicit information given in the text, by making certain inferences and eva-luations, according to his/her background, expe-rience, knowledge and purpose. Therefore, inter-pretation depends on both the nature of the given text and the reader/interpreter; it can be understood as the goal, the process and the outcome of the analytic activity conducted by a certain reader on a given text under specific circumstances. Interpretation corresponds to the different– virtually infinite– mental frameworks and cognitive mechanisms activated in a certain reader/interpreter when examining a given text. The nature of the interpretation of a given text can be philological, historical, psychological, etc.; a psychological interpretation can be Freudian, Jungian, etc... Furthermore, the different categories of literary criticism and the various interpretative approaches might be very much blurred and intertwined, i.e. an historical interpretation might involve philological, anthropological, political and religious analyses. While scholars are generally aware of their mental process of selection and categorization when reading/interpreting a text and, thus, can re-adjust their interpretative approach while they operate, an automatic system has often proved unf it for qualitative analysis due to the complexity of text meaning and text interpretation (Harnad, 1990). Nevertheless, a few semi-automatic systems for qualitative interpretation have been proposed in the last decades. The most outstanding of them is ATLAS.ti, a commercial system for qualitative analysis of unstructured data, which has been applied in the early nineties to text interpretation (Muhr, 1991). ATLAS.ti, however, appears too general to respond to the articulated needs of a scholar studying a text, lacking of advanced text analysis tools and automatic knowledge extraction features. The University of Southampton and Birkbeck University are currently working on a commercial project, SAMTLA1, aimed to create a language-agnostic research environment for studying textual corpora with the aid of computational technologies. In the past, concerning the interpretation of literary texts, the introduction of text annotation approaches and the adoption of high-level markup languages allowed to go beyond the typical use of concordances (DeVuyst, 1990; Sutherland, 1990; Sperberg-Mc Queen and Burnard, 1994). In this context, several works have been proposed for the study of Dante’s Commedia. One of the first works involved the definition of a meta representation of the text of the Inferno and the construction of an ontology formalizing a portion of Dante’s Commedia’s world (Cappelli et al., 2002). Data mining procedures able to conceptually query the aforementioned resources have also been implemented (Baglioni et al., 2004). Among the other works on Dante we cite The World of Dante (Parker, 2001), Digital Dante of the Columbia University (LeLoup and Ponterio, 2006) and the Princeton Dante Project (Hollander, 2013). A “multidimensional” social network of characters, places and events of Dante’s Inferno have been constructed to make evident the innermost structure of the text (Cappelli et al., 2011) by leveraging on the expressive power of graph representations of data (Newman, 2003; Newmanetal., 2006; Easley and Kleinberg, 2010; Meirelles, 2013). A touch table approach to Dante’s Inferno, based on the same social network representation, has been also implemented (Bordin et al., 2013). More recently, a semantic network of Dante’s works has been developed alongside a RDF representation of the knowledge embedded in them (Tavoni et al., 2014). Other works involving text interpretation and graph representations have been carried out on other literary texts, such as Alice in Wonderland (Agarwal et al., 2012) and Promessi Sposi (Bolioli et al., 2013). As discussed by semiologists, linguists and literary scholars (Eco, 1979; Todorov, 1973; Segre, 1985; Roque, 2012) the interpretation of a text may require a complex structuring and interrelation of the information belonging to its different expressive layers. The Decision Support System (DSS) we here introduce aims to assist scholars in their research projects, by providing them with semi-automatic tools specifically developed to support the interpretation of texts at different and combined layers. Wechose to start from the analysis of literary texts to be able to face the most challenging aspects related to text interpretation. This work is the third of a series describing the progressive development of the general approach: for the others refer to (Bellandi et al., 2013; Bellandi et al., 2014). In what follows, we describe the general characteristics of the DSS we plan to develop accompanied by aminimal set of user requirements (2.), we present a possible scenario, in which the system can be applied (3.), and we provide some conclusive notes (4.).","In this work, we presented our vision of a Decision Support System for the analysis and interpretation of texts. In addition to outlining the general characteristics of the system, we illustrated a case study on Dante’s Inferno showing how the study of a text can involve elements belonging to three different layers (ontological, dialogical and terminological) thus allowing to take into account, in an innovative way, both textual and contextual elements. The next steps will consist in the extension of the user requirements and the design of the main components of the system. We plan to start with the basic features allowing a user to create a project and upload documents and then provide the minimal text processing tools necessary for the definition and management of (at least) the graphemic layer.",5,Latin Resources

Textual en-tailment graphs capture relevant semantic relations among text fragments, including equivalence and entailment, and are pro-posed as an informative and compact rep-resentation for a variety of text exploration applications.","Given the large production and availability of tex-tual data in several contexts, there is an increasing need for representations of such data that are able at the same time to convey the relevant informa-tion contained in the data and to allow compact and efficient text exploration. As an example, cus-tomer interaction analytics requires tools that al-low for a fine-grained analysis of the customers’ messages (e.g. complaining about a particular as-pect of a particular service or product) and, at the same time, allow to speed up the search process, which commonly involves a huge amount of in-teractions, on different channels (e.g. telephone calls, emails, posts on social media), and in differ-ent languages. A relevant proposal in this direction has been the definition of textual entailment graphs (Berant et al., 2010), where graph nodes represent predi-cates (e.g. marry(x, y)), and edges represent the entailment relations between pairs of predicates. This recent research line in Computational Lin-guistics capitalizes on results obtained in the last ten years in the field of Recognizing Textual En-tailment (Dagan et al., 2009), where a successful series of shared tasks have been organized to show and evaluate the ability of systems to draw text-to-text semantic inferences. In this paper we present a linguistic resource consisting of a collection of textual entailment graphs derived from real customer interactions in Italian social fora, which is our motivating sce-nario. We extend the earlier, predicate-based, vari-ant of entailment graphs to capture entailment re-lations among more complex text fragments. The resource is meant to be used both for training and evaluating systems that can automatically build entailment graphs from a stream of customer in-teractions. Then, entailment graphs are used to browse large amount of interactions by call cen-ter managers, who can efficiently monitor the main reasons for customers’ calls. We present the methodology for the creation of the dataset as well as statistics about the collected data. This work has been carried out in the context of the EXCITEMENT project1, in which a large European consortium aims at developing a shared software infrastructure for textual inferences, i.e. the EXCITEMENT Open Platform2 (Padó et al., 2014; Magnini et al., 2014), and at experimenting new technology (i.e. entailment graphs) for customer interaction analytics.","We have presented a new linguistic resource for Italian, based on textual entailment graphs derived from real customer interactions. We see a twofold role of this resource: (i) on one side it provides empirical evidences of the important role of semantic relations and provides insights for new developments of the textual entailment framework; (ii) on the other side, a corpus of textual entailment graphs is crucial for the realization and evaluation of automatic systems that can build entailment graphs for concrete application scenarios.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

So far, however, all computing attempts aimed at the automatic recognition of irony have limited themselves to searching for linguistic indications that could indicate their presence without considering pragmatic and contextual factors. In this work, we tried to evaluate the possibility of integrating simple computing contextual factors with language-type information in order to improve the effectiveness of automatic irony recognition systems in the comments of online newspapers.","Verbal irony is a very complex rhetoric figure that is placed at the pragmatic level of the language. As far as an ironist can use phonological, prosodial, morphological, lessical, synthetic and semantic elements to produce irony, this latter is not an internal property of the enunciated itself and is not determined by its formal characteristics. The irony is rather an interpretative phenomenon linked to the expectations that a listener develops regarding the author‚Äôs intentions of an enunciated product in a specific context starting from an extinct set of encyclopedic and contextual information.","This work has been presented with the possibility of using contextual information to automatically identify irony in the comments of the usual readers of online newspapers. For this purpose, a possible computing approach was proposed to identify the more ironic commentators of a community, suggesting a different treatment of the linguistic material between them and the other commentators. The integration of contextual information and language information could have a positive impact on the effectiveness of automatic irony recognition systems, which would have an important role in the field of Sentiment Analysis. Currently we are expanding research by evaluating the influence of information such as the type of newspaper, the topic of the news and the length of the comment on a broader and built on multiple newspapers comment corpus. Obviously, an integration of contextual information as basic would not completely solve the problem of how to automatically identify irony in online texts. However, this work reflects the firm belief that these progressive attempts to integrate simple and computable contextual information with linguistic information are today the best way to go to attempt to automatically address phenomena of pragmatic nature as ‚Äúcomplex and disfaced‚Äù as irony.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Dif-ferently from previously proposed syllab-ifiers, our approach is more user-friendly since the Python algorithm includes both a Command-Line User and a Graphical User interfaces. Moreover, phonemes, classes and rules are listed in an external configuration file of the tool which can be easily modified by any user. Syllabifica-tion performance is consistent with man-ual annotation. This algorithm is included in SPPAS, a software for automatic speech segmentation, and distributed under the terms of the GPL license.","This paper presents an approach to automatic de-tection of syllable boundaries for Italian speech. This syllabifier makes use of the phonetized text. The syllable is credited as a linguistic unit con-ditioning both segmental (e.g., consonant or vowel lengthening) and prosodic phonology (e.g., tune-text association, rhythmical alternations) and its automatic annotation represent a valuable tool for quantitative analyses of large speech data sets. While the phonological structure of the syllable is similar across different languages, phonolog-ical and phonotactic rules of syllabification are language-specific. Automatic approaches to syl-lable detection have thus to incorporate such con-straints to precisely locate syllable boundaries. The question then arises of how to obtain an ac-ceptable syllabification for a particular language and for a specific corpus (a list of words, a writ-ten text or an oral corpus of more or less casual speech). In the state-of-the-art, the syllabification can be made directly from a text file as in (Cioni, 1997), or directly from the speech signal as in (Petrillo and Cutugno, 2003). There are two broad approaches to the prob-lem of the automatic syllabification: a rule-based approach and a data-driven approach. The rule-based method effectively embodies some theoret-ical position regarding the syllable, whereas the data-driven paradigm tries to infer new syllabifica-tions from examples syllabified by human experts. In (Adsett et al., 2009), three rule-based automatic systems and two data-driven automatic systems (Syllabification by Analogy and the Look-Up Pro-cedure) are compared to syllabify a lexicon. Indeed, (Cioni, 1997) proposed an algorithm for the syllabification of written texts in Italian, by syllabifying words directly from a text. It is an algorithm of deterministic type and it is based upon the use of recursion and of binary tree in order to detect the boundaries of the syllables within each word. The outcome of the algorithm is the production of the so-called canonical syllabification (the stream of syllabified words). On the other side, (Petrillo and Cutugno, 2003) presented an algorithm for speech syllabification directly using the audio signal for both English and Italian. The algorithm is based on the detection of the most relevant energy maxima, using two different energy calculations: the former from the original signal, the latter from a low-pass filtered version. This method allows to perform the syllabification with the audio signal only, so without any lexical information. More recently, (Iacoponi and Savy, 2011) developed a complete rule-based syllabifier for Italian (named Sylli) that works on phonemic texts. The rules are then based on phonological principles. The system is composed of two transducers (one for the input and one for the output), the syllabification algorithm and the mapping list (i.e., the vocabulary). The two transducers convert the twodimensional linear input to a three-dimensional phonological form that is necessary for the processing in the phonological module and then sends the phonological form back into a linear string for output printing. The system achieved good performances compared to a manual syllabification: more than 0.98.5% (syllabification of spoken words). This system is distributed as a package written in C language and must be compiled; the program is an interactive test program that is used in command-line mode. After the program reads in the phone set definition and syllable structure parameters, it loops asking for the user to type in a phonetic transcription, calculating syllable boundaries for it, and then displaying them. When the user types in a null string, the cycling stops and execution ends. Finally, there are two main limitations: this tool is only dedicated to computer scientists, and it does not support time-aligned input data. With respect to these already existing approaches and/or systems, the novel aspect of the work reported in this paper is as follows: to propose a generic and easy-to-use tool to identify syllabic segments from phonemes; to propose a generic algorithm, then a set of rules for the particular context of Italian spontaneous speech. In this context, ”generic” means that the phone set, the classes and the rules are easily changeable; and ”easy-to-use” means that the system can be used by any user.","The paper presented a new feature of the SPPAS tool that lets the user provide syllabification rules and perform automatic segmentation by means of a well-designed graphical user interface. The sys-tem is mainly dedicated to linguists that would like to design and test their own set of rules. A man-ual verification of the output of the program con-firmed the accuracy of the proposed set of rules for syllabification of dialogues. Furthermore, the rules or the list of phonemes can be easily modi-fied by any user. Possible uses of the program in-clude speech corpus syllabification, dictionary syl-labification, and quantitative syllable analysis.",13,Multimodal

It aims at the study of the intertextuality between epigraphic and literary epigrams in Greek, Latin, Arabic and Ital-ian languages. Some of those epigrams are trans-lated in more languages. Currently the access to the website (http://memoratapoetis.it) is restricted to the project workgroups but the access will be public before the end of the project, i.e. February 2016. To understand the specific goal of this work in progress, a broader presentation of the project is necessary. Epigrams are short poems and follow specific schemes, contents and structures. Those short poems are transmitted both by epigraphs and by manuscripts, with interesting relations between the different traditions: an epigram can have been copied from stone to parchment, losing its original function and contextualization or, on the contrary, a literary epigram can have been adapted to a new epigraphic situation. As inscription, epigrams are a communication device inserted in a cultural con-struct. They are part of an information system and this implies, in addition to texts and their linguis-tics aspects: writings, contexts and iconotextual relationships. This holistic and systemic construc-tion creates meanings: in Antiquity and in Middle-Ages, for instance, epigrams, as inscriptions, were often epitaphs. Intertextuality also takes into account this rela-tion between images of the context and the epi-grams. For instance, “fountain” is a redundant motive in epigrams. An epigram that refers to divinities of water could be inscribed on a foun-tain. Such epigraphic situation participates to the global meaning. It helps to study the original audience and the transmission of epigrams. The reuse of themes and motifs illustrates how au-thors work and may influence other authors. From epigraphs to modern edition of epigrams, intertex-tuality draws the movement of languages and con-cepts across the history of epigrams. Here is an example of a poetic English translation of a Theocritus’ epigram: XV. [For a Tripod Erected by Damoteles to Bacchus] The precentor Damoteles, Bacchus, exalts / Your tripod, and, sweetest of deities, you. / He was champion of men, if his boyhood had faults; / And he ever loved honour and seemliness too. (transl. by Calverly, 1892, https: //archive.org/details/Theocritus/ TranslatedIntoEnglishVerseByC.s. Calverley) Effectively, European cultures enjoyed epigrams since the Antiquity, copied them, translated them, and epigrams became a genre that philology studies ardently. This intercultural process transforms epigrams and, at the same time, tries to keep their essence identifiable in those themes and motifs. Naturally, those themes and motifs, such as “braveness”, “pain”, “love” or more concretely “rose”, “shield”, “bee” are reflecting the concepts in use in several different languages. The Memorata Poetis Project tries to capture metrical, lexical and semantic relations among the document of this heterogeneous multilingual corpus. The study of intertextuality is important to understand the transmission of knowledge from author to author, from epoch to epoch, or from civilization to civilization. Even if the mechanisms of the transmission are not explicit, traces can be found through allusions, or thematic similarities. If the same themes are expressed through the same motif(s), probably there is a relation between the civilizations, which express this concept in a literary form, independently by the language in which it is expressed. For instance, the concept of the shortness of life and the necessity to enjoy this short time is expressed both in Greek and Latin literature: Anthologia Graeca 11, 56 PØne kaÈ eÎfraÐnou. tÐ gr aÖrion « tÐ tä mèllon, / oÎdeÈc gin¸skei. (transl.: Drink and be happy. Nobody knows how will be tomorrow or the future.) Catullus, carmina, 5 Viuamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus / ... / Nobis cum semel occidit breuis lux, / Nox est perpetua una dormienda. (transl.: Let us live and love, my Lesbia [...] when our short light has set, we have to sleep a never ending night.) Whereas other units are working on Greek, Latin, and Italian texts, the ILC-CNR unit of the project currently has in charge the semantic annotation of a small part of the Greek and of all the Arabic texts and it is developing computational tools to assist the manual annotation, in order to suggest the most suitable tags that identify themes and motifs. The semantic annotation of literary and historical texts in collaborative environments is a relevant topic in the age of the Semantic Web. At least two approaches are possible: a top-down approach, in which an ontology or a predefined taxonomy is used for the annotation, and a bottomup approach, in which the text can be annotated with unstructured tags that will be organized in a second stage of the work. By combining these approaches, it is possible to collect more evidence to establish agreement on the annotated texts.","In conclusion, we have presented a work in progress related to the lexico-semantic instru-ments under development at the ILC-CNR to as-sist the annotators that collaborate to the Memo-rata Poetis Project.",5,Latin Resources

In line with cur- rent approaches, we propose here a new an- notation scheme specifically conceived to identify the typologies of changes an original sentence undergoes when it is manually sim- plified. Such a scheme has been tested on a parallel corpus available for Italian, which we have first aligned at sentence level and then annotated with simplification rules.","Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) as a field of research in NLP is receiving growing attention over the last few years due to the implications it has for both machine- and human-oriented tasks. For what concerns the former, ATS has been employed as a pre-processing step, which pro- vides an input that is easier to be analyzed by NLP modules, so that to improve the efficiency of, e.g., parsing, machine translation and infor- mation extraction. For what concerns the latter, ATS can also play a crucial role in educational and assistive technologies; e.g., it is used for the creation of texts adapted to the needs of particular readers, like children (De Belder and Moens, 2010), L2 learners (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007), people with low literacy skills (Aluìsio et al., 2008), cognitive disabilities (Bott and Saggion, 2014) or language impairments, such as aphasia (Carroll et al., 1998) or deafness (Inui et al., 2003). From the methodological point of view, while the first attempts were mainly developed on a set of predefined rules based on linguistic intuitions (Chandrasekar et al., 1996; Siddharthan, 2002), current ones are much more prone to adopt datadriven approaches. Within the latter paradigm, the availability of monolingual parallel corpora (i.e. corpora of authentic texts and their manually simplified versions) turned out to be a necessary prerequisite, as they allow for investigating the actual editing operations human experts perform on a text in the attempt to make it more comprehensible for their target readership. This is the case of Brouwers et al. (2014) for French; Bott and Saggion (2014) for Spanish; Klerke and Søgaard (2012) for Danish and Caseli et al. (2009) for Brazilian Portuguese. To our knowledge, only a parallel corpus exists for Italian which was developed within the EU project Terence, aimed at the creation of suitable reading materials for poor comprehenders (both hearing and deaf, aged 7-11)1. An excerpt of this corpus was used for testing purposes by Barlacchi and Tonelli (2013), who devised the first rule-based system for ATS in Italian focusing on a limited set of linguistic structures. The approach proposed in this paper is inspired to the recent work of Bott and Saggion (2014) for Spanish and differs from the work of Barlacchi and Tonelli (2013) since it aims at learning from a parallel corpus the variety of text adaptations that characterize manual simplification. In particular, we focus on the design and development of a new annotation scheme for the Italian language intended to cover a wide set of linguistic phenomena implied in text simplification.","We have illustrated the first annotation scheme for Italian that includes a wide set of simplification rules spanning across different levels of linguistic description. The scheme was used to annotate the only existing Italian parallel corpus. We believe such a resource will give valuable insights into human text simplification and create the prerequisites for automatic text simplification. Current developments are devoted to refine the annotation scheme, on the basis of a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the annotation results; we are also testing the suitability of the annotation scheme with respect to other corpora we are also gathering in a parallel fashion. Based on the statistical findings on the productivity of each rule, we will investigate whether and in which way certain combinations of rules affect the distribution of multi-leveled linguistic features between the original and the simplified texts. In addition, we intend to explore the relation between text simplification and a related task, i.e. readability assessment, with the aim of comparing the effects of such combinations of rules on the readability scores.",11,Text Simplification

Also, we will illustrate the latest work of alignment with MultiWordNet, to illustrate the method-ologies that have been experimented with, to share some preliminary result, and to highlight some remarkable findings about the semantic coverage of the two re-sources.","Senso Comune1 is an open, machine-readable knowledge base of the Italian language. The lex-ical content has been extracted from a monolin-gual Italian dictionary2, and is continuously en-riched through a collaborative online platform. The knowledge base is freely distributed. Senso Comune linguistic knowledge consists in a struc-tured lexicographic model, where senses can be qualified with respect to a small set of ontologi-cal categories. Senso Comune’s senses can be fur-ther enriched in many ways and mapped to other dictionaries, such as the Italian version of Mul-tiWordnet, thus qualifying as a linguistic Linked Open Data resource. 1.1 General principles The Senso Comune initiative embraces a num-ber of basic principles. First of all, in the era of user generated content, lexicography should be able to build on the direct witness of native speak-ers. Thus, the project views at linguistic knowl-edge acquisition in a way that goes beyond the ex-ploitation of textual sources. Another important assumption is about the relationship between lan-guage and ontology (sec. 2.1). The correspon-dence between linguistic meanings, as they are listed in dictionaries, and ontological categories, is not direct (if any), but rather tangential. Lin-guistic senses commit to the existence of various kinds of entities, but should not be in general con-fused with (and collapsed to) logical predicates directly interpretable on these entities. Finally, we believe that, like the language itself, linguistic knowledge should be owned by the entire commu-nity of speakers, thus they are committed to keep the resource open and fully available.","In this paper, we have introduced Senso Comune as an open cooperative knowledge base of Italian language, and discussed the issue of its alignment with other linguistic resources, such as WordNet. Experiments of automatic and manual alignment with the Italian MultiWordNet have shown that the gap between a native Italian dictionary and a WordNet-based linguistic resource may be rele-vant, both in terms of coverage and granularity. While this finding is in line with classic semiology (e.g. De Saussure’s principle of arbitrariness), it suggests that more attention should be paid to the semantic peculiarity of each language, i.e. the specific way each language constructs a concep-tual view of the World. One of the major features of Senso Comune is the way linguistic senses and ontological concepts are put into relation. Instead of equalising senses to concepts, a formal relation of ontological commitment is adopted, which weakens the ontological import of the lexicon. Part of our future research will be dedicated to leverage on this as an enabling feature for the integration of different lexical resources, both across and within national languages.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

This represents the first step towards the creation of a re-source for the analysis of ARs in speech and the development of automatic extrac-tion systems. Despite its relevance for speech recognition systems and spoken language understanding, the relation hold-ing between quotations and opinions and their source has been studied and extracted only in written corpora, characterized by a formal register (news, literature, scientific articles). The shift to the informal register and to a spoken corpus widens our view of this relation and poses new challenges. Our hypothesis is that the decreased relia-bility of the linguistic cues found for writ-ten corpora in the fragmented structure of speech could be overcome by including prosodic clues in the system. The analysis of SARC confirms the hypothesis show-ing the crucial role played by the acous-tic level in providing the missing lexical clues.","1 Introduction Our everyday conversations are populated by other people’s words, thoughts and opinions. Detect-ing quotations in speech represents the key to “one of the most widespread and fundamental topics of human speech” (Bakhtin, 1981, p. 337). A system able to automatically extract a quo-tation and attribute it to its truthful author from speech would be crucial for many applications. Besides Information Extraction systems aimed at processing spoken documents, it could be useful for Speaker Identification systems, (e.g. the strat-egy of emulating the voice of the reported speaker in quotations could be misunderstood by the sys-tem as a change of speaker). Furthermore, attri-bution extraction could also improve the perfor-mance of Dialogue parsing, Named-Entity Recog-nition and Speech Synthesis tools. On a more ba-sic level, recognizing citations from speech could be useful for sentence boundaries automatic detec-tion systems, where quotations, being sentences embedded in other sentences, could be a source of confusion. So far, however, attribution extraction systems have been developed only for written corpora. Extracting the text span corresponding to quotations and opinions and ascribing it to their proper source within a text means to reconstruct the Attribution Relations (ARs, henceforth) holding between three constitutive elements (following Pareti (2012)): the Source the Cue, i.e. the lexical anchor of the AR (e.g. say, announce, idea) the Content (1) This morning [Source John] [Cue told] me: [Content ”It’s important to support our leader. I trust him.”]. In the past few years ARs extraction has attracted growing attention in NLP for its many potential applications (e.g.Information Extraction, Opinion Mining) while remaining an open challenge. Automatically identifying ARs from a text is a complex task, in particular due to the wide range of syntactic structures that the relation can assume and the lack of a dedicated encoding in the language. While the content boundaries of a direct quotation are explicitly marked by quotation markers, opinions and indirect quotations only partially have syntactically, albeit blurred, boundaries as they can span intersententially. The subtask of identifying the presence of an AR could be tackled with more success by exploiting the presence of the cue as a lexical anchor establishing the links to source and content spans. For this reason, cues are the starting point or a fundamental feature of extraction systems (Pareti et al., 2013; Sarmento and Nunes, 2009; Krestel, 2007). In our previous work (Pareti and Prodanof, 2010; Pareti, 2012), starting from a flexible and comprehensive definition (Pareti and Prodanof, 2010, p. 3566) of AR, we created an annotation scheme which has been used to build the first large annotated resource for attribution, the Penn Attribution Relations Corpus (PARC)1, a corpus of news articles. In order to address the issue of detecting ARs in speech, we started from the theoretical and annotation framework from PARC to create a comparable resource. Section 2 explains the issues connected with extracting ARs from speech. Section 3 describes the Speech Attribution Relations Corpus (SARC, henceforth) and its annotation scheme. The analysis of the corpus is presented in Section 4. Section 5 reports an example of how prosodic cues can be crucial to identify ARs in speech. Finally, Section 6 draws on the conclusions and discusses future work.","6 Conclusions and future work The analysis of SARC, the first resource devel-oped to study ARs in speech, has helped to high-light a major problem of detecting attribution in a spoken corpus: the decreased reliability of the lexical cues crucial in previous approaches (com-pletely useless in at least 10% of the cases) and the consequential need to find reliable prosodic clues to integrate them. The example provided in Section 5 has showed how the integration of the acoustic cues could be useful to improve the accu-racy of attribution detection in speech. As a future project we are going to perform a large acoustic analysis of the ARs found in SARC, in order to see if some reliable prosodic cues can in fact be found and used in order to develop a software able to extract attribution from speech.",13,Multimodal

Professional translators perceive the ability of self-mathic systems to adapt to their style and corrections as crucial. In this article I proposed a scheme of adaptation of automatic translation sides to a specific document based on a limited amount of text, manually corrected, equal to that produced daily by a single translator.","Despite the significant and continued progress, the automatic translation (TA) is not yet able to generate text suitable for publication without human intervention. On the other hand, many studies have confirmed that in the context of assisted translation the correction of translated texts automatically enables an increase in the productivity of professional translators (see paragraph 2). This application of the TA is as more effective as greater and the integration of the automatic translation system into the entire translation process, which can be achieved by specializing the system both to the specific text to be translated and to the characteristics of the specific translator and its corrections. In the translation industry, the typical scenario is that of one or more translators who work for a few days on a given translation project, or on a set of homogeneous documents. After a working day, the information contained in the newly translated texts and the corrections made by the translators can be entered into the automatic system with the aim of improving the quality of the automatic translations proposed the next day. We will call this process adaptation to the project. The adaptation to the project can be repeated daily until the end of the work, so that all the information that implicitly translators put at the disposal of the system can be best exploited. This article presents one of the results of the European MateCat project,1 in which we have developed a web-based assisted translation system that integrates a TA module that is self-adjusted to the specific project. The validation experiments we will illustrate have been conducted on four languages, from English to Italian (IT), French (FR), Spanish (ES) and German (DE), and in two fields, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Legal (LGL). Ideally, the proposed adaptation methods should be evaluated by measuring the profit in terms of productivity on real translation projects. Therefore, as far as possible, we have conducted assessments on the field where professional translators have corrected the hypothesized translations by automatic, adjusted and non-adjusted systems. The adjustment was carried out on the basis of a part of the project translated during a preliminary phase, in which the same translator was asked to correct the translations provided by an unadjusted starting system. Since field assessments are extremely expensive, they cannot be performed frequently to compare all possible variants of algorithms and processes. We also conducted laboratory assessments, where the corrections of translators were simulated by reference translations. In general, in the legal field the improvements observed in the laboratory anticipated those measured in the field. On the contrary, the results in the ICT domain were controversial due to the little correspondence between the texts used for adaptation and those actually translated during the experiment.","A current research topic for the assisted translation industry is how to do-to automatic translation systems of the layer-city of self-adaptation. In this work I have presented a scheme of self-adaptation and the results of its validation not only in lab outlets but also on the field, with coin-wishing of professional translators, thanks to the collaboration with the industrial partner of MateCat. The experimental results confirmed the impact of our proposal, with gauge-day productivity up to 43%. However, the me-all works only if the texts used as the basis for the selection of specific data on which to perform the a-date is representative of the document you want to translate. In fact, if such a condition was not verified, as it was in our English-French/ICT experiments, the adapted models may be unable to improve the starting ones; in any case even in these critical conditions we have noticed any deterioration of performance, demonstrating the conservative behavior of our scheme.",10,Machine Translation

The paper offers an overview of the objectives of the work, its main features and most relevant lin-guistic and computational applications.","1 Introduction Core dictionaries are precious resources that rep-resent the most widely known (in production and reception) lexemes of a language. Among the most significant features characterizing basic vocabulary of a language is the high textual cov-erage of a small number of lexemes (ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 top ranking words in fre-quency lists), their large polysemy, their relation-ship to the oldest lexical heritage of a language, their relevance in fist and second language learn-ing and teaching and as reference tools for lexi-cal analysis. Many recent corpus based works have been produced to provide up-to-date core dictionaries to many European languages (e.g. the Routledge frequency dictionary series). Italian language has a number reference frequency lists all of which are related to corpora and collections of texts dating 1994 or earlier (among the most relevant Bortolini et al., 1971; Juilland and Traversa, 1973; De Mauro et al., 1993; Bertinetto et al. 2005). The Basic Vocabulary of Italian (VdB, De Mauro, 1980) first appeared as an annex to Guida all’uso delle parole and has been subsequently included in all lexicographic works directed by Tullio De Mauro, with some minor changes. VdB has benefited from a combination of statistical criteria for the selection of lemmas (both grammatical and content words) mainly based on a frequency list of written Italian, LIF (Bortolini et al., 1972) and later on a frequency list of spoken Italian, LIP (De Mauro et al., 1993) – and independent evaluations further submitted to experimentation on primary school pupils. The last version of VdB was published in 2007 in an additional tome of GRADIT (De Mauro, 1999) and counts about 6,700 lemmas, organised in three vocabulary ranges. Fundamental vocabulary (FO) includes the highest frequency words that cover about 90% of all written and spoken text occurrences [appartamento ‘apartment’, commercio ‘commerce’, cosa ‘thing’, fiore ‘flower’, improvviso ‘sudden’, incontro ‘meeting’, malato ‘ill’, odiare ‘to hate’], while high usage vocabulary (AU) covers about 6% of the subsequent high frequency words [acciaio ‘steel’, concerto ‘concert’, fase ‘phase’, formica ‘ant’, inaugurazione ‘inauguration’, indovinare ‘to guess’, parroco ‘parish priest’, pettinare ‘to comb’]. On the contrary high availability (AD) vocabulary is not based on textual statistical resources but is derived from a psycholinguistic insight experimentally verified, and is to be intended in the tradition of the vocabulaire de haute disponibilité, first introduced in the Français fondamentale project (Michéa, 1953; Gougenheim, 1964). VdB thus integrates high frequency vocabulary ranges with the socalled high availability vocabulary (haute disponibilité) and thus provides a full picture of not only written and spoken usages, but also purely mental usages of word (commonly regarding words having a specific relationship with the concreteness of ordinary life) [abbaiare to ‘bark’, ago ‘needle’, forchetta ‘fork’, mancino ‘left-handed’, pala ‘shovel’, pescatore ‘fisherman’]. From the first edition of VdB many things have changed in Italian society and language: Italian language was then used only by 50% of the population. Today Italian is used by 95% of the population. Many things have changed in the conditions of use of the language for the speakers and the relationship between Italian language and dialects have been deeply transformed. The renovated version of VdB, NVdB (Chiari and De Mauro, in press), will be presented and previewed in this paper. NVdB is a linguistic resource designed to meet three different purposes: a linguistic one, to be intended in both a theoretical and a descriptive sense, an educationallinguistic one and a regulative one, for the development of guidelines in public communication. The educational objective is focused on providing a resource to develop tools for language teaching and learning, both for first and second language learners. The descriptive lexicological objective is providing a lexical resource that can be used as a reference in evaluating behaviour of lexemes belonging to different text typologies, taking into account the behaviour of different lexemes both from an empirical-corpus based approach and an experimental (intuition based) approach and enable the description of linguistic changes that affected most commonly known words in Italian from the Fifties up to today. The descriptive objective is tightly connected to the possible computational applications of the resource in tools able to process general language and take into account its peculiar behaviour. The regulative objective regards the use of VdB as a reference for the editing of administrative texts, and in general, for easy reading texts.","4 Conclusion and future developments The NVdB of Italian is be distributed as a fre-quency dictionary of lemmatized lexemes and multiword, with data on coverage, frequency, dispersion, usage labels, grammatical qualifica-tions in all subcorpora. A linguistic analysis and comparison with previous data is also provided with full methodological documentation. The core dictionary and data are also distribut-ed electronically in various formats in order to be used as a reference tool for different applications. Future work will be to integrate data from the core dictionary with new lexicographic entries (glosses, examples, collocations) in order to pro-vide a tool useful both for first and second lan-guage learners and for further computational ap-plications.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Cryptocurrency is confirmed by the easy experiment of transferring a tweet containing hashtags and accounts out of the Twitter environment, where the failure to integrate the forms is immediately perceived and the process of reading and understanding is also substantially purchased. This difficulty, encountered by the neofite of the medium, appears in fact overcomeable with practice, while some special features of the post-sono hashtag cause problems with regard to the formal, or automatic decades of texts. This contribution aims to provide a description of the language properties of the hashtag, which is the most peculiar te-stual element of Twitter (Chiusaroli, 2014), with part-lare regarding the expressions in Italian.

The investigation path sees the hashtag come back to the definition of Short Writings as it is elaborated in Chiusaroli and Zanzotto 2012a and 2012b and now in www.scritturebrevi.it: It is the label Short Writings is proposed as a conceptual and metallingual category for the classification of graphic forms such as abbreviations, acronyms, signs, icons, indices and symbols, figurative elements, text expressions and visual codes for which it results in directing the principle of √îbrevity‚Äô connected to the criterion of the Oeconomy‚Äô. In particular, all the graphic manifestations that, in the syntagmatic dimension, subordinate to the principle of linearity of the meaning, alter the conventional morphotatic rules of the written language, and intervene in the construction of the message in the terms of Oriduction, content, synthesis‚Äô inducted by the supporters and contexts. The category is applied in synchronic and linguistic diacronic, in standard and non-standard systems, in general and specialized areas.√ì The analysis will also take place of the Twitter experience maturated with accounts @FChiusaroli and hashtag #scritturebrevi (from December 26, 2012) and other related hashtags (now elaborated and/or discussed at www.scritturebrevi.it).","The need to consider the elements with hashtags for their value both formal and semantic confirms itself indispensable for a proper assessment of language products (Cann, 1993, and, for the basis, Fillmore, 1976; Lyons, 1977; Church and McConnell Ginet, 1990), in particular, but not only, to be able to judge the real and concrete impact of the phenomenon of the writing of the network on the forms and uses, even in the wider perspective of the diacronic change (Simone, 1993). Where the hashtag is an important isolated element and as such a ability to gather content and ideas, it appears incomplete any analysis that does not take into account the belonging of the hashtag to multiple categories of the language, from the common name simple or composite, to its own, simple or composite, to the symmetic and phrasal connection, with natural consequences of morphosynthetic treatment (Grossmann, 2004; Doleschal and Thornton, 2000; Recanati, 2011). An appropriate analysis can also not be deprived of a semantic classification in the hierarchical and taxonomic sense of voices (Cardona, 1980, 1985a, 1985b), i.e. taking into account the degrees of the relationships between the elements, the relationships of synonymous or of hyperonymous and hyponymous (Basile, 2005 and Jezek, 2005), and also the only formal, homographic and homonymous relationships (Pazienza, 1999; Nakagawa and Mori, 2003; Pazienza and Pennacchiotti and Zanzotto, 2005), and finally the references in terms of correspondence in other languages (Smadja, McKeown and Hatzivassiloglou, 1996), in particular the English, for its role of network driver (Crystal, 2003). If it is true that the network and knowledge in the network are formed according to procedures not more linear or monodimensional, but"" with progress in depth and by layers (Eco, 2007), it seems indispensable to insert in the horizon of analysis, in addition to the formal, numerical and quantitative element, also the assessment of the semantic and prototipic structure through the reconstruction of the minimum elements or √àprimi√ì of knowledge, a method well-known in the history of linguistics with the term de reductio (Chiusaroli, 1998 and 2001), which for other things puts itself at the origin of the algorithm of the search engine (Eco, 1993). The web structure and the internal organization of the CMC enable us to use the Twitter hashtag as an emblematic case study to test the effectiveness of a method that combines the consideration of the functional power of the graphic string with the relevance of the semantic content plan: a intersection of different factors that must be mutually dependent for the correct verification of the data; an integrated theory of (web-)knowledge based on writing (Ong, 2002).",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We pro- pose an annotation model based on the situated theories of emotions. The anno- tation scheme is directed to ob-serve the natural unfolding of empathy during the conversations. The key component of the protocol is the identification of the anno- tation unit based both on linguistic and paralinguistic cues. In the last part of the paper we evaluate the reliability of the annotation model.,"The work we present is part of a research project aiming to provide scientific evidence for the sit- uated nature of emotional processes. In particular we investigate the case of complex social emo- tions, like empathy, by seeing them as relational events that are recognized by observers on the basis of their unfolding in human interactions. The ultimate goals of our research project are a) understanding the multidimensional signals of empathy in human conversations, and b) generat- ing a computational model of basic and complex emotions. A fundamental requirement for build- ing such computational systems is the reliability of the annotation model adopted for coding real life conversations. Therefore, in this paper, we will focus on the annotation scheme that we are using in our project by illustrating the case of empathy annotation. Empathy is often defined by metaphors that evoke the emotional or intellectual ability to identify another person’s emotional states, and/or to understand states of mind of the others. The word “empathy” was introduced in the psychological literature by Titchener in 1909 for translating the German term “Einfühlung”. Nowadays it is a common held opinion that empathy encompasses several human interaction abilities. The concept of empathy has been deeply investigated by cognitive scientists and neuroscientists, who proposed the hypothesis according to which empathy underpins the social competence of reconstructing the psychic processes of another person on the basis of the possible identification with his/her internal world and actions (Sperber & Wilson, 2002; Gallese, 2003). Despite the wide use of the notion of empathy in the psychological research, the concept is still vague and difficult to measure. Among psychologists there is little consensus about which signals subjects rely on for recognizing and echoing empathic responses. Also the uses of the concept by the computational attempts to repro-duce empathic behavior in virtual agents seem to be suffering due to the lack of operational definitions. Since the goal of our research is addressing the problem of automatic recognition of emotions in real life situations, we need an operational model of complex emotions, including empathy, focused on the unfolding of the emotional events. Our contribution to the design of such a model assumes that processing the discriminative characteristics of acoustic, linguistic, and psycholinguistic levels of the signals can support the automatic recognition of empathy in situated human conversations. The paper is organized as follows: in the next Section we introduce the situated model of emotions underlying our approach, and its possible impact on emotion annotation tasks. In Section 3 we describe our annotation model, its empirical bases, and reliability evaluation. Finally, we discuss the results of lexical features analysis and ranking",In this paper we propose a protocol for annotat- ing complex social emotions in real-life conver- sations by illustrating the special case of empa- thy. The definition of our annotation scheme is empirically-driven and compatible with the situ- ated models of emotions. The difficult goal of annotating the unfolding of the emotional pro- cesses in conversations has been approached by capturing the transitions between neutral and emotionally connoted speech events as those transitions manifest themselves in the melodic variations of the speech signals.,6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Results are compared with those obtained from a previous experiment performed only on Italian data. Differences between the two evaluation strategies, as well as between the quality of the mappings for the two languages considered in this paper, are dis-cussed.","In lexicography, the meaning of words is repre-sented through words: definitions in dictionaries try to make clear the denotation of lemmas, report-ing examples of linguistic usages that are funda-mental especially for function words like preposi-tions. Corpus linguistics derives definitions from a huge amount of data. This operation improves words meaning induction and refinements, but still supports the view that words can be defined by words. In the last 20 years dictionaries and lexicographic resources such as WordNet have been enriched with multimodal content (e.g. illustrations, pic-tures, animations, videos, audio files). Visual representations of denotative words like concrete nouns are effective: see for example the ImageNet project, that enriches WordNets glosses with pic-tures taken from the web. Conveying the meaning of action verbs with static representations is not possible; for such cases the use of animations and videos has been proposed (Lew 2010). Short videos depicting basic actions can support the users need (especially in second language acquisition) to understand the range of applicability of verbs. In this paper we describe the multimodal enrichment of Ital- WordNet and WordNet 3.0 action verbs entries by means of an automatic mapping with ImagAct (www.imagact.it), a conceptual ontology of action types instantiated by video scenes (Moneglia et al. 2012). Through the connection between synsets and videos we want to illustrate the meaning described by glosses, specifying when the video represents a more specific or a more generic action with respect to the one described by the gloss. We evaluate the mapping watching videos and then finding out which, among the synsets related to the video, is the best to describe the action performed.","Mutual enrichments of lexical resources is convenient, especially when different kinds of information are available. In this paper we describe the mapping between ImagAct videos representing action verbs’ meanings and Word- Net/ItalWordNet, in order to enrich the glosses multimodally. Two types of evaluation have been performed, one based on a gold standard that establishes correspondences between ImagActs basic action types and ItalWordNets synsets (Bartolini at al. 2014) and the other one based on the suitability of a synsets gloss to describe the action watched in the videos. The second type of evaluation suggests that for Italian the automatic mapping is effective in projecting the videos on Ital- WordNet’s glosses. For what regards the mapping for English, as future work we plan to change the settings, in order to test if the number of synonyms available in WordNet has a negative impact on the quality of the mapping.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

It allows specific researches on phono- ological and morphophonological phenomena of non-standard Latin forms with crucial ref- erence to the typology of the text, its origin and chronological collocation. This paper presents the first macrosection of CLaSSES, focused on the inscriptions from the archaic- early period.","Available digital resources for Latin epigraphy include some important databases. The Clauss- Slaby database (http://www.manfredclauss.de/gb/index.html) records almost all Latin inscriptions (by now 696.313 sets of data for 463.566 inscriptions from over 2.480 publications), including also some pictures. It can be searched by records, province, place and specific terms, thus provid- ing users with quantitative information. The Epi- graphic Database Roma EDR (http://www.edr- edr.it/English/index_en.php) is part of the international federation of Epigraphic Databases called Elec- tronic Archive of Greek and Latin Epigraphy (EAGLE). It is possible to look through EDR both as a single database or together with its partner databases accessing EAGLE’s portal (www.eagle-eagle.it). 1 Although they collect a large amount of data, these resources cannot provide linguists with rich qualitative and quantitative linguistic information focused on specific phenomena. The need for a different kind of information automatically ex- tracted from epigraphic texts is particularly expressing when dealing with sociolinguistic is- sues. There is a current debate on whether inscriptions can provide direct evidence on actual linguistic variations occurring in Latin society or they cannot. As Herman (1985) points out, the debate on the linguistic representativity of inscriptions alternates between totally skeptical and too optimistic approaches. Following Herman (1970, 1978a, 1978b, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1990, 2000), we believe that epigraphic texts can be regarded as a fundamental source for studying variation phenomena, provided that one adopts a critical approach. Therefore, we cannot entirely agree with the skeptical view adopted by Adams (2013: 33-34), who denies the role of inscriptions as a source for sociolinguistic variation in the absence of evidence also from metalinguistic comments by grammarians and literary authors. That said, the current state-of-the-art digital resources for Latin epigraphic texts does not allow researchers to evaluate the relevance of inscriptions for a sociolinguistic study that would like to rely on direct evidence. Furthermore, it is worth noting that within the huge amount of epigraphic texts available for the Latin language not every inscription is equally significant for linguistic studies: e.g., many inscriptions are very short or fragmentary, others are manipulated or intentionally archaising. Obviously, a (socio) linguistic approach to epigraphic texts should take into account only linguistically significant texts.","CLaSSES is an epigraphic Latin corpus for quan- titative and qualitative sociolinguistic analyses on Latin inscriptions, that can be useful for both historical linguists and philologists. It is annotat- ed with linguistic and metalinguistic features which allow specific queries on different levels of non-standard Latin forms. We have here presented the first macrosection of CLaSSES, containing inscriptions from the archaic-early period. In the next future we will collect comparable sub-corpora for the Classical and the Imperial period. Moreover, data will be organized in a database available on the web.",5,Latin Resources

Our experiments are carried out with two techniques: on-line and multitask learning. The former is capable to learn and self-adapt to user feedback, and is suitable for situations in which training data is not available. The latter is capable to learn from data com-ing from multiple domains, which might considerably differ from the actual testing domain. Two focused experiments in such challenging conditions indicate the good potential of the two approaches.","Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine Translation (MT) is the task of estimating the quality of a translated sentence at run-time and without access to reference translations (Specia et al., 2009; Soricut and Echihabi, 2010; Bach et al., 2011; Specia, 2011; Mehdad et al., 2012; C. de Souza et al., 2013; C. de Souza et al., 2014a). As a quality indicator, in a typical QE setting, automatic systems have to predict either the time or the number of editing operations (e.g. in terms of HTER1) required to a human to transform the translation into a syntactically/semantically correct sentence. In recent years, QE gained increasing interest in the MT community as a possible way to: i) decide whether a given translation is good enough for publishing as is, ii) inform readers of the target language only whether or not they can rely on a translation, iii) filter out sentences that are not good enough for post-editing by professional translators, or iv) select the best translation among options from multiple MT and/or translation memory systems. So far, despite its many possible applications, QE research has been mainly conducted in controlled lab testing scenarios that disregard some of the possible challenges posed by real working conditions. Indeed, the large body of research resulting from three editions of the shared QE task organized within the yearlyWorkshop on Machine Translation (WMT – (Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bojar et al., 2013; Bojar et al., 2014)) has relied on simplistic assumptions that do not always hold in real life. These assumptions include the idea that the data available to train QE models is: i) large (WMT systems are usually trained over datasets of 800/1000 instances) and ii) representative (WMT training and test sets are always drawn from the same domain and are uniformly distributed).In order to investigate the difficulties of training a QE model in realistic scenarios where such conditions might not hold, in this paper we approach the task in situations where: i) training data is not available at all (x2), and ii) training instances come from different domains (x3). In these two situations, particularly challenging from the machine learning perspective, we investigate the potential of online and multitask learning methods (the former for dealing with the lack of data, and the latter to cope with data heterogeneity), comparing them with the batch methods currently used.","We investigated the problem of training reliable QE models in particularly challenging conditions from the learning perspective. Two focused experiments have been carried out by applying: i) online learning to cope with the lack of training data, and ii) multitask learning to cope with heterogeneous training data. The positive results of our experiments suggest that the two paradigms should be further explored (and possibly combined) to overcome the limitations of current methods and make QE applicable in real-world scenarios.",10,Machine Translation

The system can work on any type of poem and produces a set of parameters that are then used to compare poems with one another, of the same author or of different authors. In this paper, we will concentrate on the second module, which is a rule-based system to represent and analyze poetic devices. Evaluation of the system on the basis of a manually created dataset - including poets from Shakespeare's time down to T.S.Eliot and Sylvia Plath - has shown its high precision and accuracy approximating 90%.","In this paper we present SPARSAR1, a system for the automatic analysis of English and Italian poetry. The system can work on any type of poem and produces a set of parameters that are then used to compare poems with one another, of the same author or of different authors. The output can be visualized as a set of coloured boxes of different length and width and allows a direct comparison between poems and poets. In addition, parameters produced can be used to evaluate best similar candidate poems by different authors by means of Pearson's correlation coefficient. The system uses a modified version of VENSES, a semantically oriented NLP pipeline (Delmonte et al., 2005). It is accompanied by a module that works at sentence level and produces a whole set of analysis both at quantitative, syntactic and semantic level. The second module is a rulebased system that converts each poem into phonetic characters, it divides words into stressed/unstressed syllables and computes rhyming schemes at line and stanza level. To this end it uses grapheme to phoneme translations made available by different sources, amounting to some 500K entries, and include CMU dictionary, MRC Psycholinguistic Database, Celex Database, plus our own database made of some 20,000 entries. Out of vocabulary words are computed by means of a prosodic parser we implemented in a previous project (Bacalu & Delmonte, 1999a,b). The system has no limitation on type of poetic and rhetoric devices, however it is dependent on language: Italian line verse requires a certain number of beats and metric accents which are different from the ones contained in an English iambic pentameter. Rules implemented can demote or promote word-stress on a certain syllable depending on selected language, linelevel syllable length and contextual information. This includes knowledge about a word being part of a dependency structure either as dependent or as head. A peculiar feature of the system is the use of prosodic measures of syllable durations in msec, taken from a database created in a previous project(Bacalu & Delmonte, 1999a,b). We produce a theoretic prosodic measure for each line and stanza using mean durational values associated to stressed/ unstressed syllables. We call this index, ""prosodic-phonetic density index"", because it contains count of phones plus count of theoretic durations: the index is intended to characterize the real speakable and audible consistency of each line of the poem. A statistics is issued at different levels to evaluate distributional properties in terms of standard deviations, skewness and kurtosis. The final output of the system is a parameterized version of the poem which is then read aloud by a TTS system: parameters are generated taking into account all previous analysis including sentiment or affective analysis and discourse structure, with the aim to produce an expressive reading. This paper extends previous conference and demo work (SLATE, Essem, EACL), and concentrates on the second module which focuses on poetic rhythm. The paper is organized as follows: the following section 2 is devoted to present the main features of the prosodicphonetic system with some example; we then present a conclusion and future work.","We have done a manual evaluation by analysing a randomly chosen sample of 50 poems out of the 500 analysed by the system.

30_2014,2014,CLICIT2014130,Rodolfo Delmonte,A Reevaluation of Dependency Structure Evaluation,ENG,1,0,0,Università Ca' Foscari Venezia,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Venice,"In this paper we will develop the argument indirectly raised by the organizer of 2014 Dependency Parsing for Information Extraction task when they classify 19 relations out of 45 as those semantically relevant for the evaluation, and exclude the others which confirms our stance which considers the new paradigm of Dependency parsing evaluation favoured in comparison to the previous parsing scheme based mainly on constituent or phrase structure evaluation. We will also speak in favour of rule-based dependency parsing and against statistically based dependency parsers for reasons related to the role played by the SUBJect relation in Italian.","In this paper I will question the currently widely spread assumption that Dependency Structures (hence DS) are the most convenient syntactic representation, when compared to phrase or constituent structure. I will also claim that evaluation metrics applied to DS are somehow ""boasting"" its performance with respect to phrase structure (hence PS) representation, without a real advantage, or at least it has not yet been proven there is one. In fact, one first verification has been achieved by this year Evalita Campaign which has introduced a new way of evaluating Dependency Structures, called DS for Information Extraction - and we will comment on that below1. In the paper I will also argue that some features of current statistical dependency parsers speak against the use of such an approach to the parsing of languages like Italian which have a high percentage of non-canonical structures (hence NC). In particular I will focus on problems raised by the way in which SUBJect arguments are encoded. State of the art systems are using more and more dependency representations which have lately shown great resiliency, robustness, scalability and great adaptability for semantic enrichment and processing. However, by far the majority of systems available off the shelf don’t support a fully semantically consistent representation and lack Empty or Null Elements (see Cai et al. 2001)2. O.Rambow (2010) in his opinion paper on the relations between dependency and phrase structure representation has omitted to mention the most important feature that differentiates them. PS evaluation is done on the basis of Brackets, where each bracket contains at least one HEAD, but it may contain other Heads nested inside. Of course, it may also contain a certain number of minor categories which however don’t count for evaluation purposes. On the contrary, DS evaluation is done on the basis of head-dependent relations intervening between a pair of TOKENs. So on the one side, F-measure evaluates number of brackets which coincide with number of Heads; on the other side it evaluates number of TOKENS. Now, the difference in performance is clearly shown by percent accuracy obtained with PS evaluation which for Italian was contained in a range between 70% to 75% in Evalita 2007, and between 75% and 80% in Evalita 2009 – I don’t take into account 2011 results which are referred to only one participant. DS evaluation reached peaks of 95% for UAS and in between 84% and 91% for LAS evaluation. Since data were the same for the two campaigns, one wonders what makes one representation more successful than the other. Typically, constituent parsing is evaluated on the basis of constituents, which are made up of a head and an internal sequence of minor constituents dependent on the head. What is really important in the evaluation is the head of each constituent and the way in which PS are organized, and this corresponds to bracketing. On the contrary, DS are organized on the basis of a “word level grammar”, so that each TOKEN constributes to the overall evaluation, including punctuation (not always). Since minor categories are by far the great majority of the tokens making up a sentence – in Western languages, but no so in Chinese, for instance (see Yang & Xue, 2010)– the evaluation is basically made on the ability of the parser to connect minor categories to their heads. What speaks in favour of adopting DS is the clear advantage gained in the much richer number of labeled relations which intervene at word level, when compared to the number of constituent labels used to annotate PS relations3. It is worth while noting that DS is not only a much richer representation than PS, but it encompasses different levels of linguistic knowledge. For instance, punctuation may be used to indicate appositions, parentheticals, coordinated sets, elliptical material, subdivision of complex sentences into main and subordinate clause. The same applies to discourse markers which may be the ROOT of a sentence. These have all to be taken into account when computing DS but not with PS parsing.","In this paper I tried to highlight critical issues on the current way of evaluating DS which indirectly ""boasts"" the performance of the parsers when compared to phrase structure evaluation. I assume this is due to the inherent shortcoming of DS evaluation not considering semantically relevant grammatical relations as being more important than minor categories. Statistical dependency parsers may have more problems in encoding features of Italian Subject because of its multiple free representations. For this reasons, I argued in favour of rule-based dependency parsers and I presented in particular, one example from TULETUT, a deep parser of Italian.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

The study concerns the documents of the political programs published on a public forum by candidates to the University of Ca‚Äô Foscari ‚Äì Venice. The documents were analyzed by our system and a graduation was created on the basis of scores associated with eleven parameters. After the vote, we created the graduation and we discovered that the system had predicted the name of the real winner in advance. The results were published in a local newspaper.","The analysis begins with the idea that the style of a programming document is composed of quantitative elements at the word level, of elements derived from the frequent use of certain synthetic structures and from unquisitely semantic and pragmatic characteristics such as the use of words and concepts that inspire positivity. I conducted the analysis starting from the texts available on the web or received from the candidates, using a series of parameters that I created for the analysis of the political speech in the Italian newspapers during the last and last government crisis. The results are published in some work nationally and internationally that I have listed in a brief bibliography. The analysis uses classical quantitative data such as the types/tokens ratio and then introduces information derived from the GETARUNS system that makes a complete parsing of texts from a syntax, semantic and pragmatic point of view. The data listed in the tables are derived from the system output files. The system produces a file for each phrase, a comprehensive file for the semantic analysis of the text and a file with the verticalized version of the text analyzed where each word is accompanied by a synthetic-semanticapragmatic classification. The system consists of a parser to transition networks increased by subcategory information, which first builds the chunks and then cascades the structures to higher complex constituents up to that of phrase. This representation is translated to another view that works on islands, starting from each verbal complex, corresponding to the verbal constituent. The parser to islands identifies the predicated-argumental structure, including the additions on the basis of the information contained in a subcategory for Italian built in previous projects, containing approximately 50,000 verbal and objective entries at different levels of depth. It is also used a list of selection preferences for verbs, names and acts derived from Italian treebanks available and containing approximately 30,000 income. In Table 1, we report the data in absolute numbers.","If you want to do a comprehensive graduation, you can consider that each parameter may have a positive or negative value. If it is positive, the person with the greater amount will be attributed as a reward the value 5 and the others to scale a value below one point, up to the value 1. In the event that the parameter has a negative value, the candidate with the greater amount will receive the score below 1 and the others to scale a value above one point to 5. The overall graduation will then be shaped making the sum of all the individual points obtained. The attribution of polarity to each parameter follows linguistic and stylistic criteria, and is as follows: 1. NullSubject - positive: The major number of zero subjects indicates the will to create a very coherent text and not to overload the reference to the same entity with repeated or core reference forms. The two. Subjective Props ‚Äì negative: The majority of proposals that express a subjective content indicates the subject‚Äôs tendency to expose his own ideas in a non-objective way. and 3. Negative Props - negative: The major use of negative propositions, i.e. with the use of denial or negative warnings, is a stylistic trait that is not propositive but tends to contradict what said or done by others. and 4. Non-factive Props - negative: The use of non-factive propositions indicates the stylistic tendency to expose their own ideas using unrealistic verbal times and ways - conjunctive, conditional, future and indefinite times. 5 of 5. Props / Sents - negative: The ratio that indicates the number of propositions per phrase is considered negative to mean that the higher the greater is the complexity of the style. 6 of 6. Negative Ws - negative: The number of negative words used in proportion to the total number of words has a negative value. 7 of 7. Positive Ws - positive: The number of positive words used in proportion to the total number of words has a positive value. 8 of 8. Passive Diath - negative: The number of passive forms used is considered negative as dark the agent of the action described. 9 of 9. Token / Sents - negative: The number of tokens in relation to the expressed phrases is treated as a negative factor again in relation to the problem of the induced complexity. 10 of 10. Vr - Rw - negative: This measure considers vocabulary wealth based on the so-called RareWords, or the total number of Hapax/Dis/Tris Legomena in the Rank List.

The data also tells us that the Bugliesi program is in strong correlation with that of LiCalzi but not with that of the other candidates. Cardinaletti has written a program that uses a uncohered style, with a somewhat elaborate vocabulary, with quite more complex synthetic structures, expressing the contents in a much less concrete and much less fatal way, speaking to all levels of stakeholders, teachers and non- teachers.

32_2014,2014,CLICIT2014132,Marina Ermolaeva,An adaptable morphological parser for agglutinative languages,ENG,1,1,1,Moscow State University,1,1,1,1,Marina Ermolaeva,0,0,Russia,Moscow,The paper reports the state of the ongoing work on creating an adaptable morphological parser for various agglutinative languages. A hybrid approach involving methods typically used for non-agglutinative languages is proposed. We explain the design of a working prototype for inflectional nominal morphology and demonstrate its work with an implementation for Turkish language. An additional experiment of adapting the parser to Buryat (Mongolic family) is discussed.,"The most obvious way to perform morphological parsing is to make a list of all possible morphological variants of each word. This method has been successfully used for nonagglutinative languages, e.g. (Segalovich 2003) for Russian, Polish and English. Agglutinative languages pose a much more complex task, since the number of possible forms of a single word is theoretically infinite (Jurafsky and Martin 2000). Parsing languages like Turkish often involves designing complicated finite-state machines where each transition corresponds to a single affix (Hankamer 1986; Eryiğit and Adalı 2004; Çöltekin 2010; Sak et al. 2009; Sahin et al. 2013). While these systems can perform extremely well, a considerable redesigning of the whole system is required in order to implement a new language or to take care of a few more affixes. The proposed approach combines both methods mentioned above. A simple finite-state machine allows to split up the set of possible affixes, producing a finite and relatively small set of sequences that can be easily stored in a dictionary. Most systems created for parsing agglutinative languages, starting with (Hankamer 1986) and (Oflazer 1994), process words from left to right: first stem candidates are found in a lexicon, then the remaining part is analyzed. The system presented in this paper applies the right-to-left method (cf. (Eryiğit and Adalı 2004)): affixes are found in the first place. It can ultimately work without a lexicon, in which case the remaining part of the word is assumed to be the stem; to improve precision of parsing, it is possible to compare it to stems contained in a lexicon. A major advantage of right-to-left parsing is the ability to process words with unknown stems without additional computations. Multi-language systems (Akın and Akın 2007; Arkhangelskiy 2012) are a relatively new tendency. With the hybrid approach mentioned above, the proposed system fits within this trend. As the research is still in progress, the working prototype of the parser (written in Python language) is currently restricted to nominal inflectional morphology. Within this scope, it has been implemented for Turkish; an additional experiment with Buryat language is discussed in the section 5.","At the moment, the top-importance task is lifting the temporary limitations of the parser by implementing other parts of speech (finite and non-finite verb forms, pronouns, postpositions etc.) and derivational suffixes. Although the slot system described in 3.1 has been sufficient for both Turkish and Buryat, other agglutinative languages may require more flexibility. This can be achieved either by adding more slots (thus making the slot system nearly universal) or by providing a way to derive the slot system automatically, from plain text or a corpus of tagged texts; the latter solution would also considerably reduce the amount of work that has to be done manually. Another direction of future work involves integrating the parser into a more complex system. DIRETRA, an engine for Turkish-to-English direct translation, is being developed on the base of the parser. The primary goal is to provide a word-for-word translation of a given text, reflecting the morphological phenomena of the source language as precisely as possible. The gloss lines output by the parser are processed by the other modules of the system and ultimately transformed into text representations in the target language:Though the system is being designed for Turkish, the next step planned is to implement other Turkic languages as well.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis
33_2014,2014,CLICIT2014133,"Lorenzo Ferrone, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto",Distributed Smoothed Tree Kernel,ENG,2,0,0,Università di Roma Tor Vergata,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Rome,"In this paper we explore the possibility to merge the world of Compositional Distributional Semantic Models (CDSM) with Tree Kernels (TK). In particular, we will introduce a specific tree kernel (smoothed tree ker-nel, or STK) and then show that is possibile to approximate such kernel with the dot product of two vectors obtained compositionally from the sen-tences, creating in such a way a new CDSM.","Compositional distributional semantics is a flourishing research area that leverages dis-tributional semantics (see Baroni and Lenci (2010)) to produce meaning of simple phrases and full sentences (hereafter called text frag-ments). The aim is to scale up the success of word-level relatedness detection to longer fragments of text. Determining similarity or relatedness among sentences is useful for many applications, such as multi-document summar-ization, recognizing textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2013), and semantic textual similarity detection (Agirre et al., 2013; Jurgens et al., 2014). Compositional distributional semantics models (CDSMs) are functions mapping text fragments to vectors (or higher-order tensors). Functions for simple phrases directly map distributional vectors of words to distributional vectors for the phrases (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Zanzotto et al., 2010). Functions for full sentences are generally de ned as recursive functions over the ones for phrases (Socher et al., 2011). Distributional vectors for text fragments are then used as inner layers in neural networks, or to compute similarity among text fragments via dot product. CDSMs generally exploit structured representations tx of text fragments x to derive their meaning f(tx), but the structural information, although extremely important, is obfuscated in the nal vectors. Structure and meaning can interact in unexpected ways when computing cosine similarity (or dot product) between vectors of two text fragments, as shown for full additive models in (Ferrone and Zanzotto, 2013). Smoothed tree kernels (STK) (Croce et al., 2011) instead realize a clearer interaction between structural information and distributional meaning. STKs are speci c realizations of convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) where the similarity function is recursively (and, thus, compositionally) computed. Distributional vectors are used to represent word meaning in computing the similarity among nodes. STKs, however, are not considered part of the CDSMs family. As usual in kernel machines (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000), STKs directly compute the similarity between two text fragments x and y over their tree representations tx and ty, that is, STK(tx; ty). The function f that maps trees into vectors is only implicitly used, and, thus, STK(tx; ty) is not explicitly expressed as the dot product or the cosine between f(tx) and f(ty). Such a function f, which is the underlying reproducing function of the kernel (Aronszajn, 1950), is a CDSM since it maps trees to vectors by using distributional meaning. However, the huge nality of Rn (since it has to represent the set of all possible subtrees) prevents to actually compute the function f(t), which thus can only remain implicit. Distributed tree kernels (DTK) (Zanzotto and Dell'Arciprete, 2012) partially solve the last problem. DTKs approximate standard tree kernels (such as (Collins and Du y, 2002)) by de ning an explicit function DT that maps trees to vectors in Rm where m n and Rn is the explicit space for tree kernels. DTKs approximate standard tree kernels (TK), that is, hDT(tx);DT(ty)i TK(tx; ty), by approximating the corresponding reproducing function. Thus, these distributed trees are small vectors that encode structural information. In DTKs tree nodes u and v are represented by nearly orthonormal vectors, that is, vectors !u and !v such that h !u ; !v i ( !u ; !v ) where is the Kroneker's delta. This is in contrast with distributional semantics vectors where h !u ; !v i is allowed to be any value in [0; 1] according to the similarity between the words v and u. In this paper, leveraging on distributed trees, we present a novel class of CDSMs that encode both structure and distributional meaning: the distributed smoothed trees (DST). DSTs carry structure and distributional meaning on a rank-2 tensor (a matrix): one dimension encodes the structure and one dimension encodes the meaning. By using DSTs to compute the similarity among sentences with a generalized dot product (or cosine), we implicitly de ne the distributed smoothed tree kernels (DSTK) which approximate the corresponding STKs. We present two DSTs along with the two smoothed tree kernels (STKs) that they approximate. We experiment with our DSTs to show that their generalized dot products approximate STKs by directly comparing the produced similarities and by comparing their performances on two tasks: recognizing textual entailment (RTE) and semantic similarity detection (STS). Both experiments show that the dot product on DSTs approximates STKs and, thus, DSTs encode both structural and distributional semantics of text fragments in tractable rank-2 tensors. Experiments on STS and RTE show that distributional semantics encoded in DSTs increases performance over structure-only kernels. DSTs are the rst positive way of taking into account both structure and distributional meaning in CDSMs. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2.1 introduces the basic notation used in the paper. Section 2 describe our distributed smoothed trees as compositional distributional semantic models that can represent both structural and semantic information. Section 4 reports on the experiments. Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions.","Distributed Smoothed Trees (DST) are a novel class of Compositional Distributional Se-mantics Models (CDSM) that effectively en-code structural information and distributional semantics in tractable rank-2 tensors, as ex-periments show. The paper shows that DSTs contribute to close the gap between two appar-ently different approaches: CDSMs and convo-lution kernels. This contribute to start a dis-cussion on a deeper understanding of the rep-resentation power of structural information of existing CDSMs.",22,Distributional Semantics

 original algorithm.","The various different senses of polysemic words do not always stand to each other in the same way. Some senses group together along certain dimensions of meaning while others stand clearly apart. Machine readable dictionaries have in the past used coarse grained sense distinctions but often without any explicit indication as to whether these senses were related or not. Most significantly, few machine readable dictionaries explicitly encode systematic alternations. In Utt and Pad´o (2011) a methodology is described for deriving systematic alternations of senses from WordNet. In Frontini et al. (2014) the work was carried out for Italian using the PAROLE SIMPLE CLIPS lexicon (PSC) (Lenci et al., 2000), a lexical resource that contains a rich set of explicit lexical and semantic relations. The purpose of the latter work was to test the methodology of the former work against the inventory of regular polysemy relations already encoded in the PSC semantic layer. It is important to notice that this was not possible in the original experiment, as WordNet does not contain such information. The result of the work done on PSC shows how the original methodology can be useful in testing the consistency of encoded polysemies and in finding gaps in individual lexical entries. At the same time the methodology is not infallible especially in distinguishing type alternations that frequently occur in the lexicon due to systematic polysemy from other alternations that are produced by metaphoric extensions, derivation or other non systematic sense shifting phenomena. In this paper we shall briefly outline the problem of lexical ambiguity; then describe the procedure of type induction carried out in the previous experiments, discussing the most problematic results; finally we will propose a change in the original methodology that seems more promising in capturing the essence of systematic polysemy.","To conclude, such preliminary results actually seem to confirm the hypothesis that measuring the association strength between types, rather than the frequency of their cooccurrence, is useful to capture the systematicity of an alternation. In future work it may be interesting to test ranking by other association measures (such as Log Likelihood) and with different filternigs. Finally, the original experiment may be repeated on both Italian and English WordNets in order to evaluate the new method on the original lexical resource.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The statistical value-daction, articulated into three tests, is based on the calculation of the inter-tagger agreement in tasks of disambiguation of re-sented concepts using prototypes for images.","IMAGACT is an interlinguistic enthology that makes the spectrum of pragmatic variation-as associated with action predicates at average and high frequency in Italian and English (Moneglia et al., 2014). The classes of action that identify the reference entities of the language concepts, referred to in this lessical resource in the form of prototype scenes (Rosch, 1978), were in-docked by the body of spoken by madrelin-gua linguists, through a bottom-up procedure: the mate-rials linguistic were subjected to an arctic-lat procedure of notification described extensively in previous works (Moneglia et al., 2012; Frontini et al., 2012). The article illustrates the results of three tests aimed at assessing the consistency of the categorization of the action space proposed by the noteers for a short but semanticly consistent set of resource verbes: such choice was determined by the will to study at a high level of detail the problems related to the typization of the variation of the preached on events. The predisposition of this case-study is also favorable to the creation of a standard procedure, extended in a second time to statistically significant portions of the oncology for its complete validation. Paragraph 2 shall present the statist coefficients adopted, and Paragraph 3 shall describe the methodology and results of the tests carried out.","It is notorious that semantic note tasks, and in particular those dedicated to verbal lessic (Fellbaum, 1998; Fellbaum et al., 2001), record low levels of I.TA.5 In this case the possibility of obtaining high values, even with non-expert noteers, is likely due to the exclusively action and physical nature of the classes used for the categorization. Following the validation it was possible to use the data in applications of a psycholinguistic type (Gagliardi, 2014): the sample of verbs of oncology, broad and at the same time formally controlled, if fully validated could represent an unprecedented source of semantic data for cognitive sciences.

Our approach borrows from techniques for spelling correction in context using a prob-abilistic edit-operation error model and lexical resources. We highlight conditions in which high error reduction rates can be obtained and where the approach currently stands with real data.","The OPATCH project (Open Platform for Access to and Analysis of Textual Documents of Cul-tural Heritage) aims at creating an advanced online search infrastructure for research in an historical newspapers archive. The search experience is en-hanced by allowing for dedicated searches on per-son and place names as well as in defined subsec-tions of the newspapers. For implementing this, OPATCH builds on computational linguistic (CL) methods for structural parsing, word class tagging and named entity recognition (Poesio et al., 2011). The newspaper archive contains ten newspapers in German language from the South Tyrolean region for the time period around the First World War. Dating between 1910 and 1920, the newspapers are typed in the blackletter Fraktur font and paper quality is derogated due to age. Unfortunately, such material is challenging for optical character recognition (OCR), the process of transcribing printed text into computer readable text, which is the first necessary pre-processing step for any further CL processing. Hence, in OPATCH we are starting from majorly error-prone OCR-ed text, in quantities that cannot realistically be corrected manually. In this paper we present attempts to automate the procedure for correcting faulty OCR-ed text.","The approach we presented to correct OCR er-rors considered four features of two types: edit-distance and n-grams frequencies. Results show that a simple scoring system can correct OCR-ed texts with very high accuracy under idealized con-ditions: no more than two edit operations and a perfect dictionary. Obviously, these conditions do not always hold in practice, thus an observed er-ror reduction rate drops to 10%. Nevertheless, we can expect to improve our dictionary coverage so that very noisy OCR-ed texts (i.e. 48% error with distance of at least three to target) can be corrected with accuracies up to 20%. OCR-ed texts with less challenging error patterns can be corrected with accuracies up to 61% (distance 2) and 86% (dis-tance 1).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The case of train announcements,ENG,3,0,0,"CNRS, Università di Torino, Libera Università di Bolzano",3,1,0,1,Carlo Geraci,0,0,"France, Italy","Paris, Turin, Bolzano",In this paper we present some linguistic issues of an automatic transla-tor from Italian to Italian Sign Language (LIS) and how we addressed them.,"Computational linguistic community showed a growing interest toward sign languages. Several projects of automatic translation into signed languages (SLs) recently started and avatar technology is becoming more and more popular as a tool for implementing automatic translation into SLs (Bangham et al. 2000, Zhao et al. 2000, Huenerfauth 2006, Morrissey et al. 2007, Su and Wu 2009). Current projects investigate relatively small domains in which avatars may perform decently, like post office announcements (Cox et al., 2002), weather forecasting (Verlinden et al., 2002), the jurisprudence of prayer (Almasoud and Al-Khalifa, 2011), driver’s license renewal (San-Segundo et al., 2012), and train announcements (e.g. Braffort et al. 2010, Ebling/Volk 2013). LIS4ALL is a project of automatic translation into LIS where we faced the domain of public transportation announcements. Specifically, we are developing a system of automatic translations of train station announcements from spoken Italian into LIS. The project is the prosecution of ATLAS, a project of automatic translation into LIS of weather forecasting (http://www.atlas. polito.it/index.php/en). In ATLAS two distinct approaches to automatic translation have been adopted, interlingua rule-based translation and statistical translation (Mazzei et al. 2013, Tiotto et al., 2010, Hutchins and Somer 1992). Both approaches have advantages and drawbacks in the specific context of automatic translation into SL. The statistical approach provides greater robustness while the symbolic approaches is more precise in the final results. A preliminary evaluation of the systems developed for ATLAS showed that both approaches have similar results. However, the symbolic approach we implemented produces the structure of the sentence in the target language. This information is used for the automatic allocation of the signs in the signing space for LIS (Mazzei et al. 2013), an aspect not yet implemented in current statistical approaches. LIS4ALL only uses the symbolic (rule-based) translation architecture to process the Italian input and generate the final LIS string. With respect to ATLAS, two main innovations characterize this project: new linguistic issues are addressed; the translation architecture is partially modified. As for the linguistic issues: we are enlarging the types of syntactic constructions covered by the avatar and we are increasing the electronic lexicon built for ATLAS (around 2350 signs) by adding new signs (around 120) specific to the railway domain. Indeed, this latter was one of the most challenging aspects of the project especially when the domain of train stations is addressed. Prima facie this issue would look like a special case of proper names, something that should be easily addressed by generating specific signs (basically one for every station). However, the solution is not as simple as it seems. Indeed, several problematic aspects are hidden when looking at the linguistic situation of names in LIS (and more generally in SL). As for the translation architecture, while in ATLAS a real interlingua translation with a deep parser and a FoL meaning representation were used, in LIS4ALL, we decided to employ a regular-expression-based analyzer that produces a simple (non recursive) filler/slot based semantic to parse the Italian input. This is so, because in the train announcement domain, input sentences have a large number of complex noun phrases with several prepositional phrases, resulting in a degraded parser performance (due to multiple attachment options). Moreover, the domain of application is extremely regular since the announcements are generated by predefined paths (RFI, 2011). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the linguistic issues, Section 3 discusses the technical issues while Section 4 concludes the paper.","In this paper we considered two issues related to the development of an automatic translator from Italian to LIS in the railway domain. These are: 1) some syntactic mismatches between input and target languages; and 2) how to deal with lexical gaps due to unknown train station names. The first issue emerged in the creation of a parallel Italian-LIS corpus: the specificity of the domain allowed us to use a naive parser based on regular expressions, a semantic interpreter based on filler/slot semantics, a small CCG in generation. The second issue has been addressed by blending written text into a special “sign”. In the next future we plan to quantitatively evaluate our translator.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Starting from the establishment of a dictionary of locations for Italian L2, ConParoleTue represents an attempt to re-incorporate problems typical of lessicographic processing (the quality and the record of definitions) towards a greater center of the communication needs of those who learn. For this purpose, a crowdsourcing-based methodology is used for the drafting of definitions. This article describes this methodology and presents a first assessment of its results: the definitions obtained through crowdsourcing are quantitatively relevant and qualitatively suitable for non-native Italian speakers.","ConParoleTue (2012) is an application experiment of crowdsourcing within the framework of L2 lessicography, developed within the APRIL Project (Spina, 2010b) of the University for Foreigners of Perugia during the creation of a dictionary of locations for Italian L2 apprentices. The locations have occupied a leading place for several decades in studies on the learning of a second language (Meunier and Granger, 2008). This location is recognized as a key competence for an apprenticeship, because it plays a key role in the two aspects of production (for example, it provides pre-built and ready-to-use lessical blocks, improving fluency; Schmitt, 2004) and understanding (Lewis, 2000). Also within the scope of Italian lessicography the research on locations has been productive, and has led, in the last five years, to the publication of at least three paper dictionaries of Italian locations: Urz"" (2009), born in the field of translation; Tiberii (2012) and Lo Cascio (2013). The DICI-A (Dizionario de las Colocaciones Italianas para Apprendentes; Spina, 2010a; 2010b) consists of the 11,400 Italian locations extracted from the Perugia Corpus, a reference corpus of Italian written and spoken contemporary1. Among the many proposals, the basic definition of the constitution of the DICI-A is that of Evert (2005), according to which a location is A word combination whose semantic and/or syntactic properties cannot be fully predicted from those of its components, and which therefore has to be listed in a lexicon√ì. The locations of the DICI-A belong to 9 different categories, selected on the basis of the most productive sequences of grammar categories that make up them: aggettive- name (tragic error), name-aggettive (the next year), name-name (weight form), verbo- (art.(a) name (to make a request/to make a penalty), name- preposition-name (credit card), aggettive- as-name (fresh like a rose), aggettive- conjunction-aggettive (healthy and safe), name-conjunction- name (card and pen), verboaggettive (cost expensive). For each location the Juilland index of dispersion and use (Bortolini et al., 1971) was calculated on the basis of the selected final location. The question is how to define them. In this context, the idea of the use of crowdsourcing, boring of ConParoleTue, was born.","The described experiment, which concerns crowdsourcing for the acquisition of Italian locations edited here, has proved effective both from the quantitative point of view (more than 3200 definitions five months) and from that of their appropriate thesis to a audience of learners to with definitions edited by a team of les grafi has highlighted the most intuitive and natural character of the definitions of non-specialists, despite the greater abstractness of the definitions of professionals. The results of the writings lead to continuing the writing of the dictionary through this crowdsourcing-based methodology.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

Interestingly, while SVMs are known to generally provide higher accu-racy than a perceptron, according to pre-vious work and theoretical findings, no re-cent paper currently describes the use of SVMstruct for coreference resolution. In this paper, we address this question by solving some technical problems at both theoretical and algorithmic level enabling the use of SVMs for coreference resolu-tion and other similar structured output tasks (e.g., based on clustering).","Coreference resolution (CR) is a complex task, in which document phrases (mentions) are partitioned into equivalence sets. It has recently been approached by applying learning algorithms operating in structured output spaces (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004). Considering the nature of the problem, i.e., the NP-hardness of finding optimal mention clusters, the task has been reformulated as a spanning graph problem. First, Yu and Joachims (2009) proposed to (i) represent all possible mention clusters with fully connected undirected graphs and (ii) infer document mention cluster sets by applying Kruskal’s spanning algorithm (Kruskal, 1956). Since the same clustering can be obtained from multiple spanning forests (there is no one-to-one correspondence), these latter are treated as hidden or latent variables. Therefore, an extension of the structural SVM – Latent SVMstruct (LSVM) – was designed to include these structures in the learning procedure. Later, Fernandes et al. (2012) presented their CR system having a resembling architecture. They do inference on a directed candidate graph using the algorithm of Edmonds (1967). This modeling coupled with the latent structured perceptron delivered state-of-the-art results in the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task (Pradhan et al., 2012). To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous work on a comparison of the two methods, and the LSVM approach of Yu and Joachims has not been applied to the CoNLL data. In our work, we aim, firstly, at evaluating LSVM with respect to the recent benchmark standards (corpus and evaluation metrics defined by the CoNLL-shared task) and, secondly, at understanding the differences and advantages of the two structured learning models. In a closer look at the LSVM implementation1, we found out that it is restricted to inference on a fully-connected graph. Thus, we provide an extension of the algorithm enabling to operate on an arbitrary graph: this is very important as all the best CR models exploit heuristics to prefilter edges of the CR graph. Therefore our modification of LSVM allows us to use it with powerful heuristics, which greatly contribute to the achievement of the state of the art. Regarding the comparison with the latent perceptron of Fernandes et al. (2012), the results of our experiments provide evidence that the latent trees derived by Edmonds’ spanning tree algorithm better capture the nature of CR. Therefore, we speculate that the use of this spanning tree algorithm within LSVM may produce higher results than those of the current perceptron algorithm.","We have performed a comparative analysis of the structured prediction frameworks for coref-erence resolution. Our experiments reveal that the graph modelling of Fernandes et al. and Ed-monds’ spanning algorithm seem to tackle the task more specifically. As a short-term future work, we intend to verify if LSVM benefits from us-ing Edmonds’ algorithm. We have also enabled the LSVM implementation to operate on partial graphs, which allows the framework to be com-bined with different filtering strategies and facili-tates its comparison with other systems.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Compare example (1), where wine is used in a mass context (as a bare singular; denoting a substance) to (2), where the use of the determiner three indicates a count usage, shifting its interpretation to types of wine. (1) I like wine. (2) Three wines grow in this region. The same phenomenon can also be observed for count nouns: in example (3), apple is used in its more frequent count sense, while its bare usage in example (4) constitutes a mass usage with a slightly changed meaning — the focus is not on individual, whole apples as in the countable example, but on their material/substance. (3) I bought five apples at the market. (4) There is apple in the salad. Data-based approaches to the mass/count phenomenon include Baldwin and Bond (2003), who classify nouns into five countability types based on lexico-syntactic features and Ryo Nagata et al. (2005), who use context words to distinguish between mass and count nouns. Katz and Zamparelli (2012) were the first to study mass/count elasticity using distributional semantic models. First of all, they dispelled the view that there is a clear count/mass dichotomy: like in the examples above, many nouns which appear frequently in count contexts also appear frequently in mass contexts. Hence, rather than making a binary distinction (count vs. mass nouns), we should speak of predominantly count (resp., predominantly mass) nouns, i.e., nouns which occur more frequently in count (resp. mass) contexts than in mass (resp., count) contexts. Moreover, Katz and Zamparelli (2012) take pluralisation as a proxy for count usage and conjecture that for predominantly count nouns the similarity between singular and plural is higher than for predominantly mass nouns since the latter undergo a shift whereas the former do not. This conjecture finds quantitative support in their data – the 2- billion word ukWaC corpus.1 We wonder whether other factors, such as polysemy, have an impact on this quantitative analysis and we further investigate nominal coercion by also considering the abstract vs. concrete dimension and polysemy. Katz and Zamparelli (2012) notice that while plurals are invariably count, singulars can be a mixture of mass and count usages, and propose to use syntactic contexts to disambiguate mass and count usages in future studies. We take up their suggestion and look at coercion using vector representations of mass vs. count usages. According to the linguistic literature (Pelletier (1975)), instances of coercion fall into several shift classes. In this view, coerced nouns move towards a particular “destination”: Container shift: Liquids (mass) are coerced into countable quantities contained in containers: “two beers, please!” Kind shift: Masses are coerced into a kind reading: “three wines grow in this region” Food shift: Animal nouns are coerced into a mass food meaning: “there was chicken in the salad” Universal grinder: Countables are coerced into a mass reading: “after the accident, there was dog all over the street” We wonder whether these shift classes can be identified in the semantic space. Thus, we propose a simple experiment in which we assess whether the count usage vectors of typical mass nouns move towards (=become more similar to) these suggested destinations. In sum, we address the following research questions: (1) Do nouns undergo noticeable shifts – and if so, what factors have an impact? (2) Can we interpret the destination of a shift in terms of standard shift classes?","We have seen how Distributional Semantics Models (DSMs) can be applied to investigate nominal coercion. DSMs can capture some aspects of mass/count noun meaning shifts, such as the fact that predominantly mass nouns undergo greater meaning shifts than predominantly count nouns when pluralised. We also find that abstractness and polysemy have an impact on singular-plural distance: abstract nouns and highly polysemous nouns have a greater singular-plural distance than concrete and monosemous nouns, respectively. Furthermore, our second experiment shows that coercion lies mainly in cases where both the mass and count usage vectors stay close to the averaged noun meaning. However, as our toy evaluation of clear cases of container and kind coercion shows, the direction of the shift can be differentiated based on usage vectors.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The paper briefly de-scribes the MIDIA corpus it focuses on the improvements to the contemporary Italian parameter file of the PoS tagging program Tree Tagger, made to adapt the software to the analysis of a textual basis characterized by strong morpho-syntactic and lexical variation; and, finally, it outlines the reasons and the advantages of the strategies adopted.","The realization of MIDIA, a balanced diachronic corpus of Italian, raised the issue of the elaboration of a strategy of analysis of texts from different genres and time periods in the history of Italian. This temporal and textual diversity involves both a marked graphic, morphological and lexical variation in word forms, and differences in the ordering of the PoS. The program chosen for the PoS tagging is Tree Tagger (cf. Schmid 1994, 1995), and the parameter file, made of a lexicon and a training corpus, is the one developed by Baroni et al (2004) for contemporary Italian. The strategy we developed for the adjustement of the PoS tagging to different diachronic varieties has been to greatly increase the lexicon with a large amount of word forms belonging predominantly to Old Italian, and not to retrain the program with texts belonging to previous temporal stages. This solution turned out to be economical and effective: it has allowed a significant improvement of the correct assignment of PoS for texts both old and modern, with a success rate equal to or greater than 95% for the tested texts, and an optimal use of human resources.",The strategy we devised to develop MIDIA PoS tagging for the analysis of texts belonging to different time periods and textual genres than that for which it was originally trained has proved to be successful and economical. Human resources have been concentrated on enriching the lexicon and on the review of automatic lexeme and PoS assignment. Our results show that a larger lexicon improves the analysis also for words adjacent to those recognized by the matching with the word forms listed in the lexicon. This has some interesting consequences both on the strategies for text tagging and on the implementation of the program Tree Tagger for the analysis of texts with a great range of variation. We plan to further enrich MIDIA lexicon by adding word forms from the corpus not yet listed in the lexicon.,7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We show through a distributional and lexico-syntactic pattern-based corpus analysis that the variability of copredica-tion contexts is the key to distinguish com-plex types nouns from nouns subject to co-ercion.","Copredication can be defined as a “grammatical construction in which two predicates jointly apply to the same argument” (Asher 2011, 11). We focus here on copredications in which the two predicates select for incompatible types. An example is (1): (1) Lunch was delicious but took forever. where one predicate (‘take forever’) selects for the event sense of the argument lunch while the other (‘delicious’) selects for the food sense. Polysemous expressions entering such copredication contexts are generally assumed to have a complex type (Pustejovsky 1995), that is, to lexically refer to entities “made up” of two (or more) components of a single type; it is thus assumed for example that lunch is of the complex type event food.1 Copredication as a defining criterion for linguistic expressions referring to complex types is, however, problematic, because copredication is possible, albeit less frequent, also with expressions which exhibit polysemy because of coercion, as in the case of the noun sandwich in such contexts as (2): (2) Sam grabbed and finished the sandwich in one minute. where the predicate grab selects for the simple type the noun sandwich is associated with (food), whereas finish coerces it to an event. The claim that the event sense exhibited by sandwich is coerced is supported by the low variability of event contexts in which sandwich appears (as opposed to lunch); see for example “during lunch” (780 hits for the Italian equivalent in our reference corpus, cf. section 3) vs. “*during the sandwich” (0 hits). Our goal is therefore twofold: evaluate whether at the empirical level it is possible to distinguish, among nouns appearing in copredication contexts, between complex types and simple (or complex) types subject to coercion effects; and propose a method to extract complex type nouns from corpora, combining distributional and lexicosyntactic pattern-based analyses. Our working hypothesis is that lexicalized complex types appear in copredication patterns more systematically, and so that high variability of pair of predicates in copredication contexts is evidence of complex type nouns, while low variability points to simple (or complex) type nouns subject to coercion effects. In the sections that follow, we will first raise the questions what counts as a copredication and what copredication really tell us about the underlying semantics of the nouns that support it. Then, we will introduce the experiments we conducted so far to verify our hypothesis. Finally, we will draw some conclusions and point at the experiments we have planned as future work.","We can therefore conclude that an experimental method to separate nouns of complex types from nouns subject to coercion appears possible. The proposed method constitutes the first attempt at semi-automatically extracting from corpus com- plex type nouns, something remaining elusive up to now. In addition, we learned that letter should be preferred over book as prototype of the com-plex type Info•Phys. In fact, this complex type is not the most straightforward since the dependence between the components of a dot object is not one-to-one. The case of Event • Food with lunch as prototype, in which there is such a tight symmetric dependence and no competition with separate sim-ple senses, might prove easier to deal with. This will be tackled in a next experiment. The predicate selection is a critical phase in the method proposed. It is difficult if not impossible to avoid polysemy and metaphorical uses, espe-cially since the relevant copredications are sparse and we cannot rely only on highly specialized un-frequent predicates. In future work, we plan to ex-periment with fully automatic selection, exploiting distributional semantics methods. Dimension re-duction through non-negative matrix factorization yields a possible interpretation of the dimensions in terms of “topics”, which is confirmed by ex-periments (Van de Cruys et al. 2011). Building on this, we shall check whether “topics” for predi-cates correspond to selectional restrictions suitable to build our copredication patterns.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The aim of such efforts is twofold: first, to compare the performance and choose the parser to participate in the EVALITA 2014 task on dependency parsing; second, to investigate
 how simple it is to apply freely available state-of-the-art dependency parsers to a new language/treebank.","Recently, there has been an increasing interest in dependency parsing, witnessed by the organisation of a number of shared tasks, e.g. Buchholz and Marsi (2006), Nivre et al. (2007). Concerning Italian, there have been tasks on dependency parsing in all the editions of the EVALITA evaluation campaign (Bosco et al., 2008; Bosco et al., 2009; Bosco and Mazzei, 2011; Bosco et al., 2014). In the 2014 edition, the task on dependency parsing exploits the Italian Stanford Dependency Treebank (ISDT), a new treebank featuring an annotation based on Stanford Dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). This paper reports the efforts involved in applying several state-of-the-art dependency parsers on ISDT. There are at least two motivations for such efforts. First, to compare the results and choose the parsers to participate in the EVALITA 2014 task on dependency parsing. Second, to investigate how simple it is to apply freely available state-of-the-art dependency parsers to a new language/ treebank following the instructions available together with the code and possibly having a few interactions with the developers. As in many other NLP fields, there are very few comparative articles when the performance of different parsers is compared. Most of the papers simply present the results of a newly proposed approach and compare them with the results reported in previous articles. In other cases, the papers are devoted to the application of the same tool to different languages/treebanks. It is important to stress that the comparison concerns tools used more or less out of the box and that the results cannot be used to compare specific characteristics like: parsing algorithms, learning systems, . . .","In the paper we have reported on work in progress on the comparison between several state-of-the-art dependency parsers on the Italian Stanford Dependency Treebank (ISDT). In the near future, we plan to widen the scope of the comparison including more parsers. Finally, we will perform an analysis of the results obtained by the different parsers considering not only their performance but also their behaviour in terms of speed, CPU load at training and parsing time, ease of use, licence agreement, . . .",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

The approach is new in that it combines pattern-based (P-based) and syntax-based (S-based) methods in or-der to obtain an integrated and unified view of a lexeme’s combinatory potential.","The term Word Combinations (WOCs), as used here, broadly refers to the range of combinatory possibilities typically associated with a word. On the one hand, it comprises so-called Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), intended as a variety of recurrent word combinations that act as a single unit at some level of linguistic analysis (Calzolari et al., 2002; Sag et al., 2002; Gries, 2008): they include phrasal lexemes, idioms, collocations, etc. On the other hand, WOCs also include the preferred distributional interactions of a word (be it a verb, a noun or an adjective) with other lexical entries at a more abstract level, namely that of argument structure patterns, subcategorization frames, and selectional preferences. Therefore, WOCs include both the normal combinations of a word and their idiosyncratic exploitations (Hanks, 2013). The full combinatory potential of a lexical entry can therefore be defined and observed at the level of syntactic dependencies and at the more constrained surface level. In both theory and practice, though, these two levels are often kept separate. Theoretically, argument structure is often perceived as a “regular” syntactic affair, whereas MWEs are characterised by “surprising properties not predicted by their component words” (Baldwin and Kim, 2010, 267). At the pratical level, in order to detect potentially different aspects of the combinatorics of a lexeme, different extraction methods are used – i.e. either a surface, patternbased (P-based) method or a deeper, syntax-based (S-based) method – as their performance varies according to the different types of WOCs/MWEs (Sag et al., 2002; Evert and Krenn, 2005). We argue that, in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of the combinatorial potential of a word and enhance extracting efficacy for WOCs, the P-based and S-based approaches should be combined. Thus, we extracted corpus data into a database where both P-based and S-based information is stored together and accessible at the same time. In this contribution we show its advantages. This methodology has been developed on Italian data, within the CombiNet1 project, aimed at building an online resource for Italian WOCs.","In this paper we presented SYMPAThy, a new method for the extraction of WOCs that exploits a variety of information typical of both P-based and S-based approaches. Although SYMPAThy was developed on Italian data, it can be adapted to other languages. In the future, we intend to exploit this combinatory base to model the gradient of schematicity/productivity and fixedness of combinations, in order to develop an “WOC-hood” indicator to classify the different types of WOCs on the basis of their distributional behavior.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In this article we want to analyze how radio can take advantage of social networks. In part-lare, we want to try to find a useful strategy for radio speakers to propose successful posts on platforms such as Facebook. So, we will ana-lize stylistically and linguistically a corpus of posts written by the spea-kers of a radio to correlate these ca-ratterists with the success of the post itself in terms of views and like.","The radio was introduced in Italy as a medium of mass communication in 1924 and was the master of the Italian era until in 1954 the television made its first wave. In fact, radio has always had to fight with means generated by an evolving technology. With the television, whose subscribers have grown very quickly (Fonti Istat; Ortoleva & Scaramucci, 2003) the radio has found an agreement. Important technological innovations have diversified radio from television in the 1950s and 1960s. The FM allowed a relatively low-cost multiplication of the broadcasting stations, allowing the at least partial overcoming of the Egeneralista√ì model of the TV in favour of a wider and varied offer of targeted programs; the transistor allowed the Radio to conquer spaces outside the domestic environment, while the birth of the radio allowed to follow the listeners even in their daily movements. Parallel to these new technologies, a new youth culture develops around the Radio, animated by the rolling rhythm of the Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll (medium of the Fifty Years) and inflated by the charm of disc reproduction (Monteleone, 2011). In the course of fifteen to twenty years from the first claims of the television media, the Radio had diversified its offer in terms of content and palinsesti. The radio fills the time spaces left free from the TV (morning hours and much of the afternoon hours). The personal, mobile, relatively distracted enjoyment became the underground and accompanying other daily activities, ending to delineate a characteristic trait of the relationship with the public, which became more intimate and deep (Menduni, 2003). This new dimension of listening leaves within a short time to realize the possibility of exploiting an ancient but great resource that, almost paradoxically, would give Radio the face of an innovative means: it is the telephone cable, a new channel through which to minimize the distances with the audience and give start to the age of interaction. On 7 January 1969 and ÃÉ in wave at 10:40 the first point of radio broadcast √àChiamate Rome 31-31√ì. There was an interaction with the public. In these years, Radio is forced to fight against a new enemy that could become its ally: the Web in its new version of Social Networks. As in the 50s and 60s the Radio reinvented itself by starting the interaction with the public, as in these years the Radio could exploit the Social Networks to reinvent itself. In this article we want to analyze how radio can take advantage of social networks. In particular, we want to try to propose a strategy to radio speakers to propose successful posts on platforms such as Facebook. So, we will analyze stylistically and linguistically a radio speakers post corpus to correlate these features with the success of the post itself in terms of views and likes. From this, we will try to derive some guidelines for writing successful posts. The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the method of stylistic, linguistic and content analysis of posts. Section 3 analyses the results on a set of radio speakers posts.","The results and observations obtained from this initial stude tend to partly confirm the effect-active impact of some parameters on the success of a post. In several cases for ÃÉ, the data obtained deli-neano new and unexpected scenarios. They are just re-sulted like these to lead us to a refles-sion on the substantial differences between the size on line and that on air of the radio, such as the man-cance (in the first case) of palinsesti and boundaries related to the schedules and then to the rou-tine of daily dates, and the par-ticular mechanism of flow, generated in primis by the coincidence and the unpredictable. The presented study can be a basis for co-building a predictive system capable of predicting whether a post can be successful as those used to predict film ratings (Pang, Lee, & Vaithyanathan, 2002).",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Accord-ing to the analysis, we define an index for the impact of a lexical resource, and we show that such index significantly corre-lates with the performance of a textual en-tailment system.","In the last decade text-to-text semantic inference has been a relevant topic in Computational Lin-guistics. Driven by the assumption that language understanding crucially depends on the ability to recognize semantic relations among portions of text, several text-to-text inference tasks have been proposed, including recognizing paraphrasing (Dolan and Brockett., 2005), recognizing textual entailment (RTE) (Dagan et al., 2005), and se-mantic similarity (Agirre et al., 2012). A common characteristic of such tasks is that the input are two portions of text, let’s call them Text1 and Text2, and the output is a semantic relation between the two texts, possibly with a degree of confidence of the system. For instance, given the* following text fragments: *Text1: George Clooneys longest relationship ever might have been with a pig. The actor owned Max, a 300-pound pig. Text2: Max is an animal.* *a system should be able to recognize that there is an ”entailment” relation among Text1 and Text2.* *While the task is very complex, requiring in principle to consider syntax, semantics and also pragmatics, current systems adopt rather sim-plified techniques, based on available linguistic resources. For instance, many RTE systems (Da-gan et al., 2012) would attempt to take advantage of the fact that, according to WordNet, the word animal in Text2 is a hypernym of the word pig in Text1. A relevant aspect in text-to-text tasks is that datasets are usually composed of textual pairs for positive cases, where a certain relation occurs, and negative pairs, where a semantic relation doesn’t appear. For instance, the following pair:* *Text1: John has a cat, named Felix, in his farm, it’s a Maine Coon, it’s the largest domesticated breed of cat. Text2: Felix is the largest domesticated animal in John’s farm.* shows a case of ”non-entailment”. In the paper we systematically investigate the re-lations between the distribution of lexical associa-tions in textual entailment datasets and the system performance. As a result we define a ”resource impact index” for a certain lexical resource with respect to a certain dataset, which indicates the capacity of the resource to discriminate between positive and negative pairs. We show that the ”re-source impact index” is homogeneous across sev-eral datasets and tasks, and that it correlates with the performance of the algorithm we chose in our experiments.","We have proposed a method for estimating the im-pact of a lexical resource on the performance of a text-to-text semantic inference system. The start-ing point has been the definition of the RID index, which captures the intuition that in current datasets useful resources need to discriminate between pos-itive and negative pairs. We have then shown that the RID index is highly correlated with the accu-racy of the system for balanced datasets and with the F1 for the unbalanced one, a result that allows to use the RID as a reliable indicator of the im-pact of a resource. As for future work, we intend to further general-ize our current findings applying the same method-ology to different text-to-text inference algorithms, starting from those already available in the EX-CITEMENT Open Platform. We also want to con-duct experiment on operation, like summing, with this index to describe to combined effect of differ-ent resources.",22,Distributional Semantics

Through an an- notation exercise leading to the creation of a 500 instance dataset, we show that the partitive fea- ture isn’t dominant, and the anaphoric properties of “ne”, syntactically and semantically, are what we should focus on for a comprehensive picture of this particle, also in view of its computational treatment.","The Italian particle “ne” is a clitic pronoun. Tradi-tionally, linguistic accounts of “ne” focus on two of its aspects: its syntactic behaviour and its being a conveyor of partitive relations. Syntactically, this particle has been studied extensively, especially in connection with unac-cusative verbs (Belletti and Rizzi, 1981; Burzio, 1986; Sorace, 2000). In Russi’s volume specifically dedicated to clitics, the chapter devoted to “ne” only focuses on the grammaticalisation process which brought the clitic to be incorporated in some verbs, causing it to lose its pronominal properties. It is referred to as “the ‘partitive’ ne” (Russi, 2008, p. 9). In (Cordin, 2001), the clitic is described in detail, and shown to serve three main uses. It can be a partitive pronoun, usually followed by a quantifier, as in (1). It can be used purely anaphorically to refer to a previously introduced entity, such as “medicine” in (2). The third use is as a locative adverb, like in (3).1 (1) Quanti giocatori di quell’U17-U19 quest’anno o l’anno scorso hanno giocato minuti importanti in prima squadra? A me ne risultano 2 o 3. How many players of that U17-U19 [team] this year or last year have played important minutes in the first team? I think 2 or 3 [of them] (2) Tu sai che la medicina fa bene e pretendi che il palato, pur sentendone l’amaro, continui a gustarla come se fosse dolce. You know that the medicine is good for you, and you ask your palate to enjoy it as if it was sweet, in spite of tasting [its] bitterness. (3) Me ne vado. I’m leaving. Note that for both partitive and non-partitive uses, in order to interpret the ne, the antecedent must be identified (“players of that U17-U19 [team]” in (1) and “medicine” for (2)). While there has been a recent effort to highlight the anaphoric properties of real occurrences of “ne” (Nissim and Perboni, 2008), there isn’t as yet a comprehensive picture of this particle. In this paper, we contribute a series of annotation schemes that capture the anaphoric nature of “ne”, and account for the different kinds of relations it establishes with its antecedent. We also contribute an annotated dataset that can be used for training automatic resolution systems, and that as of now provides us with a picture of this particle which is the most comprehensive to date.","Actual corpus data, annotated thanks to the development of specific annotation schemes focused on the anaphoric potential of “ne”, shows that the function of “ne” cannot be at all limited to a ‘partitive’ pronoun or as a test for certain syntactic types, as it is usually done in the theoretical literature. It also highlights several aspect of the anaphoric properties of “ne”, both semantically and syntactically. We plan to exploit the dataset to develop an automatic resolution system.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

First, we have built a small cooking recipe dataset second, we have
 done a qualitative morpho-syntactic analysis of the dataset and third we have done a quantitative analysis of the lexical coverage of the dataset.","The study reported in this paper is part of an applicative project in the field of nutrition. We are designing a software service for Diet Management (Fig. 1) that by using a smartphone allows one to retrieve, analyze and store the nutrition information about the courses. In our hypothetical scenario the interaction between the man and the food is mediated by an intelligent recommendation system that on the basis of various factors encourages or discourages the user to eat that specific course. The main factors that the system needs to account for are: (1) the diet that you intend to follow, (2) the food that have been eaten in the last days and, (3) the nutritional values of the ingredients of the course and its specific recipe. Crucially, in order to extract the complete salient nutrition information from a recipe, we need to analyze the sentences of the recipe. To allow the execution of this information extraction task we intend to use a syntactic parser together with a semantic interpreter. However, we intend to use both a deep interpreter, which have showed to have good performances in restricted domains (Fundel et al., 2007; Lesmo et al., 2013), as well as a shallow interpreter, that are most widely used in practical applications (Manning et al., 2008). In order to optimize the information extraction task we need to evaluate the specific features of the applicative domain (Fisher, 2001; Jurafsky, 2014). In the next Sections we present a preliminary study towards the realization of our NLP system, i.e. a linguistic analysis of the Italian recipes domain.","In this paper we presented a preliminary study on cooking recipes in Italian. The qualitative analysis emphatizes the importance of the sentence splitter and of the PoS tagger for a correct morpho-syntactic analysis. From the quantitative lexical coverage analysis we can draw a number of speculations. First, there is a great linguistic variation among cookbooks.

We describe the annotation schema proposed for Italian and report on the results of our corpus analysis.","In this work, we propose an annotation schema for factuality in Italian adapted from the schema for English developed in the NewsReader project1 (Tonelli et al., 2014) and describe the annotation performed on top of event annotation in the Ita-TimeBank (Caselli et al., 2011). We aim at the creation of a reference corpus for training and test-ing a factuality recognizer for Italian. The knowledge of the factual or non-factual na-ture of an event mentioned in a text is crucial for many applications (such as question answer-ing, information extraction and temporal reason-ing) because it allows us to recognize if an event refers to a real or to hypothetical situation, and en-ables us to assign it to its time of occurrence. In particular we are interested in the representation of information about a specific entity on a timeline, which enables easier access to related knowledge. The automatic creation of timelines requires the detection of situations and events in which target entities participate. To be able to place an event on a timeline, a system has to be able to select the events which happen or that are true at a certain point in time or in a time span. In a real context (such as the context of a newspaper article), the situations and events mentioned in texts can refer to real situations in the world, have no real coun-terpart, or have an uncertain nature. The FactBank guidelines are the reference guidelines for factuality in English and FactBank is the reference corpus (Sauri and Pustejovsky, 2009). More recently other guidelines and resources have been developed (Wonsever et al., 2012; van Son et al., 2014), but, to the best of our knowledge, no resources exist for event factuality in Italian.","In this paper we have presented an annotation schema of event factuality in Italian and the an-notation task done on the Ita-TimeBank. In our schema, factuality information is represented by three attributes: time of the event, polarity of the statement and certainty of the source about the event. We have selected from the Ita-TimeBank 170 documents containing 10,205 events and we have annotated them following the pro-posed annotation schema. The annotated corpus is freely available for non commer-cial purposes from https://hlt.fbk.eu/ technologies/fact-ita-bank. The resource has been used to develop a system based on machine learning for the automatic iden-tification of factuality in Italian. The tool has been evaluated on a test dataset and obtained 76.6% ac-curacy, i.e. the system identified the right value of the three attributes in 76.6% of the events. This system will be integrated in the TextPro tool suite (Pianta et al., 2008).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

This paper is based on the as-sumption that the proper treatment of MWEs in Natural Language Processing (NLP) appli-cations and in particular in Machine Transla-tion and Translation technologies calls for a computational approach which must be, at least partially, knowledge-based, and in par-ticular should be grounded on an explicit lin-guistic description of MWEs, both using an electronic dictionary and a set of rules. The hypothesis is that a linguistic approach can complement probabilistic methodologies to help identify and translate MWEs correctly since hand-crafted and linguistically-motivated resources, in the form of electronic dictionaries and local grammars, obtain accu-rate and reliable results for NLP purposes. The methodology adopted for this research work is based on (i) Nooj, an NLP environ-ment which allows the development and test-ing of the linguistic resources, (ii) an electron-ic English-Italian MWE dictionary, (iii) a set of local grammars. The dictionary mainly consists of English phrasal verbs, support verb constructions, idiomatic expressions and col-locations together with their translation in Ital-ian and contains different types of MWE POS patterns.","This paper presents a bilingual dictionary of MWEs from English to Italian. MWEs are a complex linguistic phenomenon, ranging from lexical units with a relatively high degree of internal variability to expressions that are frozen or semi-frozen. They are very frequent and productive word groups both in everyday languages and in languages for special purposes and are the result of human creativity which is not ruled by algorithmic processes, but by very complex processes which are not fully representable in a machine code since they are driven by flexibility and intuition. Their interpretation and translation sometimes present unexpected obstacles mainly because of inherent ambiguities, structural and lexical asymmetries between languages and, finally, cultural differences. The identification, interpretation and translation of MWEs still represent open challenges, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, in the field of Machine Translation and Translation technologies. Empirical approaches bring interesting complementary robustness-oriented solutions but taken alone, they can hardly cope with this complex linguistic phenomenon for various reasons. For instance, statistical approaches fail to identify and process non high-frequent MWEs in texts or, on the contrary, they are not able to recognise strings of words as single meaning units, even if they are very frequent. Furthermore, MWEs change continuously both in number and in internal structure with idiosyncratic morphological, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and translational behaviours. The main assumption of this paper is that the proper treatment of MWEs in NLP applications calls for a computational approach which must be, at least partially, knowledge-based, and in particular should be grounded on an explicit linguistic description of MWEs, both using a dictionary and a set of rules. The methodology adopted for this research work is based on: (I) Nooj an NLP environment which allows the development and testing of the linguistic resources, (ii) an electronic English-Italian (EI) MWE dictionary, based on an accurate linguistic description that accounts for different types of MWEs and their semantic properties by means of well-defined steps: identification, interpretation, disambiguation and finally application, (iii) a set of local grammars.","In conclusion, the focus of this research for the coming years will be to improve the results ob-tained so far and to extend the research work to provide a more comprehensive methodology for MWE processing in MT and translation technol-ogies, taking into account not only the analysis phase but also the generation one. This experiment provides, on the one hand, an investigation of a broad variety of combinations of MWE types and an exemplification of their behaviour in texts extracted from different corpo-ra and, on the other hand, a representation method that foresees the interaction of an electronic dic-tionary and a set of local grammars to efficiently handle different types of MWEs and their proper-ties in MT as well as in other types of NLP appli-cations. This research work has therefore produced two main results in the field of MWE processing so far: the development of a first version of an English-Italian electronic dictionary, spe-cifically devoted to different MWEs types, the analysis of a first set of specific MWE structures from a semanto-syntactic point of view and the develop-ment of local grammars for the identifica-tion of continuous and discontinuous MWEs in the form of FST/FSA.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In this study, a detailed lin- guistic analysis in the discourse among the class members is proposed in five distinct test case scenarios, in order to detect whether a Virtual Class is a community or not. Com- munities are of particular importance as they provide benefits to students and effectively improve knowledge perception. This analysis is focused on two axes: inner speech and col- laborative learning as they both are basic fea- tures of a community.","Virtual Learning Communities (VLCs) constitute an aspect of particular importance for Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). The stronger the sense of community is, the more effectively is learning perceived, resulting in less isolation and greater satisfaction (Rovai, 2002; Daniel et al, 2003; Innes, 2007). Strong feelings of community provide benefits to students by increasing 1) the commitment to group goals, 2) collaboration among them and 3) motivation to learn (Rovai, 2002). Virtual Classes (VCs) are frequently created and embodied in the learning procedure (Dillenbourg and Fischer, 2007). Nevertheless there are questions arising: Is every VC always a community as well? How can we detect the existence of a community? What are its idiosyncratic properties? Sharing of knowledge within a community is achieved through shared codes and language (Daniel et al, 2003; Stahl, 2000; Innes, 2007). Language is not only a communication tool; it also serves knowledge and information exchange (Dillenbourg and Fischer, 2007; Knipfer et al, 2009; Daniel et al, 2003; Bielaczyc and Collins, 1999). Communication and dialogue are in a privileged position in the learning process due to the assumption that knowledge is socially constructed (Innes, 2007). Collaborative learning (CL) is strongly associated with communities as it occurs when individuals are actively engaged in a community in which learning takes place through collaborative efforts (Stahl et al, 2006). This active engagement is achieved through public discussion, which is a central way for a community to expand its knowledge (Bielaczyc and Collins, 1999). Developing an understanding of how meaning is collaboratively constructed, preserved, and re-learned through the media of language in group interaction, is a challenge for CL theory (Daniel et al, 2003;Wells, 2002; Warschauer, 1997; Koschmann, 1999). Inner speech (IS) is an esoteric mental language, usually not outerly expressed, having an idiosyncratic syntax. When outerly expressed, its structure consists of apparent lack of cohesion, extensive fragmentation and abbreviation compared to the outer (formal) language used in most everyday interactions. Clauses keep only the predicate and its accompanying words, while the subject and its dependents are omitted. This does not lead to misunderstandings if the thoughts of the individuals are in accordance (they form a community). The more identical the thoughts of the individuals are, the less linguistic cues are used (Vygotsky, 2008; Socolov, 1972). Various works using discourse analysis have been presented in the CSCL field: some of them focus on the role of dialogue (Wells, 2002), others examine the relationship between teachers and students (Blau et al., 1998; Veermans and Cesareni, 2005), while others focus on the type of the language used (Maness, 2008; Innes, 2007), on knowledge building (Zhang et al., 2007), or on the scripts addressed (Kollar et al., 2005). Spanger et al. (2009) analyzed a corpus of referring expressions targeting to develop algorithms for generating expressions in a situated collaboration. Other studies use machine learning techniques in order to build automated classifiers of affect in chat logs (Brooks, 2013). Rovai (2002), examined the relationship between the sense of community and cognitive learning in an online educational environment. Daniel et al. (2003) explored how the notions of social capital and trust can be extended in virtual communities. Unlike these studies, the proposed approach, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, takes into account the correlation between community properties and both inner speech and collaborative learning features (Bielaczyc and Collins, 1999) by applying linguistic analysis to the discourse among class members as a means for community detection. To this end, the discourse of four different types of VCs is analyzed and compared against non-conversational language use.","Applying linguistic analysis to the discourse among the members of a VC can provide us with useful results. Combining the result of the two categories (inner speech and collaboration) we can get strong indications of community existence. Furthermore, results of the analysis can help us improve the design of the VCs. However there is room for future research, e.g. applying this model and evaluating it on a larger corpus and different case studies.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

This is the first phase of a search to develop errors reduction strategies.","The research project was born from a collaboration-in between the University of Salerno and Cedat 85, the leading company in Italy in the self-matic treatment of the speaker. The purpose of the project is a accurate assessment of errors produced by an automatic speaker transcription system (ASR), passed to the sequel of a more detailed linguistic analysis and subsequent metadata. The most used word error rate (WER) estimate of an ASR system is calculated automatically and is based on the analysis of a manual transcription (aligned to the signal) and the relative transcription obtained by the ASR system. This comparison identifies the wrong words (Substitutions), the missing words (Deletetions) and the wrongly inserted words (Insertions) as well as the total words (N) for an assessment: WER = (S+D+I)x100 N This estimate does not enter into the cause n≈Ω of the relevance of the error, making it rather a maximum reference for a gross assessment of an ASR system, without any indication on its real utility and adequacy, n≈Ω on the possibilities of intervention and improvement. Most of the last-generation ASR systems, which work on spontanely speaking, use technologies and algorithms that can best exploit the enormous power of calculation currently available, but differ significantly in the choice of parameters, intermediate steps, in the selection criteria of most likely candidates, in the tools for the processing of ad-training data. A quality criterion, as well as quantitative, of error assessment is necessary for an adaptation of the system to the reference environment, and for the indication of possible improvement interventions. Recent studies, both technological and lin-guistic and psycholinguistic, indicate correlations between errors and frequency in the vocabulary or in the use of words, speaking speed, ambiguity (homophony) and acoustic confundability (minimum and sub-minimum couples). However, there are missing systematic studies that take into account the correlation with morph-lesical classes, phonological and sillabic structures, syntagmatic sequences, the order of the constituents and above all, prosodic factors. In this contribution we present a first part of the results of a broader research on the weight of these factors, suffering on the criteria of the language classification of data and on the correlations achieved between the presence (and type) of error and phono-morphological and morphosynthetic categories.","In this preliminary phase of analysis, it seems to be possible to draw a first important conclusion: the quantitative assessment of the word error rate surpasses the failure of recognition of an ASR system. The metadata made and the subsequent quality assessment normalizes the data of the WER and redirect the mag-the best rate to unpredictable phenomena as little significant for the measurement of the efficiency of the system. In this context, indeed, the indecision and confusion of graphic rendering are almost equal to self-matic and manual transcription. Nevertheless, the weight of the wrong recognitions of these segments can be reduced by adopting a thinner annotation scheme, both in terms of more solid standards for transcribers and as a model for the ASR system. We end up supposing that some secondary interventions on the phone set, the enrichment of the vocabulary with the possible phonetic variants, and a better treatment of prosodic phenomena could improve the performance of the system to some extent.",13,Multimodal

In this paper, we illustrate the automatic creation of a NE-annotated domain corpus used to adapt an existing NER to Italian WWI texts. We discuss the annotation of the training and test corpus and provide re-sults of the system evaluation.","Increasing amounts of sources about World War I (WWI) are nowadays available in digital form. The centenary of the Great War is also going to foster this trend, with new historical sources being digitized. This wealth of digital documents offers us an unprecedented possibility to achieve a multidimensional and multiperspectival insight on war events, understanding how soldiers and citizens of different countries and social conditions experienced and described the events in which they were involved together, albeit on opposite fronts and with different roles. Grasping this unique opportunity however calls for advanced methods for the automatic semantic analysis of digital historical sources. The application of NLP methods and tools to historical texts is indeed attracting growing interest and raises interesting and highly challenging research issues (Piotrowsky 2012). The research presented in this paper is part of a larger project dealing with the digitization and computational analysis of Italian War Bulletins of the First World War (for details see Boschetti et al. 2014). In particular, we focus here on the domain and language adaptation of a Named Entity Recognizer (NER) for Italian. As a byproduct of this project, we illustrate the automatic creation of a NE-annotated domain corpus used to adapt the NER to the WWI texts. War bulletins (WBs) were issued by the Italian Comando Supremo “Supreme Headquarters” during WWI and WWII as the official daily report about the military operations of the Italian armed forces. They are plenty of Named Entities, mostly geographical locations, often referring to small places unmarked in normal geographic maps or with their name changed during the last century because of geopolitical events, hence hardly attested in any gazetteer. To accomplish the Named Entity Recognition task, several approaches have been proposed such as Rule Based Systems (Grover et al., 2008; Mikheev et al., 1999a; Mikheev et al., 1999b), Machine Learning based (Alex et al., 2006; Finkel et al., 2005; Hachey et al., 2005; Nissim et al., 2004, including HMM, Maximum Entropy, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines and Conditional Random Field) and hybrid approaches (Srihari et al., 2001). We used a Machine Learning approach to recognize NEs. Rule-based systems usually give good results, but require long development time by expert linguists. Machine learning techniques, on the contrary, use a collection of annotated documents for training the classifiers. Therefore the development time moves from the definition of rules to the preparation of annotated corpora. The problems of the NER in WWI bulletins are larger than those encountered in modern texts. The language used in such texts is early 20th century Italian, which is quite different from contemporary Italian in many respects and belongs to the technical and military jargon. These texts are therefore difficult to analyze using available Italian resources for NER, typically based on contemporary, standard Italian. Grover et al. (2008) describe the main problems encountered by NER systems on historical texts. They evaluated a rule-based NER system for person and place names on two sets of British Parliamentary records from the 17th and 19th centuries. One of the most important issues they had to deal was the gap between archaic and contemporary language. This paper is structured as follows: In section 2, we present the CoLingLab NER and in section 3 we describe its adaptation to WWI texts.","Location names play an important role in histori-cal texts, especially in those - like WBs - describ-ing the unfolding of military operations. In this paper, we presented the results of adapting an Italian NER to Italian texts about WWI through the automatic creation of a new NE-annotated corpus of WBs. The adapted NER shows a significantly increased ability to identify Locations. In the near feature, we aim at processing other types of texts about the Great War (e.g., letters, diaries and newspapers) as part of a more general project of information extraction and text mining of war memories.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Network Analysis of a Latin Dependency Treebank,ENG,1,0,0,Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Milan,"Network theory provides a suitable framework to model the structure of language as a complex system. Based on a network built from a Latin dependency treebank, this paper applies methods for network analysis to show the key role of the verb sum (to be) in the overall structure of the network.","Considering language as a complex system with deep relations between its components is a widespread approach in contemporary linguistics (Briscoe, 1998; Lamb, 1998; Steels, 2000; Hudson, 2007). Such a view implies that language features complex network structures at all its levels of analysis (phonetic, morphological, lexical, syntactic, semantic). Network theory provides a suitable framework to model the structure of linguistic systems from such a perspective. Network theory is the study of elements, called vertices or nodes, and their connections, called edges or links. A complex network is a (un)directed graph G(V, E) which is given by a set of vertices V and a set of edges E (Ferrer i Cancho, 2010). Vertices and edges can represent different things in networks. In a language network, the vertices can be different linguistic units (for instance, words), while the edges can represent different kinds of relations holding between these units (for instance, syntactic relations). So far, all the network-based studies in linguistics have concerned modern and living languages (Mehler, 2008a). However, times are mature enough for extending such approach also to the study of ancient languages. Indeed, the last years have seen a large growth of language resources for ancient languages. Among these resources are syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks), which provide essential information for building syntactic language networks.","While the most widespread tools for querying and analyzing treebanks give results in terms of lists of words or sequences of trees, network analysis permits a synoptic view of all the relations that hold between the words in a treebank. This makes network analysis a powerful method to fully exploit the structural information provided by a treebank, for a better understanding of the properties of language as a complex system with interconnnected elements.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In this paper we propose a new methodology that integrates the chatterbot technology with the Cog-nitive Linguistics (CL) (Langacker, 1987) princi-ples, with the aim of developing a QA system that is able to harvest a linguistic knowledge from its inner KB, and use it for composing answers dy-namically. Grammatical templates and structures tailored to the Italian language that are construc-tions of the Construction Grammar (CxG) (Gold-berg, 1995) and a linguistic Italian source of verbs have been developed purposely, and used for the NL production. The result of the methodology im-plementation is I-ChatbIT, an Italian chatbot that is intelligent not only for the dynamic nature of the answers, but in the sense of cognitive under-standing and production of NL sentences. Cog-nitive understanding of the NL query is achieved by placing it in the system’s KB, which represents the conceptualization of the world as it has been perceived by the agent. The outcome of such a process is the generation of what we call the mean-ing activation subgraph in the KB. Browsing this subgraph, the system elaborates and detects the content of the answer, that is next grammatically composed through the linguistic base. The FCG engine is then used as the key component for pro-ducing the answer. Summarily, the work reports the modeling of the two tasks outlined above. The paper is arranged as follow: in the next section the most popular chatbots are shown, devoting par-ticular attention to the Italian ones. Section 3 de-scribes the implemented methodology explaining in detail a practical example. Finally, conclusions and future works are discussed in section 4.","A novel chatbot architecture for the Italian language has been presented that is aimed at implementing cognitive understanding of the query by locating its correspondent subgraph in the agent’s KB by means of a GED strategy based on the k- AT algorithm, and the Jaro–Winkler distance. The FCG engine is used for producing replies starting from the semantic poles extracted from the candidate answers’ subgraphs. The system implements a suitable disambiguation strategy for selecting the correct answer by analyzing the commonsense knowledge related to the adverbs in the query that is embedded in the lexical constructions of the adverbs themselves as a proper set of features. Future works are aimed at completing the IVS, and using explicit commonsense knowledge inside the KB for fine disambiguation.

58_2014,2014,CLICIT2014158,"Vito Pirrelli, Claudia Marzi, Marcello Ferro",Two-dimensional Wordlikeness Effects in Lexical Organisation,ENG,3,1,0,CNR-ILC,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"The main focus of research on wordlikeness has been on how serial pro-cessing strategies affect perception of similarity and, ultimately, the global net-work of associative relations among words in the mental lexicon. Compara-tively little effort has been put so far, however, into an analysis of the reverse relationship: namely, how global organi-sation effects influence the speakers’ per-ception of word similarity and of words’ internal structure. In this paper, we ex-plore the relationship between the two dimensions of wordlikeness (the “syn-tagmatic” and the “paradigmatic” one), to suggest that the same set of principles of memory organisation can account for both dimensions.","The language faculty requires the fundamental ability to retain sequences of symbolic items, access them in recognition and production, find similarities and differences among them, and assess their degree of typicality (or WORDLIKE- NESS) with respect to other words in the lexicon. In particular, perception of formal redundancy appears to be a crucial precondition to morphol-ogy induction, epitomised by the so-called WORD ALI GNMENT problem. The problem arises when-ever one has to identify recurrence of the same pattern at different positions in time, e.g. book in handbook, or mach in both German macht and gemacht. Clearly, no “conjunctive” letter coding scheme (e.g., Coltheart et al. 2001; Harm & Seidenberg 1999; McClelland & Rumelhart 1981; Perry et al. 2007; Plaut et al. 1996), which requires that the representation of each symbol in a string be anchored to its position, would account for such an ability. In Davis’ (2010) SPATIAL ENCODING, the identity of the letter is described as a Gaussian activity function whose max value is centred on the letter’s actual position, enforcing a form of fuzzy matching, common to other models disjunctively encoding a symbol and its position (Grainger & van Heuven 2003; Henson 1998; Page & Norris 1998, among others). The role of specific within-word letter positions interacts with short-term LEXICAL BUFFERING and LEXICALITY effects. Recalling a stored representation requires that all symbols forming that representation are simultaneously activated and sustained in working memory, waiting to be serially retrieved. Buffering accounts for the comparative difficulty in recalling long words: more concurrently-activated nodes are easier to be confused, missed or jumbled than fewer nodes are. Notably, more frequent words are less likely to be confused than low-frequency words, since long-term entrenchment improves performance of immediate serial recall in working memory (Baddeley 1964; Gathercole et al. 1991). Serial (or syntagmatic) accounts of local ordering effects in word processing are often complemented by evidence of another, more global (or paradigmatic) dimension of word perception, based on the observation that, in the normal course of processing a word, other non-target neighbouring words become active. In the word recognition literature, there is substantial agreement on the inhibitory role of lexical neighbours (Goldinger et al. 1989; Luce & Pisoni 1998; Luce et al. 1990). Other things being equal, target words with a large number of neighbours take more time to be recognised and repeated, as they suffer from their neighbours’ competition in lexical buffering. This is particularly true when the target word is low-frequency. Nonetheless, there is contrasting evidence that dense neighbourhoods may speed up word reading time rather than delaying it (Huntsman & Lima 2002), and that high-entropy word families make their members more readily accessible than lowentropy families (Baayen et al. 2006). Marzi et al. (2014) provide clear computational evidence of interactive effects of paradigm regularity and type/token lexical frequency on the acquisition of German verb inflection. Token frequency plays a paramount role in item-based learning, with highly frequent words being acquired at comparatively earlier stages than lowfrequency words. Morphological regularity, on the other hand, has an impact on paradigm acquisition, regular paradigms being learned, on average, within a shorter time span than fully or partially irregular paradigms. Finally, frequency distribution of paradigmatically-related words significantly interacts with morphological regularity. Acquisition of regular paradigms depends less heavily on item-based storage and is thus less affected by differences in frequency distributions of paradigm members. Conversely, irregular paradigms are less prone to be generalised through information spreading and their acquisition mainly relies on itemised storage, thus being more strongly affected by the frequency distribution of paradigm members and by frequencybased competition, both intra- and interparadigmatically. We suggest that compounded evidence of wordlikeness and paradigm frequency effects can be accounted for within a unitary computational model of lexical memory. We provide here preliminary evidence in this direction, by looking at the way a specific, neuro-biologically inspired computational model of lexical memories, Temporal Self-Organising Maps (TSOMs), accounts for such effects.","Wordlikeness is a fundamental determinant of lexical organisation and access. Two quantitative measures of wordlikeness, namely n-gram probability and neighbourhood density, relate to important dimensions of lexical organisation: the syntagmatic (or horizontal) dimension, which controls the level of predictability and entrenchment of a serial memory trace, and the paradigmatic (or vertical) dimension, which controls the number of neighbours that are co-activated by the target word. The two dimensions are nicely captured by TSOMs, allowing the investigation of their dynamic interaction. In accessing and recalling a target word, a large pool of neighbours can be an advantage, since they tend to support patterns of activation that are shared by the target word. However, their help may turn out to interfere with recall, if the connection strength of one or more neighbours is overwhelmingly higher than that of the target. Deeply entrenched friends eventually become competitors. This dynamic establishes a nice connection with paradigm acquisition, where a uniform distribution of paradigm members is helpful in spreading morphotactic information and speed up acquisition, and paradigmatically- related forms in skewed distributions compete with one another (Marzi et al. 2014). We argue that both neighbourhood and morphological effects are the result of predictive (syntagmatic) activation and competitive (paradigmatic) co-activation of parallel processing nodes in densely interconnected networks. As a final qualification, our experiments illustrate the dynamic of activation and storage of letter strings, with no information about morphological content. They provide evidence of the first access stages of early lexical processing, where strategies of automatic segmentation are sensitive to possibly apparent morphological information (Post et al. 2008). Nonetheless, our data suggest that perception of wordlikeness and morphological structure can be accounted for by a common pool of principles governing the organisation of long-term memories for time series.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We present a probabilistic model for sense dis-ambiguation that exploits the semantic fea-tures associated to each argument position of a verb.","Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (see (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006) for a comprehensive survey of the topic) is a task in Computational Linguistics where a system has to automatically select the cor-rect sense of a target word in context, given a list of possible senses for it. For instance, given the target word chair in the context of the sentence The cat is on the chair, and given two possible senses for the word, let’s call them chair as forniture and chair as human, a WSD system should be able to select the first sense as the appropriate one. An important aspect of WSD is that its complexity is affected by the ambiguity (i.e. the number of senses) of the words to be disambiguated. This has led in the past to discussing various characteristics of available sense repositories (e.g. WordNet, Fell-baum 1998), including the nature and the number of sense distinctions, particularly with respect to the application goals of WSD. In this paper we address Word Sense Disam-biguation of Italian verbs. Differently form pre-vious work on WSD for Italian (Bertagna et al. 2007), where the sense repository was ItalWordNet (Roventini et al. 2003), in our experiments we use verb senses derived from T-PAS, a repository of Typed Predicate Argument Structures for Italian acquired from corpora. There are two benefits of this choice: (i) word sense distinctions are now grounded on actual sense occurrences in corpora, this way ensuring a natural selection with respect of sense granularity; (ii) as in T-PAS for each verb sense a number of sentences are collected, there is no further need to annotate data for training and testing, avoiding the issue of re-interpreting sense distinctions by different people. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces T-PAS, including the methodology for its acquisition. Section 3 presents the probabilistic model that we have used for verb disambiguation and Section 4 reports on experimental results.","We have presented a word sense disambiguation system for Italian verbs, whose senses have been derived from T-PAS, a lexical resource that we have recently developed. This is the first work (we hope that many others will follow) attempting to use T-PAS for a NLP task. The WSD system takes advantage of the T-PAS structure, particularly the presence of semantic types for each verbal argument position. Results, although preliminary, show a very good precision. As for the future, we intend to consolidate the disambiguation methodology and we aim at a more detailed annotation of the sentence argument, corresponding to the internal structure of verb patterns. We plan to extend the analysis of the relationship between senses of the different positions in a pattern in order to implement a metrics based on tree and also to substitute the role of the parser with an independent pattern matching system. The probabilistic model presented in Section 3 can be extended in order to determine also the probability that a certain word is a syntactic head.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The system simulation with Oz's Magician was aimed at a voice dialogue without restrictions by the subject, both at the turn management level and at the phrase composition level.","In this work we present a man-machine dialog corpus acquired within the framework of the Speaky Acutattile project, a digital platform for domestication designed for the support of weak outness (older, non-visible, etc.).In this case, it is necessary to ensure that you have the right to use this product in order to ensure that you have the right to use this product in order to ensure that you have the right to use this product.

The technique, although requires more attention and resources than other speaker selection strategies, is commonly placed among the most reliable systems for user-oriented voice interfaces prototyping and data collection on how to interact with users. Excepting some structural vices related to the experimental context (such as the subject‚Äôs minor involvement compared to the real user), the relevance of a machine dialog corpus collected with this method is determined by the definition of certain parameters that a priori determine the behavior of the Mago, in fact making it by the user as possible assimilable to a machine (machine-like).

More specifically, it reports the conversion pro-cess, currently implemented as a proto-type, into the Universal SD format, more oriented to a cross-linguistic perspective and, therefore, more suitable for the pur-pose of our resource.","1 Introduction The increasing need to use language resources for the development and training of automatic systems goes hand in hand with the opportunity to make such resources available and accessible. This op-portunity, however, is often precluded by the use of different formats for encoding linguistic con-tent. Such differences may be dictated by sev-eral factors that, in the specific case of syntacti-cally annotated corpora, or treebanks, may include the choice of constituency vs dependency-based paradigm, the specific morphological and syntac-tical features of the language at issue, or the end use the resource has been designed for. This vari-ety of formats makes it more difficult the reuse of these resources in different contexts. In the case of parsing, and of treebanks, a few steps towards the spread of formats that could be easily shared by the community has led, also thanks to the efforts devoted to the organization of evaluation campaigns, to the use of what have then become de facto standards. This is the case, for example, of the Penn Treebank format for con-stituency paradigms (Mitchell et al., 1993). Within the framework of dependency-based rep-resentations, a new format has recently gained in-creasing success, i.e. that of the Stanford Typed Dependencies. The emergence of this format is attested by several projects on the conversion and harmonization of treebanks into this representa-tion format (Bosco et al., 2013; Haverinen et al., 2013; McDonald et al., 2013; Tsarfaty, 2013; Rosa et al., 2014). The project described in this paper is part of these ones and concerns in particular the conversion into the Stanford Dependencies of a multilingual parallel treebank for Italian, English and French called ParTUT. The next section will provide a brief description of ParTUT and its native format, along with that of the Universal Stanford Dependencies, while Section 3 will be devoted to the description of the conversion process, with some observations on its implications in the future development of ParTUT.","In this paper, we briefly described the ongoing project of conversion of a multilingual parallel treebank from its native representation format, i.e. TUT, into the Universal Stanford Dependencies. The main advantages of such attempt lie in the opportunity to release the parallel resource in a widely recognized annotation format that opens its usability to a number of NLP tasks, and in a resulting representation of parallel syntactic structures that are more uniform and, therefore, easier to put in correspondence. Conversion, however, is not a straightforward process, and a number of issues are yet to be tackled in order to obtain a converted version that is fully compliant with the target format. The next steps of this work will focus in particular on such issues.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

In this paper, we will describe the experiences carried on at the Computer Science Department of the University of Turin in the development of cor-pora and tools for Sentiment Analysis and Opin-ion Mining (SA&OM) during the last few years. These experiences grew and are still growing in a scenario where an heterogeneous group of re-searchers featured by skills varying from compu-tational linguistics, sociology, visualization tech-niques, big data analysis and ontologies cooper-ates.

However, currently, there is no effective measure to discriminate antonyms from synonyms because they share many common features. In this paper, we introduce APAnt, a new Average-Precision-based measure for the unsupervised identification of antonymy using Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs). APAnt makes use of Average Precision to estimate the extent and salience of the intersection among the most descriptive contexts of two target words. Evaluation shows that the proposed method is able to distinguish antonyms and synonyms with high accuracy, outperforming a baseline model implementing the co-occurrence hypothesis.","Antonymy is one of the fundamental relations shaping the organization of the semantic lexicon and its identification is very challenging for computational models (Mohammad et al., 2008). Yet, antonymy is essential for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as Machine Translation (MT), Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Information Retrieval (IR) (Roth and Schulte im Walde, 2014; Mohammad et al., 2013). As well as for other semantic relations, computational lexicons and thesauri explicitly encoding antonymy already exist. Although such resources are often used to support the above mentioned NLP tasks, they have low coverage and many scholars have shown their limits: Mohammad et al. (2013), for example, have noticed that “more than 90% of the contrasting pairs in GRE closest-to-opposite questions are not listed as opposites in WordNet”. The automatic identification of semantic relations is a core task in computational semantics. Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) have often been used for their well known ability to identify semantically similar lexemes using corpus-derived co-occurrences encoded as distributional vectors (Santus et al., 2014a; Baroni and Lenci, 2010; Turney and Pantel, 2010; Padó and Lapata, 2007; Sahlgren, 2006). These models are based on the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954) and represent lexical semantic similarity in function of distributional similarity, which can be measured by vector cosine (Turney and Pantel, 2010). However, these models are characterized by a major shortcoming. That is, they are not able to discriminate among different kinds of semantic relations linking distributionally similar lexemes. For instance, the nearest neighbors of castle in the vector space typically include hypernyms like building, co-hyponyms like house, meronyms like brick, antonyms like shack, together with other semantically related words. While impressive results have been achieved in the automatic identification of synonymy (Baroni and Lenci, 2010; Padó and Lapata, 2007), methods for the identification of hypernymy (Santus et al., 2014a; Lenci and Benotto, 2012) and antonymy (Roth and Schulte im Walde, 2014; Mohammad et al., 2013) still need much work to achieve satisfying precision and coverage (Turney, 2008; Mohammad et al., 2008). This is the reason why semisupervised pattern-based approaches have often been preferred to purely unsupervised DSMs (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Hearst, 1992) In this paper, we introduce a new Average- Precision-based distributional measures that is able to successfully discriminate antonyms from synonyms, outperforming a baseline implementing the co-occurrence hypothesis, formulated by Charles and Miller in 1989 and confirmed in other studies, such as those of Justeson and Katz (1991) and Fellbaum (1995).","This paper introduces APAnt, a new distributional measure for the identification of antonymy (an extended version of this paper will appear in Santus et al., 2014b). APAnt is evaluated in a discrimination task in which both antonymy- and synonymy-related pairs are present. In the task, APAnt has outperformed the baseline implementing the co-occurrence hypothesis (Fellbaum, 1995; Justeson and Katz, 1991; Charles and Miller, 1989) by 17%. APAnt performance supports our hypothesis, according to which synonyms share a number of salient contexts that is significantly higher than the one shared by antonyms. Ongoing research includes the application of APAnt to discriminate antonymy also from other semantic relations and to automatically extract antonymy-related pairs for the population of ontologies and lexical resources. Further work can be conducted to apply APAnt to other languages.",22,Distributional Semantics

In this paper, we describe our approach and a specific case study in which we show the results of a real at- tempt of text recovery. The most im- portant effort for us has been the study and comprehension of more or less com- plex specific data formats, almost always tied to an obsolete technology.","The international scientific communities consider electronic resources as a central part of cultural and intellectual heritage. Many institutions are involved in international initiatives 1 directed to the preservation of digital materials. The Digital Preservation Europe project (DPE) is an example of a collaboration which involved many scientific communities at the international level, aimed at achieving the long-term preservation of resources. ""Digital preservation is the active manage-ment of digital content over time to ensure ongo-ing access. Digital preservation may be applied to any form of information that is stored in a digital format. Digital preservation is necessary to ensure that the increasing quantity of digital information, created and stored by individuals and institutions, is available for current and future use. As digi-tal information is created in a variety of formats, and stored on a variety of media, it is often vulner-able to damage or loss due to environmental fac-tors, physical deterioration, or obsolescence of storage media and software applications. Digital materials may also be vulnerable to damage or loss due to malicious attack, accidental or intentional destruction, or human error. Digital preservation is an important part of a comprehensive approach to information management, and it is essential to pre-serve the authenticity, integrity, and accessibility of digital information over time. Digital preservation requires the development and implementation of policies, procedures, and technologies to ensure the long-term management of digital content. Dig-ital preservation is a complex and evolving field, and it is important to stay informed about the latest developments in order to make informed deci-sions about the management of digital content."" (Verheul 2006: 11-12) ""Digital preservation combines policies, strate-gies and actions that ensure access to digital con-tent over time. Digital preservation is broadly con-cerned with the discovery, acquisition, selection, appraisal, access, and long-term management of digital materials, regardless of format. Long-term management is an essential part of digital preser-vation and involves addressing issues such as changing technology, the fragility of digital media, and the need to maintain the authenticity and in-tegrity of digital information in the face of storage media failure and technological change. The goal of digital preservation is the accurate rendering of authenticated content over time."" (ALA 2007:2) In our specific case we are engaged in looking for systems and techniques necessary for the long-term management of digital textual materi-als, stored at ILC over many years of work. At the beginning we did not know the age of all the materials. However, at a later stage, we found a number of digital materials, some of which dated as far back as the 70’s. For this reason, the work of recovery is extremely complex and demand-ing. Firstly, the format of file/text encoding was often obsolete and not associated with exhaustive documentation. Secondly, many texts contained disused linguistic annotation schemas. Conse-quently, we have adopted different strategies for “textual resource” retrieval, before focusing our attention on the application of standardized measures for conservation of the texts.","The preservation of that data produced with out-dated technologies should be handled especially by public institutions, as this is part of the histor-ical heritage. Therefore, it is necessary for us to complete this work, so that the resources can be reused. This will be possible only through a joint effort of the institutions involved at the regional, national and international levels.

Existing models use syntactic dependencies for this. Our Distributional Memory model outperforms a syntax-based model by a wide margin, matches an augmented model that uses hand-crafted rules, and provides results that can be easily combined with the augmented model, improving matching over multiple thematic fit judgement tasks.","It is perfectly conceivable that automated tasks in natural language semantics can be accomplished entirely through models that do not require the contribution of semantic features to work at high accuracy. Unsupervised semantic role labellers such as that of Titov and Klementiev (2011) and Lang and Lapata (2011) do exactly this: predict semantic roles strictly from syntactic realizations. In other words, for practical purposes, the relevant and frequent semantic cases might be completely covered by learned syntactic information. For example, given a sentence The newspaper was put on the table, such SRL systems would identify that the table should receive a “location” role purely from the syntactic dependencies centered around the preposition on. We could extend this thinking to a slightly different task: thematic fit modelling. It could well be the case that the the table could be judged a more appropriate filler of a location role for put than, e.g., the perceptiveness, entirely due to information about the frequency of word collocations and syntactic dependencies collected through corpus data, handmade grammars, and so on. In fact, today’s distributional models used for modelling of selectional preference or thematic fit generally base their estimates on syntactic or string co-occurrence models (Baroni and Lenci, 2010; Ritter et al., 2010; S´eaghdha, 2010). The Distributional Memory (DM) model by Baroni and Lenci (2010) is one example of an unsupervised model based on syntactic dependencies, which has been successfully applied to many different distributional similarity tasks, and also has been used in compositional models (Lenci, 2011). While earlier work has shown that syntactic relations and thematic roles are related concepts (Levin, 1993), there are also a large number of cases where thematic roles assigned by a role labeller and their best-matching syntactic relations do not correspond (Palmer et al., 2005). However, it is possible that this non-correspondence is not a problem for estimating typical agents and patients from large amounts of data: agents will most of the time coincide with subjects, and patients will most of the time coincide with syntactic objects. On the other hand, the best resource for estimating thematic fit should be based on labels that most closely correspond to the target task, i.e. semantic role labelling, instead of syntactic parsing. In this paper, we want to test how far a DM trained directly on a role labeller which produces PropBank style semantic annotations can complement the syntax-based DM model on thematic fit tasks, given a similar corpus of training data. We maintain the unsupervised nature of both models by combining their ratings by averaging without any weight estimation (we “guess” 50%) and show that we get an improvement in matching human judgements collected from previous experiments on agent/patient roles, location, and manner roles. We demonstrate that a fully unsupervised model based on a the SENNA role-labeller (Collobert et al., 2011) outperforms a corresponding model based on MaltParser dependencies (DepDM) by a wide margin. Furthermore, we show that the SENNA-based model can almost match B&L’s better performing TypeDM model, which involves hand-crafted rules, and demonstrate that the SENNA-based model makes a contribution over and above the syntactic model in a range of thematic role labelling tasks.","We have constructed a distributional memory based on SENNA-annotated thematic roles and shown an improved correlation with human data when combining it with the high-performing syntax-based TypeDM. We found that, even when built on similar corpora, SRL brings something to the table over and above syntactic parsing. In addition, our SENNA-based DM model was con-structed in a manner roughly equivalent to B&L’s simpler DepDM model, and yet it performs at a level far higher than DepDM on the Padó data set, on its own approaching the performance of TypeDM. It is likely that an SRL-based equivalent to TypeDM would further improve performance, and is thus a possible path for future work. Our work also contributes the first evaluation of structured distributional models of semantics for thematic role plausibility for roles other than agent and patient.",22,Distributional Semantics
66_2014,2014,CLICIT2014166,"Romain Serizel, Diego Giuliani",Deep neural network adaptation for children's and adults' speech recognition,ENG,2,0,0,Fondazione Bruno Kessler,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Trento,"This paper introduces a novel application of the hybrid deep neural net-work (DNN) - hidden Markov model (HMM) approach for automatic speech recognition (ASR) to target groups of speakers of a specific age/gender. We target three speaker groups consisting of children, adult males and adult females, respectively. The group-specific training of DNN is investigated and shown to be not always effective when the amount of training data is limited. To overcome this problem, the recent approach that con-sists in adapting a general DNN to do-main/language specific data is extended to target age/gender groups in the context of hybrid DNN-HMM systems, reducing consistently the phone error rate by 15-20% relative for the three different speaker groups.","Speaker-related acoustic variability is one of the major source of errors in automatic speech recognition. In this paper we cope with age group differences, by considering the relevant case of children versus adults, as well as with male/female differences. Here DNN is used to deal with the acoustic variability induced by age and gender differences. When an ASR system trained on adults’ speech is employed to recognise children’s speech, performance decreases drastically, especially for younger children (Wilpon and Jacobsen, 1996; Das et al., 1998; Claes et al., 1998; Potamianos and Narayanan, 2003; Giuliani and Gerosa, 2003; Gerosa et al., 2007). A number of attempts have been reported in literature to contrast this effect. Most of them try to compensate for spectral differences caused by differences in vocal tract length and shape by warping the frequency axis of the speech power spectrum of each test speaker or transforming acoustic models (Potamianos and Narayanan, 2003; Das et al., 1998; Claes et al., 1998). However, to ensure good recognition performance, age-specific acoustic models trained on speech collected from children of the target age, or group of ages, is usually employed (Wilpon and Jacobsen, 1996; Hagen et al., 2003; Nisimura et al., 2004; Gerosa et al., 2007). Typically, much less training data are available for children than for adults. The use of adults’ speech for reinforcing the training data in the case of a lack of children’s speech was investigated in the past (Wilpon and Jacobsen, 1996; Steidl et al., 2003). However, in order to achieve a recognition performance improvement when training with a mixture of children’s and adults’ speech, speaker normalisation and speaker adaptive training techniques are usually needed (Gerosa et al., 2009). During the past years, DNN has proven to be an effective alternative to HMM - Gaussian mixture modelisation (GMM) based ASR (HMMGMM) (Bourlard and Morgan, 1994; Hinton et al., 2012) obtaining good performance with context dependent hybrid DNN-HMM (Mohamed et al., 2012; Dahl et al., 2012). Capitalising on their good classification and generalisation skills the DNN have been used widely in multi-domain and multi-languages tasks (Sivadas and Hermansky, 2004; Stolcke et al., 2006). The main idea is usually to first exploit a task independent (multi-lingual/multi-domain) corpus and then to use a task specific corpus. One approach consists in using the different corpora at different stages of the DNN training. The task independent corpus is used only for the pretraining (Swietojanski et al., 2012) or for a general first training (Le et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2013) and the task specific corpus is used for the final training/adaptation of the DNN. This paper introduces the use of the DNNHMM approach for phone recognition in age and gender dependent groups, extending the idea introduced in (Yochai and Morgan, 1992) to the DNN context. Three target groups of speakers are considered here, that is children, adult males and adult females. There is only a limited amount of labeled data for such groups. To overcome this problem, a DNN trained on speech data from all the three groups of speakers is adapted to the age/gender group specific corpora. First it is shown that training a DNN only from a group specific corpus is not effective when only limited labeled data is available. Then the method proposed in (Thomas et al., 2013) is adapted to the age/gender specific problem. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the general training and adaptation methods. Experimental setup is described in Section 3 and results are presented in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are provided in Section 5.","In this paper we have investigated the use of the DNN-HMM approach in a phone recognition task targeting three groups of speakers, that is children, adult males and adult females. It has been shown that, in under-resourced condition, group specific training does not necessarily lead to PER improve-ments. To overcome this problem a recent ap-proach, which consists in adapting a task indepen-dent DNN for tandem ASR to domain/language specific data, has been extended to age/gender spe-cific DNN adaptation for DNN-HMM. The DNN-HMM adapted on a low amount of group specific data have been shown to improve the PER by 15-20% relative with respect to the DNN-HMM base-line system trained on speech data from all the three groups of speakers. In this work we have proven the effectiveness of the hybrid DNN-HMM approach when training with limited amount of data and targeting speaker populations of different age/gender. Future work will be devoted to embed the results presented here in a large vocabulary speech recogniser especially targeting under-resourced groups of speakers such as children.",13,Multimodal

The corpus that we will present contains a set of sentences man-ually annotated according to the various aspects of the movie that have been dis-cussed in the sentence and the polarity expressed towards that particular aspect. In this paper we will present the anno-tation guidelines applied, some statistics about the corpus and the preliminary re-sults about the identification of the aspects.","Nowadays, on the Web there is a huge amount of unstructured information about public opinion and it continues growing up rapidly. Analysing the opinions expressed by the users is an important step to evaluate the quality of a product. In this scenario, the tools provided by Sentiment Analy-sis and Opinion Mining are crucial to process this information. In the particular case of movie re-views, we have that the number of reviews that a movie receives on-line grows quickly. Some pop-ular movies can receive hundreds of reviews and, furthermore, many reviews are long and some-times they contain only few sentences expressing the actual opinions. This makes hard for a poten-tial viewer to read them and make an informed decision about whether to watch a movie or not. In the case that one only reads a few reviews, the choice may be biased. The large number of reviews also makes it hard for movie producers to keep track of viewer’s opinions. The recent advances in Sentiment Analysis have shown that coarse overall sentiment scores fails to adequately represent the multiple potential aspects on which an entity can be evaluated (Socher et al., 2013). For example, if we consider the following review from Amazon.com about the movie Inception: “By far one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. Visually stunning and mentally challenging. I would recommend this movie to people who are very deep and can stick with a movie to get the true meaning of the story.” One can see that, even if the review is short, it not only expresses an overall opinion but also contains opinions about other two aspects of the movie: the photography and the story. So, in order to obtain a more detailed sentiment, an analysis that considers different aspects is required. In this work, we present an Italian corpus fo-cused on the domain of movie reviews developed in order to support our ongoing effort for the de-velopment of new models about Sentiment Analy-sis and Aspect Identification in Italian language. The paper is structured as follows. In the Sec-tion 2 we present the motivations that led us to the creation of a new corpus and a short survey about related resources that already exist. Section 3 de-scribes the guideline used to annotate the corpora, while Section 4 presents some statistical informa-tion about it. In section 5 we present some prelimi-nary experiments about the identification of the as-pects. Finally, in section 6 some conclusions will be offered.","We introduced an Italian corpus of sentences ex-tracted by movie reviews.

The objective that led its constitution was to reveal the lack of a corpus of Italian reference. This article describes the criteria on the basis of its com-position, its structure in 10 sections and sub-sections and its multi-level notification, with its respective assessment.","The Perugia Corpus (PEC) is a reference corpus of contemporary Italian, written and spoken1; it consists of over 26 million words, distributed in 10 different sections, corresponding to the same text genres, and equipped with a multi-level annotation. The PEC intends to reveal the lack of a reference corpus (written and spoken), which has so far suffered by Italian studies. Because of its nature as a reference resource (EAGLES, 1996), the PEC is designed to provide as general language information as possible about Italian and its main written and spoken varieties. The philosophy that led the composition of the PEC is therefore radically different from that which is at the basis of some web corpora (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006; Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003) of the Italian of last generation such as Pais√† (Lyding et al., 2014), itWac (Baroni and Kilgarriff, 2006) or itTenTen (Jakub' ek et al., 2013), but also from that of the less recent corpora such as Republic (Baroni et al., 2004) and CORIS/CODIS (Rossini Favretti et al., 2002): the choice was in fact that the differentiation of the generials of the text, including the spoken, to the extent of the dimensions of the corpus. In addition, it focused on re-use of existing and available resources (Zampolli, 1991), but sometimes dispersed and difficult to consult; to them were added new data, gathered with the double purpose of filling emptiness in which data was not available for the Italian, and updating existing, but already dated resources. The PEC can therefore be considered a reference corpus √âlow cost√ì, of contained dimensions but with a good representativity of the various written and spoken varieties of Italian. The dimensions contained in the PEC also have two advantages: they allow to manage, in the process of questioning, more managerial results (Hundt and Leech, 2012), and allow to obtain good accuracy in the announcement (see par. 3.2 and 2.","The PEC represents the first reference corpus of contemporary Italian written and spoken; in its composition was privileged the differentiation of text genres, also spoken, compared to the width of dimensions. Realized with limited resources and in short periods of time, using, where possible, existing language resources, the PEC constitutes a low-cost compromise between the creation of new resources and the re-use of existing resources. The PEC interrogation takes place through the CWB interface and the Corpus Query Processor (Evert and Hardie, 2011), which allows you to search for words, sequences of words and notes; it is planned the creation of a network interface via CQPweb (Hardie, 2012), accessible to the public.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We will propose a kernel-based formulation of this classifier that is able to compete with a state-of-the-art machine learning methods when clas-sifying instances from two hard artificial problems and two real tasks taken from the speech processing domain.,"Quantum Mechanics Theory (QMT) is one of the most successful theory in modern science. Despite its ability to properly describe most natural phenomena in the physics realm, the attempts to prove its effectiveness in other domains remain quite limited. Only in recent years some scholars tried to embody principles derived from QMT into their specific fields. This connection has been actively studied, for example, by the Information Retrieval community (Zuccon et al., 2009; Melucci, van Rijsbergen, 2011; Gonz`alez, Caicedo, 2011) and in the domain of cognitive sciences and decision making (Busemeyer, Bruza, 2012). Also the NLP community started to look at QMT with interest and some studies using it have already been presented (Blacoe et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013). This paper presents work in progress on the development of a new classifier based on Quantum Probability Theory. Starting from the work presented in (Liu et al., 2013) we will show all the limits of this simple quantum classifier and propose a new kernel-based formulation able to solve most of its problems and able to compete with a state-of-the-art classifier, namely Support Vector Machines, when classifying instances from two hard artificial problems and two real tasks taken from speech processing domain.","This paper presented a first attempt to produce a general purpose classifier based on Quantum Probability Theory. Considering the early experiments from (Liu et al., 2013), KQC is more powerful and gains better performance. The results obtained on our experiments are quite encouraging and we are tempted to answer ‘yes’ to the question presented in the paper title. This is a work in progress and the KQC is not free from problems. Despite its potential to outperform SVM using linear kernels, it is very complex to determine a tradeoff between the definition of decision boundaries with maximum margins and to maximise the classifier generalisation abilities. A long optimisation process on the training set maximise the margins between classes but could potentially lead to poor generalisations on new data. Making more experiments and evaluations in that directions is one of our future plans.",13,Multimodal

The task of under-standing emotional similarities between different topics is crucial, for example, in analyzing the Social TV landscape. A measure of how much two audiences share the same feelings is required, but also a sound and compact representation of these similarities. After evaluating differ-ent multivariate approaches, we achieved these goals by adapting Multiple Corre-spondence Analysis (MCA) techniques to our data. In this paper we provide back-ground information and methodological reasons to our choice. We also provide an example of Social TV analysis, performed on Twitter data collected between October 2013 and February 2014.","Classification of documents based on topics of interest is a popular NLP research area; see, for example, Hamamoto et al. (2005). Another important subject, especially in the context of Web 2.0 and social media, is the sentiment analysis, mainly meant to detect polarities of expressions and opinions (Liu, 2012). A sentiment analysis task which has seen less contributions, but of growing popularity, is the study of emotions (Wiebe et al., 2005), which requires introducing and analyzing multiple variables (appropriate ”emotional dimensions”) potentially correlated. This is especially important in the study of the so-called Social TV (Cosenza, 2012): people can share their TV experience with other viewers on social media using smartphones and tablets. We define the empirical distribution of different emotions among viewers of a specific TV show as its emotional profile. Comparing at the same time the emotional profiles of several formats requires appropriate descriptive statistical techniques. During the research we conducted, we evaluated and selected geometrical methods that satisfy these requirements and provide an easy to understand and coherent representation of the results. The methods we used can be applied to any dataset of documents classified based on topics and emotions; they also represent a potential tool for the quantitative analysis of any NLP annotated data. We used the Blogmeter platform1 to download and process textual contents from social networks (Bolioli et al., 2013). Topics correspond to TV programs discussed on Twitter. Nine emotions are detected: the basic six according to Ekman (Ekman, 1972) (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise), love (a primary one in Parrot’s classification) and like/dislike expressions, quite common on Twitter.","By applying carefully chosen multivariate statistical techniques, we have shown how to represent and highlight important emotional relations between topics. Further results in the MCA field can be experimented on datasets similar to the ones we used. For example, additional information about opinion polarity and document authors (such as Twitter users) could be incorporated in the analysis. The geometric approach to MCA (Le Roux and Rouanet, 2004) could be interesting to study in greater detail the clouds of impressions and documents (J and D matrices); authors could also be considered as mean points of well-defined subclouds.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We compare gold standard annotations against the output of the mod-ules based on the state-of-the-art NLP for Italian. Our experiments suggest the most promising direction for future work on coreference in Italian: we show that, while automatic mention description affects the performance only mildly, the mention de-tection module plays a crucial role for the end-to-end coreference performance. We also show that, while a considerable number of mentions in Italian are zero pronouns, their omission doesn’t affect a general-purpose coreference resolver, sug-gesting that more specialized algorithms are needed for this subtask.","Coreference Resolution is an important prerequisite for a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, in particular, for Information Extraction and Question Answering, Machine Translation or Single-document Summarization. It is, however, a challenging task, involving complex inference over heterogeneous linguistic cues. Several highperformance coreference resolvers have been proposed recently in the context of the CoNLL-2011 and CoNLL-2012 shared tasks (Pradhan et al., 2011; Pradhan et al., 2012). These systems, however, are engineered to process English documents and cannot be directly applied to other languages: while the CoNLL-2012 shared task includes Arabic and Chinese datasets, most participants have not investigated any language-specific approaches and have relied on the same universal algorithm, retraining it for particular corpora. To our knowledge, only very few systems have been proposed so far to provide end-to-end coreference resolution in Italian. In the context of the SemEval-2010 shared task (Recasens et al., 2010), four systems have attempted Italian coreference. Among these toolkits, only BART relied on any language-specific solutions at this stage (Broscheit et al., 2010; Poesio et al., 2010). The TANL system, however, was enhanced with languagespecific information and integrated into the University of Pisa Italian pipeline later on (Attardi et al., 2012). At Evalita 2009 and 2011, different variants of coreference resolution were proposed as shared tasks (Lenzi and Sprugnoli, 2009; Uryupina and Poesio, 2012), in both cases, only one participant managed to submit the final run. One of the bottlenecks in creating highperformance coreference resolvers lies in the complexity of their architecture. Coreference is a deep linguistic phenomenon and state-of-the-art systems incorporate multiple modules for various related subtasks. Even creating a baseline endto- end resolver is therefore a difficult engineering task. Going beyond the baseline is even more challenging, since it is generally unclear how different types of errors might affect the overall performance level. This paper focuses on systematic evaluation of different sub-modules of a coreference resolver to provide a better understanding of their impact on the system’s performance and thus suggest more promising venues for future research. Starting with a gold pipeline, we gradually replace its components with automatic modules, assessing the impact. The ultimate goal of our study is to boost the performance level for Italian. We are focusing on improving the languagespecific representation, leaving aside any comparison between coreference models (for example, mention-pair vs. mention-entity vs. graph-based).","In this paper, we have attempted an extensive evaluation of the impact of two language-specific components on the performance of a coreference resolver for Italian. We show that the mention extraction module plays a crucial role, while the contribution of the mention description model, while still important, is much less pronounced. This suggests that the mention extraction subtask should be in the primary focus at the beginning of the language-specific research on coreference. Our future work in this direction includes developing a robust statistical mention detector for Italian based on parse trees. We also show that zero pronouns can not be handled by a general-purpose coreference resolver and should therefore be addressed by a separate system, combining their extraction and resolution. Finally, our study has not addressed the last language-specific component of the coreference pipeline, the feature extraction module. Its performance cannot be assessed via a comparison with an oracle since there are no perfect gold features. In the future,we plan to evaluate the impact of this component by comparing different feature sets, engineered both manually and automatically.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

However, tweets are plunged into streams of posts, thus making available a wider context. The contribu-tion of this information has been recently investigated for the English language by modeling the polarity detection as a se-quential classification task over streams of tweets (Vanzo et al., 2014). Here, we want to verify the applicability of this method even for a morphological richer language, i.e. Italian.","Web 2.0 and Social Networks allow users to write about their life and personal experiences. This huge amount of data is crucial in the study of the interactions and dynamics of subjectivity on the Web. Sentiment Analysis (SA) is the computational study and automatic recognition of opinions and sentiments. Twitter is a microblogging service that counts about a billion of active users. In Twitter, SA is traditionally treated as any other text classification task, as proved by most systems participating to the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter task in SemEval-2013 (Nakov et al., 2013). A Machine Learning (ML) setting allows to induce detection functions from real world labeled examples. However, the shortness of the message and the resulting semantic ambiguity represent a critical limitation, thus making the task very challenging. Let us consider the following message between two users: Benji: @Holly sono completamente d’accordo con te The tweet sounds like to be a reply to the previous one. Notice how no lexical or syntactic property allows to determine the polarity. Let’s look now at the entire conversation: Benji : @Holly con un #RigoreAl90 vinci facile!! Holly : @Benji Lui vince sempre per`o :) accanto a chiunque.. Nessuno regge il confronto! Benji : @Holly sono completamente d’accordo con te The first is clearly a positive tweet, followed by a positive one that makes the third positive as well. Thus, through the conversation we can disambiguate even a very short message. We want to leverage on this to define a context-sensitive SA model for the Italian language, in line with (Vanzo et al., 2014). The polarity detection of a tweet is modeled as a sequential classification task through the SVMhmm learning algorithm (Altun et al., 2003), as it allows to classify an instance (i.e. a tweet) within an entire sequence. First experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed sequential tagging approach combined with the adopted contextual information even in the Italian language. A survey of the existing approaches is presented in Section 2. Then, Section 3 provides an account of the context-based model. The experimental evaluation is presented in Section 4.","In this work, the role of contextual information in supervised Sentiment Analysis over Twitter is in-vestigated for the Italian language. Experimental results confirm the empirical findings presented in (Vanzo et al., 2014) for the English language. Al-though the size of the involved dataset is still lim-ited, i.e. about 1,400 tweets, the importance of contextual information is emphasized within the considered markovian approach: it is able to take advantage of the dependencies that exist between different tweets in a conversation. The approach is also largely applicable as all experiments have been carried out without the use of any manual coded resource, but mainly exploiting unannotated material within the distributional method. A larger experiment, eventually on an oversized dataset, such as SentiTUT4, will be carried out.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Even if attempts of standardization are being developed, discordance points are still present. In this paper we consider a problematic semantic role, the Instrument role, which presents differences in definition and causes prob-lems of attribution. Particularly, it is not clear whether to assign this role to inani-mate entities occurring as subjects or not. This problem is especially relevant 1- be-cause of its treatment in practical annota-tion and semantic role labeling, 2- because it affects the whole definition of seman-tic roles. We propose arguments to sustain that inanimate nouns denoting instruments in subject positions are not instantiations of Instrument role, but are Cause, Agent or Theme. Ambiguities in the annotation of these cases are due to confusion between semantic roles and ontological types.","Semantically annotated resources have become widely used and requested in the field of Natural Language Processing, growing as a productive research area. This trend can be confirmed by looking at the repeated attempts in the implementation of annotated resources (FrameNet, VerbNet, Propbank, SALSA, LIRICS, SensoComune) and in the task of automatic Semantic Role Labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002, Surdeanu et al. 2007, M`arquez et al. 2008, Lang and Lapata 2010, Titov and Klementiev 2012 among others). Since their first introduction by Fillmore (1967), semantic roles have been described and defined in many different ways, with different sets and different level of granularity - from macro-roles (Dowty 1991) to frame-specific ones (Fillmore et al. 2002). In order to reach a common standard of number and definition, the LIRICS (Linguistic Infrastructure for Interoperable ResourCes and Systems) project has recently evaluated several approaches for semantic role annotation and proposed an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) ratified standard that enables the exchange and reuse of (multilingual) language resources. In this paper we examine some problematic issues in semantic role attribution. We will highlight a case, the Instrument role, whose definition and designation should be, in our opinion, reconsidered. The topic is particularly relevant since there is difference in its treatment in different lexical resources and since the theoretical debate is still lively. Moreover, this matter highlights aspects of the nature of semantic roles, relevant both for their theoretical definition and for practical annotation, such as the difference between semantic roles and ontological types. The former refer to the role of participants in the particular event described by the linguistic utterance, the latter to the inherent properties of the entity. We argue that this is a main point in the annotation, because, even in the recent past, roles have been frequently tagged according to the internal properties of the entities involved, not, as it should be, because of their role in the particular event described. This analysis arose from the first step of the implementation of the Senso Comune resource (Vetere et al. 2012). With the aim to provide it with semantic roles, a first annotation experiment was conducted to check the reliability of the set and the annotation procedure (Jeˇzek et al. 2014). The dataset was composed of 66 examples without disambiguation, 3 for 22 target verbs, and it was annotated for semantic roles by 8 annotators. They were instructed with a guideline in which a set of 24 coarse-grained roles was defined, with examples and a taxonomy. During the evaluation process, the major cases of disagreement were highlighted. The present study is based on the evidence coming from these data: the Instrument role caused several misunderstandings (see also Varvara 2013). Nevertheless, our analysis will look primarily at examples from literature and other resources in order to rethink this role and to reach a standardization. We propose to consider what are called instrument subjects (Alexiadou and Sch¨afer 2006) as instances of three different roles (Cause, Agent and Theme) rather than as Instrument.","In this paper we have shown how theoretical and data analysis can be mutually improved by each other. Literature has offered critical discussion about the Instrument role and the case of instru-ment subjects, a discussion that can be useful for the definition and annotation of semantic roles in the implementation of lexical resources. More-over, analysis of annotated data can reveal fal-lacies in the reliability of the set, coming back from application to theoretical topics. At last, our study highlights the importance of distinguishing between semantic roles - relational notions be-longing to the level of linguistic representation -and ontological types, which refer to internal qual-ities of real-world entities. We believe that this topic, because of its importance, should be taken into consideration for a more complete treatment in future work.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

First, we will show the basic linguistic resources: dictionaries, inflectional and derivational grammars, syntactic gram-mars. Secondly, we will show some results of the application of such linguistic resources: the annotation of date/time patterns, the processing of idioms, the extraction and the annotation of transfer predicates.","NooJ is a development environment used to construct large-coverage formalized descriptions of natural languages, and apply them to corpora, in real time. NooJ, whose author is Max Silberztein (Silberztein 2003-), is a knowledge-based system that makes use of huge linguistic resources. Dictionaries, combined with morphosyntactic grammars, are the basic linguistic resources without which it would be impossible to perform a text analysis. The system includes various modules for more than twenty languages, among them Italian (.nooj4nlp.net). Most of the Italian linguistic resources are completely new. The goal of the NooJ project is twofold: to provide tools allowing linguists to implement exhaustive descriptions of languages, and to design a system which processes texts in natural language (see Silberztein 2014). NooJ consists of higher and higher linguistics levels: tokenization, morphological analysis, disambiguation, named entity recognition, syntactic parsing1. Unlike other systems, for example TreeTagger, developed by Helmut Schmidt (1995) 2 , NooJ is not a tagger, but the user can freely build disambiguation grammars and apply them to texts. Section 2 describes the Italian dictionary and the inflectional/derivational grammars associated with it. Section 3 shows the extraction of date/time patterns, section 4 the parsing of idioms. Section 5 describes the XML annotation and extraction of transfer predicates.","The application of the Italian module to a corpus of 100MB (La Stampa 1998) produced the following results: 33,866.028 tokens, 26,785.331 word forms. The unknown tokens are loan words, typos, acronyms, alterates8. The Italian module consists of exhaustive dictionaries/ grammars formally coded and manually built on those distributional and morphosyntactic principles as defined within the Lexicon- Grammar framework. Such a lingware (a) constitutes an invaluable linguistic resource because of the linguistic precision and complexity of dictionaries/grammars, (b) can be exploited by the symbolic as well as the hybrid approach to Natural Language Processing. The linguistic approach to NLP still constitutes a valid alternative to the statistical method that requires the (not always reliable) annotation of large corpora. If the annotated data contain errors, those systems based on them will produce inaccurate results. Moreover, corpora are never exhaustive descriptions of any language. On the other hand, formalized dictionaries/ grammars can be enriched, corrected and maintained very easily. Silberztein (2014) contains a detailed discussion on the limits, errors and naïveté of the statistical approach to NLP. The Italian module for NooJ constituted the basis of several research projects such as Elia et al. (2013), Monti et al. (2013), di Buono et al. (2014), Maisto et al. (2014). Therefore, it has been tested, verified and validated. The results constitute the basis for the updating of the module itself. Ultimately, the lexical resources of the Italian module can be easily exported into any format usable by other systems.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Secondly, we extract citation from footnotes, with plain text as input. Lastly, we deal at the same time with two different kind of citations: to primary and to secondary sources. A primary source is a documentary evidence used to support a claim, a secondary source is a scholarly publication AUTHOR. In order to solve this problem, we propose a pipeline of classifiers dealing with citation detection, extraction and parsing. The paper is organised as follows: a state of the art in Section 2 is followed by a methodological section explaining the pipeline and applied computational tools. A section on experiments follows, conclusions and future steps close the paper.","We presented a pipeline for recognizing and parsing citations to primary and secondary sources from historiography on Venice, with a case study on the Archivio Veneto journal. A first filtering step allows us to detect text blocks likely to contain citations, usually footnotes, by a SVM classifier trained on a simple set of morphological features. We then detect citation boundaries and macro-categories (to primary and secondary sources) using more rich features and CRFs. The last step in our pipeline is the fine-grained parsing of each extracted citation, in order to prepare them for further processing and analysis. In the future we plan to design more advanced feature sets, first of all considering text format features. Secondly, we will implement the next package of our chain: an error-tolerant normalizer which will uniform all citations to the same primary or secondary source within a publication, as a means to minimise the impact of classification errors during previous steps.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We find that the most effective approach is based on clustering of unlabeled data. We also show that combining different approaches does not further improve performance. Thus, POS tagging of social media data remains a challenging problem.","Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging of social media data is still challenging. Instead of tagging accuracies in the high nineties on newswire data, on social media we observe significantly lower numbers. This performance drop is mainly caused by the high number of out-of-vocabulary words in social media, as authors neglect orthographic rules (Eisenstein, 2013). However, special syntax in social media also plays a role, as e.g. pronouns at the beginning of sentence are often omitted like in “went to the gym” where the pronoun ’I’ is implicated (Ritter et al., 2011). To make matters worse, existing corpora with PoS annotated social media data are rather small, which has led to a wide range of domain adaptation approaches being explored in the literature. There are two main paradigms: First, adding more labeled training data by adding foreign or machine-generated data (Daumé III, 2007; Ritter et al., 2011). Second, incorporating external knowledge or guiding the machine learning algorithm to extract more knowledge from the existing data (Ritter et al., 2011; Owoputi et al., 2013). The first strategy affects from which data is learned, the second one what is learned. Using more training data Usually there is only little PoS annotated data from the social media domain, so just using re-training on domain-specific data does not suffice for good performance. Mixed re-training adds additional annotated text from foreign domains to the training data. In case there is much more foreign data than social media data, Oversampling (Daumé III, 2007) can be used to adjust for the difference in size. Finally, Voting can be used to provide more social media training data by relying on multiple already existing taggers. Using more knowledge Instead of adding more training data, we can also make better use of the existing data in order to lower the out-ofvocabulary rate. PoS dictionaries provide for instance information about the most frequent tag of a word. Another approach is clustering which group words according to their distributional similarity (Ritter et al., 2011). In this paper, we evaluate the potential of each approach for solving the task.","In this paper, we analyzed domain adaptation approaches for improving PoS tagging on social media text. We confirm that adding more manually annotated in-domain data is highly effective, but annotation costs might often prevent application of this strategy. Adding more out-domain training data or machine-tagged data is less effective than adding more external knowledge in our experiments. We find that clustering is the most effective individual approach. However, clustering based on very large corpora did not further increase accuracy. As combination of strategies did only yield minor improvements, clustering seems to dominate the other strategies.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

In this paper, we consider three English learner corpora and one new, presumably more difficult, scientific corpus. We find that the scientific corpus is only about as hard to model as a less-controlled learner corpus, but cannot profit as much from corpus combination via domain adaptation. We show that this is related to an inherent topic bias in the scientific corpus: researchers from different countries tend to work on different topics.","Native Language Identification (NLI) is the task of recognizing an author's native language (L1) from text written in a second language (L2). NLI is important for applications such as the detection of phishing attacks AUTHOR or data collection for the study of L2 acquisition AUTHOR. State-of-the-art methods couch NLI as a classification task, where the classes are the L1 of the author and the features are supposed to model the effects of the author's L1 on L2 (language transfer). Such features may be of varying linguistic sophistication, from function words and structural features AUTHOR on one side to N-grams over characters, words and POS tags AUTHOR on the other side. Like in many NLP tasks, there are few large datasets for NLI. Furthermore, it is often unclear how well the models really capture the desired language transfer properties rather than topics. The widely-used International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE, AUTHOR) has been claimed to suffer from a topic bias AUTHOR: Authors with the same L1 prefer certain topics, potentially due to the corpus collection strategy (from a small set of language courses). As a result, AUTHOR question the generalization of NLI models to other corpora and propose the use of domain adaptation. In contrast, AUTHOR report their ICLE-trained models to perform well on other learner corpora. This paper extends the focus to a novel corpus type, non-native scientific texts from the ACL Anthology. These are substantially different from learner corpora: (a) most authors have a good working knowledge of English; and (b) due to the conventions of the domain, terminology and structure are highly standardized AUTHOR. A priori, we would believe that NLI on the ACL corpus is substantially more difficult. Our results show, however, that the differences between the ACL corpus and the various learner corpora are more subtle: The ACL corpus is about as difficult to model as some learner corpora. However, generalization to the ACL corpus is more difficult, due to its idiosyncratic topic biases.","This study investigated the generalizability of NLI models across learner corpora and a novel corpus of scientific ACL documents. We found that generalizability is directly tied to corpus properties: well-controlled learner corpora (TOEFL-11, ICLE) generalize well to one another AUTHOR. Together with the minor effect on performance of removing topic-related features, we conclude that topic bias within a similar text type does not greatly affect generalization. At the same time, ``classical'' learner corpora do not generalize well to less-controlled learner corpora (Lang-8) or scientific corpora (ACL). Lang-8 and ACL show comparable performance, which seems surprising given the small size of the ACL corpus and its quite different nature. Our analysis shows that the ACL corpus exhibits an idiosyncratic topic bias: scientists from different countries work on different topics, which is reflected in the models. As a result, the improvements that Lang-8 can derive from domain adaptation techniques carry over to the ACL corpus only to a limited extent. Nevertheless, the use of mSDA can halve the amount of ACL data necessary for the same performance, which is a promising result regarding the generalization to other low-resource domains.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

To answer this question, we collected transcriptions from face to face multi-party conversations between 11 participants, and retrieved their Facebook threads. We automatically annotated the psycholinguistic dimensions in the two domains by means of the LIWC dictionary, and we performed correlation analysis. Results show that some Facebook dimensions, such as “likes” and shares, have a counterpart in face to face communication, in particular the number of questions and the length of statements. The corpus we collected has been anonymized and is available for research purposes.","In recent years we had great advancements in the analysis of communication, in face to face meetings as well as in Online Social Networks (OSN) (Boyd and Ellison, 2007). For example, resources for computational psycholinguistics like the Linguistic Enquiry Word Count (LIWC) (Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010), have been applied to OSN like Facebook and Twitter for personality recognition tasks (Golbeck et al., 2011) (Schwartz et al., 2013) (Celli and Polonio, 2013) (Quercia et al., 2011). Interesting psychological research analyzed the motivations behind OSN usage (Gosling et al., 2011) (Seidman, 2013) and whether user profiles in OSN reflect acual personaliy or a selfidealization (Back et al., 2010). Also Conversation Analysis (CA) of face to face meetings, that has a long history dating back to the ’70s (Sacks et al., 1974), has taken advantage of computational techniques, addressing detection of consensus in business meetings (Pianesi et al., 2007), multimodal personality recognition (Pianesi et al., 2008) and dectection of conflicts from speech (Kim et al., 2012). In this paper we make a comparison of the linguistic behaviour of OSN users both online and in face to face meetings. To do so, we collected Facebook data from 11 volunteer users, who participated to an experimental setting where we recorded face to face multiparty conversations of their meetings. Our goal is to discover relationships between a rich set of psycholinguistic dimensions (Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010) extracted from Facebook metadata and meeting transcriptions. Our contributions to the research in the fields on Conversation Analysis and Social Network Analysis are: the release of a corpus of speech transcriptions aligned to Facebook data in Italian and the analysis of correlations between psycholinguistic dimensions in the two settings. The paper is structured as follows: in section 2 we describe the corpora and the data collection, in section 3 we explain the method adopted and report the results, in section 4 we draw some conclusions.","In this paper, we attempted to analyse the correlations between psycholinguistic dimensions observed in Facebook and face to face meetings. We found that the type of words significantly correlated to both settings are related to strong emotions (anger and anxiety), We suggest that these are linguistic dimensions difficult to control and tend to be constant in different settings. Crucially, we also found that likes received on Facebook are correlated to the tendency to ask questions in meetings. Literature on impression formation/management report that people with high self-esteem in meetings will elicit self-esteem enhancing reactions from others (Hass, 1981). This could explain the link between the tendency to ask questions in meetings with unknown people and the tendency to post contents that elicit likes in Facebook. Moreover, the tendency to ask questions in spoken conversations is correlated to observed emotional stability (Mairesse et al., 2007) and that emotionally stable users in Twitter tend to have more replies in conversations than neurotic users (Celli and Rossi, 2012). We suggest that the correlation we found can be partially explained by these two privious findings. Another very interesting finding is that the tendency to be reshared on Facebook correlates to the tendency to speak a lot in face to face meetings. Again, literature about impression formation/management can explain this, because people with high self-esteem tend to engage people and to speak a lot, while people adopting defensive strategies tend to be assertive less argumentative. In linguistics it is an open debate whether virality depends from the influence of the source (Zaman et al., 2010) or the content of message being shared (Guerini et al., 2011) (Suh et al., 2010). In particular, the content that evokes higharousal positive (amusement) or negative (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral, while content that evokes low arousal emotions (sadness) is less viral (Berger and Milkman, 2012). Given that the tendency to express both positive and negative feelings and emotions in spoken conversations is a feature of extraversion (Mairesse et al., 2007), and that literature in psychology links the tendency to speak a lot to extraversion (Gill and Oberlander, 2002), observed neuroticism (Mairesse et al., 2007) and dominance (Bee et al., 2010). we suggest that the correlation between long turns in meetings and highly shared contents in Facebook may be due to extraversion, dominance and high self-esteem. We are going to release the dataset we collected on demand.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

Given a set of text sentences, a word co-occurrence graph is derived and a distance based on Jaccard index is defined on it; subsequently, the new distance is used to cluster the neighbour nodes of ambiguous terms using the concept of ``gangplanks'' as edges that separate denser regions (``islands'') in the graph. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a real data set, showing promising performance in Word Sense Discrimination.","Word Sense Disambiguation is a challenging research task in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. The main reasons behind the difficulties of this task are ambiguity and arbitrariness of human language: just depending on its context, the same term can assume different interpretations, or senses, in an unpredictable manner. In the last decade, three main research directions have been investigated AUTHOR: 1) supervised AUTHOR, 2) knowledge-based AUTHOR and 3) unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation AUTHOR, where the last approach is better defined as ``induction'' or ``discrimination''. In this paper we focus on the automatic discovery of senses from raw text, by pursuing an unsupervised Word Sense Discrimination paradigm. We are interested in the development of a method that can be generally independent from the register or the linguistic well-formedness of a text document, and, given an adequate pre-processing step, from language. Among the many unsupervised research directions, i.e. context clustering AUTHOR, word clustering AUTHOR, probabilistic clustering AUTHOR and co-occurrence graph clustering AUTHOR , we committed to the last one, based on the assumption that word co-occurrence graphs can reveal local structural properties tied to the different senses a word might assume in different contexts. Given a global word co-occurrence graph, the main goal is to exploit the subgraph induced by the neighbourhood of the word to be disambiguated (a ``word cloud''). There, we define separator edges (``gangplanks'') and use them as the means to cluster the word cloud: the fundamental assumption is that, in the end, every cluster will correspond to a different sense of the word. The paper is organized as follows. In section grafigrafigrafi we explain how we build our co-occurrence graph and word clouds by means of a weighted Jaccard distance. In section clasteri we describe the gangplank algorithm. In section tuitti we present the algorithm's results on our data set and their evaluation. In section parenti we give a brief overview on related work and section fine presents some short conclusions.","The main challenge we encountered for our word sense discrimination algorithm was the difficulty of handling a small-world graph. Apart from that, we have to notice that word clustering just represents the last step of a process that starts with pre-processing and tokenization of a text, which are both mostly of supervised nature. Our future goals will be to investigate the relations between text pre-processing and clustering results, and how to render the whole process completely unsupervised.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The English corpus was created and annotated manually within the NewsReader project,} whose goal is to build a multilingual system able to reconstruct storylines across news articles in order to provide policy and decision makers with an overview of what happened, to whom, when, and where. Semantic annotations in the NewsReader English Wikinews corpus span over multiple levels, including both intra-document annotation (entities, events, temporal information, semantic roles, and event and entity coreference) and cross-document annotation (event and entity coreference). As manual annotation is a very expensive and time-consuming task, we devised a procedure to automatically project the annotations already available in the English texts onto the Italian translations, based on the manual alignment of the annotated elements in the two languages. The English corpus, taken directly from Wikinews, together with WItaC, being its translation, ensures access to non-copyrighted articles for the evaluation of the NewsReader system and the possibility of comparing results in the two languages at a finegrained level. WItaC aims at being a reference for the evaluation of storylines reconstruction, a task requiring several subtasks, e.g. semantic role labeling (SRL) and event coreference. In addition, it is part of a cross-lingually annotated corpus, thus enabling for experiments across different languages. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. We review related work in Section~sec:soa. In Section~sec:annotEnglish we present the annotations available in the English corpus used as the source for the projection of the annotation. In Section 2 we detail some adaptations of the guidelines specific for Italian. In Sections3 and 4 we describe the annotation process and the resulting WItaC corpus. Finally, we conclude presenting some future work.","We have presented WItaC, a new corpus consisting of Italian translations of English texts annotated using a cross-lingual projection method. We acknowledge some influence of English in the translated texts (for instance, we noticed an above-average occurrence of noun modifiers, as in “dipendenti Airbus”) and in the annotation (for instance, annotators might have been influenced by English in the identification of light verb constructions in the Italian corpus). On the other hand, this method enabled us not only to considerably reduce the annotation effort, but also to add a new cross-lingual level to the NewsReader corpus; in fact, we now have two annotated corpora, in English and Italian, in which entity and event instances (in total, over 1,600) are shared. In the short-term we plan to manually revise the projected relations and add the language-specific attributes. We also plan to use the corpus as a dataset for a shared evaluation task and afterwards we will make it freely available from the website of the HLT-NLP group at FBK6 and from the website of the NewsReader project.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In particular, the linking experiment has as its object the videos of the ontology of the IMAGACT action and the respective verbal lexical entries of BabelNet. The task was executed through an algorithm that operates on the basis of the lexical information present in the two resources. Linking results show that it is possible to make an extensive link between the two ontologies. Such a link is desirable in the sense of providing a rich and multimedia database for complex deambiguation tasks of the reference of the action verbs and automatic and assisted translation of the phrases containing them.","Ontologies are widely used tools to represent linguistic resources on the web and make them exploitable by methods of automatic processing of natural language. The availability of shared formal languages, such as RDF and OWL, and the development of high-level ontologies, such as lemon (McCrae et al., 2011), are leading to a unified methodology for publishing language resources in the form of open data2. The representation of information through ontologies is not sufficient for the construction of the semantic network that is the basis of the new web paradigms. The interconnection of information and, consequently, the mapping and linking between different ontologies become essential aspects for access to knowledge and its enrichment, as evidenced by the increasing development of research in this field (Otero-Cerdeira et al., 2015). The need to maximize connections between different resources must be compared with the fact that each ontology is built with different criteria, which refer to different theoretical frameworks. In this context the instance matching becomes particularly relevant, since it allows to connect resources without mapping ontological entities (Castano et al., 2008; Nath et al., 2014). In this article we present a hypothesis of connection between two linguistic ontology, BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012a) and IMAGACT (Moneglia et al., 2014a), both multimedia, multilingual and exploitable for translation and disambiguation tasks (Moro and Navigli, 2015; Russo et al., 2013; Moneglia, 2014). The connection between ontologies takes place through the visual component of IMAGACT, i.e. the representation of actions by means of prototype scenes.","Although a fine-tuning of the parameters has not yet been done (for which a wider set test is required), the good results obtained by this experiment open the possibility of connecting the two ontologies through the scenes of IMAGACT, in order to enrich both resources. On the one hand, IMAGACT's videos could represent BS's ational concepts; on the other hand, IMAGACT would be enriched with BabelNet's translation information. Moreover, from Babelfy's observation (Moro et al., 2014), the word sense engine disambiguation and entity linking derived from BabelNet, it became apparent that the linking hypothesis proposed here would have a significant impact on the expressiveness of the visual representation of the sentences, with the association of images with names and videos with verbs. Finally, it is important to note that both BabelNet and IMAGACT are expanding resources: since algorithms exploit translation equivalents, the results can be more precise as the languages and the terms considered increase.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

It shows an example of the issues encountered in accommodating information of an existent corpus into IMDI metadata structure. Finally, it provides preliminary reflections on CMDI: a component-based metadata format.","Once a Language Resource (LR) exists it should be used, and this entails several problems. First of all it must be available to the public – which may be the academic community, but also industry or institutions – and, given that producing a LR is an expensive task, it would be ideal that a LR could be exploited beyond the originally intended public. The re-usability of a LR is possible provided that it is conceived following shared standards for formats, tagging and metadata. In this paper I focus on metadata structures, in particular I introduce a collection of spoken data (the Bolzano/Bozen Corpus) and I show the problems encountered in fitting the information available about the speakers sampled in the data in IMDI metadata structure. The paper aims at providing an example of how flexible are the considered metadata structures in accommodating information of existent collections of data and in adapting to the needs of the researcher in sociolinguistics.","In this paper, I have shown an example of the difficulty of using a metadata structure to accommodate information on speaker’s linguistic background. I have taken into account the case of Bolzano Bozen Corpus and two sociolinguistically oriented projects (KOMMA, Kontatto) hosted on The Language Archive. IMDI, the former standard of TLA, is now an outdated tool and is too rigid to adapt to specific purposes. The new standard CMDI provides huge possibilities to the research community to define metadata formats tailored on specific needs. However CMDI does not provide until now satisfactory profiles and components for sociolinguistic studies, especially as far as background information about the speaker is concerned. Furthermore, direct contribution to CMDI components is restricted to CLARIN centres and in some crucial cases even categories available in CMDI are unsatisfactory and must be proposed to the relevant (and closed) DCR. The case I have proposed shows on the one hand the possibilities of CMDI. However, on the other hand, the difficulty to contribute to CMDI profiles and components from outside CLARIN may lead to the uncomfortable condition of having huge amounts of data with unsatisfactory metadata, which have low possibilities to be re-used, failing one of the main objectives of a standardisation initiative.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

NSUs are utterances that do not have a complete sentential form but convey a full clausal meaning given the dialogue context. We extend the approach of Fernández et al. (2007), which provide a taxonomy of NSUs and a small annotated corpus extracted from dialogue transcripts. This paper demonstrates how the combination of new linguistic features and active learning techniques can mitigate the scarcity of labelled data. The results show a significant improvement in the classification accuracy over the state-of-the-art","In dialogue, utterances do not always take the form of complete, well-formed sentences with a subject, a verb and complements. Many utterances – often called non-sentential utterances, or NSUs for short – are fragmentary and lack an overt predicate. Consider the following examples from the British National Corpus: A: How do you actually feel about that? B: Not too happy. [BNC: JK8 168-169] A: They wouldn’t do it, no. B: Why? [BNC: H5H 202-203] A: [...] then across from there to there. B: From side to side. [BNC: HDH 377-378] Despite their ubiquity, the semantic content of NSUs is often difficult to extract automatically. Non-sentential utterances are indeed intrinsically dependent on the dialogue context for their interpretation – for instance, the meaning of ”why” in the example above is impossible to decipher without knowing what precedes it. This paper describes a new approach to the classification of NSUs. The approach builds upon the work of Fernández et al. (2007), which present a corpus of NSUs along with a taxonomy and a classifier based on simple features. In particular, we show that the inclusion of new linguistic features and the use of active learning provide a modest but significant improvement in the classification accuracy compared to their approach. The next section presents the corpus used in this work and its associated taxonomy of NSUs. Section 3 describes our classification approach (extracted features and learning algorithm). Section 4 finally presents the empirical results and their comparison with the baseline.","This paper presented the results of an experiment in the classification of non-sentential utterances, extending the work of Fernández et al.

In our view, the development of such a corpus, including new dialogue domains and a broader range of conversational phenomena, could contribute to a better understanding of NSUs and their interpretation. Furthermore, the classification of NSUs according to their type only constitutes the first step in their semantic interpretation.

A fundamental role is played by Contextual information that is available when interpreting a message. In this paper, a Graph-based method is applied: a graph is built containing the contextual information needed to model complex interactions between messages. A Label Propagation algorithm is adopted to spread polarity information from known polarized nodes to the others.","Sentiment Analysis (SA) AUTHOR faces the problem of deciding whether a text expresses a sentiment, e.g. positivity or negativity. Social Media are observed to measure the sentiment expressed in the Web about products, companies or politicians. The interest in the analysis of tweets led to the definition of highly participated challenges, e.g. AUTHOR or AUTHOR. Machine Learning (ML) approaches are often adopted to classify the sentiment AUTHOR, where specific representations and hand-coded resources AUTHOR are used to train some classifier. As tweets are very short, the amount of available information for ML approaches is in general not sufficient for a robust decision. A valid strategy AUTHOR exploits Contextual information, e.g. the reply-to chain, to support a robust sentiment recognition in online discussions. In this paper, we foster the idea that Twitter messages belong to a network where complex interactions between messages are available. As suggested in AUTHOR, tweets can be represented in graph structures, along with words, hashtags or users. A Label Propagation algorithm AUTHOR can be adopted to propagate (possibly noisy) sentiment labels within the graph. In AUTHOR, it has been shown that such approach can support SA by determining how messages, words, hashtags and users influence each other. The definition of the graph is fundamental for the resulting inference, e.g. when mixing messages about different topics, sentiment detection can be difficult. We take inspiration from the contexts defined in AUTHOR. In AUTHOR no explicit relation between messages is considered. We, instead, build a graph where messages in the same context are linked each other and to the words appearing in them. Moreover, we inject prior polarity of words as available in a polarity lexicon AUTHOR. Experiments are carried out over a subset of the Evalita 2014 Sentipolc AUTHOR dataset, showing improvements in the polarity classification with respect to not using networked information. In the remaining, Section sec:approach presents our graph-based approach. In Section sec:exps we evaluate the proposed method with respect to a dataset in Italian and we derive the conclusions in Section sec:conclusion.","In this paper, the Contextual Graph is defined as a structure where messages can influence each other by considering both intra-context and extracontext links: the former are links between messages, while the latter serves to link messages in different contexts through shared words. The application of a Label Propagation algorithm confirms the positive impact of contextual information in the Sentiment Analysis task over Social Media. We successfully injected prior polarity information of words in the graph, obtaining further improvements. This is our first investigation in graph approaches for SA: we only adopted the MAD algorithm, while other algorithms have been defined, since (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) and they will be investigated in future works. Moreover, other contextual information could be adopted. Finally, other datasets should be considered, proving the effectiveness of the proposed method that does not strictly depend on the language of messages.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

At the time of writing, the corpus amounts to more than 20 million words, covers a period of time of twenty-one years spanning from 1993 to 2014 and it is planned to be extended to the end of the second term of President Barack Obama. The aim of the present article is to describe the composition of the corpus and the techniques used to extract, process and annotate it. Moreover, attention is paid to the use of the Temporal Random Indexing (TRI) on the corpus as a tool for linguistic analysis.","As political speech has been gaining more and more attention over recent years in the analysis of communication strategies, political corpora have become of paramount importance for the fulfilment of this objective. The CompWHoB Corpus, a spoken American English corpus currently being developed at the University of Naples Federico II, wants to meet the need for political language data, as it focuses on the political and media communication genre. This resource is a large collection of the transcripts of the White House Press Briefings, namely, the daily meetings held by the White House Press Secretary and the news media. As one of the main official channels of communication for the White House, briefings play indeed a crucial role in the administration communication strategies AUTHOR. The corpus currently amounts to more than 20 million words and spans from 1993 to 2014, thus covering a period of time of twenty-one years and five presidencies. Work is underway to extend the corpus so as to reach the end of the second term of President Barack Obama. Unlike other political corpora such as CORPS AUTHOR and the Political Speech Corpus of Bulgarian AUTHOR, the CompWHoB does not include monological situations, due to the inherent dialogical characteristics of the briefings. As other web corpora AUTHOR, the CompWHoB can be considered a web corpus AUTHOR, since its texts are directly extracted from The American Presidency Project website. Moreover, it should be pointed out that WHoB is a pre-existing specialized corpus AUTHOR annotated by using XML mark-up and mainly employed in the field of corpus linguistics. Thus, the aim of the present article is to describe how the corpus can be used as a future resource in different research fields such as computational linguistics, (political) linguistics, political science, etc. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the corpus. Section 3 describes the details of the corpus construction and annotation. The use of TRI on the corpus is then discussed in Section 4. Lastly, Section 5 concludes the paper.","At the time of writing, the CompWHoB Corpus is probably one of the largest political corpora mainly based on spontaneous spoken language. This feature represents one of its strongest points, as the linguistic analysis performed by employing the TRI has proved. As for the near future, two are our main goals: the first one is to make the process of structural annotation as much computational as possible by retrieving information from available political databases; the second one is to provide the corpus with syntactic parsing and improve the overall performance of the linguistic annotation process. In terms of accessibility, we intend to make the CompWHoB Corpus available via the CPQ web interface (Hardie, 2012) by the end of next year. For now, the fully annotated corpus is accessible and available on request.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We explore the possibility of basing a machine translation task in the medical domain on morphology. Starting from neoclassical formative elements, or confixes, we started building MedIta, a cross-language ontology of medical morphemes, aiming to offer a standardized medical consistent resource that includes distributional and semantic information of medical morphemes. Using this information, we have built an ontology-driven Italian-English machine translation prototype, based on a set of Finite State Transducers, and we have carried out an experiment on Orphanet medical corpus to evaluate the feasibility of this approach.","Automating Machine Translation (MT) of a technical language is a challenging task that requires an in-depth analysis both from a linguistic point of view and as regards the implementation of a complex system. This becomes even more complex in medical language. Indeed the translation of medical terminology must always be validated by a domain expert following official classification standards. For this reason currently there are no translation support tools specifically created for the medical domain. In this work we propose an MT system based on a set of Finite State Transducers that uses cross-language morpheme information provided by a lexical resource. The underlying idea is that in a technical language a morpho-semantic approach AUTHOR may be more effective than a probabilistic one in term-by-term translation tasks. Even though our approach could seem a bit ``old fashioned'', we must consider that proper nature of medical language, fully based by morphemes derived from neoclassical formative elements AUTHOR. Neoclassical formative elements are morphological elements that come into being from Latin and Greek words, they combine with each other following compositional morphology rules. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these elements, they have received different definitions, we prefer to use the term confixes, a morpheme with full semantic value, which has been predominantly used in the literature AUTHOR. In this work we focused only on word formation related to the medical domain.","In this work we presented a morphology-based machine translation prototype specifically suited for medical terminology. The prototype uses ontologies of morphemes and Finite State Transducers. Even though the approach may seem a little out-of-date, the preliminary results showed that it can work as well as a probabilistic system in such a specific domain. It is worth mentioning that at this early stage we tested the prototype only on samples, since the evaluation is an extremely time-consuming task: every translated term must be manually compared with one or more medical standards. Medical standards are often not aligned, therefore an Orpha-number (disease id) does not necessarily match a disease listed in ICD-10. Moreover, these resources are not easily usable in an automated way, therefore the evaluation should entirely be done manually.",20,In-domain IR and IE

This paper proposes an adaptation of a general purpose Named Entity Linking algorithm, which exploits the similarity measure computed over a Distributional Semantic Model, in the context of Italian tweets. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, we introduce a new dataset of tweets for entity linking that we developed specifically for the Italian language.","In this paper we address the problem of entity linking for Italian tweets. Named Entity Linking (NEL) is the task of annotating entity mentions in a portion of text with links to a knowledge base. This task usually requires as first step the recognition of portions of text that refer to named entities (entity recognition). The linking phase follows, which usually subsumes the entity disambiguation, i.e. selecting the proper concept from a restricted set of candidates (e.g. New York city or New York state). NEL together with Word Sense Disambiguation, i.e. the task of associating each word occurrence with its proper meaning given a sense inventory, is critical to enable automatic systems to make sense of unstructured text. Initially developed for reasonably long and clean text, such as news articles, NEL techniques usually show unsatisfying performance on noisy, short and poorly written text constituted by microblogs such as Twitter. These difficulties notwithstanding, with an average of 500 billion posts being generated every day1 , tweets represent a rich source of information. Twitterbased tasks like user interest discovery, tweet recommendation, social/economical analysis, and so forth, could benefit from such a kind of semantic features represented by named entities linked to a knowledge base. Such tasks become even more problematic when the tweet analysis involves languages different from English. Specifically, in the context of Italian language, the lack of languagespecific resources and annotated tweet datasets complicates the assessment of NEL algorithms for tweets. Our main contributions to this problem are: • An adaptation of a Twitter-based NEL algorithm based on a Distributional Semantic Model (DSM-TEL), which needs no specific Italian resources since it is completely unsupervised (Section 3). • An Italian dataset of manually annotated tweets for NEL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Italian dataset of such a type. Section 2 reports details concerning the annotation phase and statistics about the dataset. • An evaluation of well known NEL algorithms available for Italian language on this dataset, comparing their performance with our DSMTEL algorithm in terms of both entity recognition and linking. Section 4 shows and analyses the results of that evaluation.","We tackled the problem of entity linking for Italian tweets. Our contribution is threefold: 1) we build a first Italian tweet dataset for entity linking, 2) we adapted a distributional-based NEL algorithm to the Italian language, and 3) we compared stateof-the-art systems on the built dataset. As for English, the entity linking task for Italian tweets turn out to be quite difficult, as pointed out by the very low performance of all systems employed. As future work we plan to extend the dataset in order to provide more examples for training and testing data.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

This paper presents the challenging aim of the SemBurst research project which applies distributional methods not only to words, but to sets of semantic information taken from existing semantic resources and associated with words in syntactic contexts. The idea is to inject semantics into vector space models to find correlations between statements (rather than between words). The proposal may have strong impact on key applications such as Word Sense Disambiguation, Textual Entailment, and others.","One of the main current research frontiers in Computational Linguistics is represented by studies and techniques usually associated with the label “Distributional Semantics” (DS), which are focused on the exploitation of distributional analyses of words in syntactic compositions. Their importance is demonstrated by recent ERC projects (COMPOSES and DisCoTex) and by a growing research interest in the scientific community. The proposal presented in this paper is about going far beyond this state of the art. DS uses traditional Data Mining (DM) techniques on text, considering language as a grammar-based type of data, instead of simple unstructured sequences of tokens. It quantifies semantic (in truth lexical) similarities between linguistically-refined tokens (words, lemmas, parts-of-speech, etc.), based on their distributional properties in large corpora. DM relies on Vector Space Models (VSMs), a representation of textual information as vectors of numeric values AUTHOR. DM techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) have been successfully applied to text for information indexing and extraction tasks, using matrix decompositions such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reconstruct the latent structure behind the distributional hypothesis AUTHOR. It usually works by evaluating the relatedness of different terms, forming word clusters sharing similar contexts. Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) AUTHOR and Salient Semantic Analysis (SSA) AUTHOR revisits these methods in the way they define the conceptual layer. With LSA a word's hidden concept is based on its surrounding words, with ESA it is based on Wikipedia entries, and with SSA it is based on hyperlinked words in Wikipedia entries. These approaches represent only a partial step towards the use of semantic information as input for Distributional Analysis. While distributional representations excel at modelling lexical semantic phenomena such as word similarity and categorization (conceptual aspect), Formal Semantics in Computational Linguistics focuses on the representation of the meaning in a set theoretic way (functional aspect), providing a systematic treatment of compositionality and reasoning. Recent interest in the combination of Formal Semantics and Distributional Semantics have been proposed AUTHOR AUTHOR AUTHOR, that employ approaches based on the lexical level. However, 1) the problem of compositionality of lexical distributional vectors is still open and the proposed solutions are limited to combination of vectors, 2) reasoning on classic distributional representations is not possible, since they are VSMs at the lexical level only, 3) the connection of DS with traditional Formal Semantics is not straightforward AUTHOR AUTHOR since DS is limited to a semantics of similarity which is able to support retrieval but not other aspects such as reasoning; and 4) DS does not scale up to phrases and sentences due to data sparseness and growth in model size AUTHOR, restraining the use of tensors.

Moving from single pairs to a graph has the advantage of providing an overall view of the issue discussed in the text, but this may lead to possible inconsistencies due to the combination of the TE pairs into a unique graph. In this paper, we adopt argumentation theory to support human annotators in detecting the possible sources of inconsistencies.","A Textual Entailment (TE) system (Dagan et al., 2009) automatically assigns to independent pairs of two textual fragments either an entailment or a contradiction relation. However, in some real world scenarios like analyzing costumer reviews about a service or product, these pairs cannot be considered as independent. For instance, all the reviews about a certain service need to be collected into a single graph, to understand the overall problems/merits of the service. The combination of TE pairs into a unique graph may generate inconsistencies due to the wrong relation assignment by the TE system, which could not have been identified if TE pairs were considered independently. The detection of such inconsistencies is usually left to human annotators, which later correct them. The need of processing such graphs to support annotators is therefore of crucial importance, particularly when dealing with big amounts of data. Our research question is How to support annotators in detecting inconsistencies in TE graphs? The term entailment graph has been introduced by (Berant et al., 2010) as a structure to model entailment relations between propositional templates. Differently, in this paper we consider bipolar entailment graphs (BEGs), where two kinds of edges are considered, i.e., entailment and contradiction, to reason over the graph consistency. We answer the research question by adopting abstract argumentation theory (Dung, 1995), a reasoning framework used to detect and solve inconsistencies in the so-called argumentation graphs, where nodes are called arguments, and edges represent a conflict relation. Argumentation semantics allows to compute consistent sets of arguments, given the conflicts among them. We define the BEGincs (BEG-Inconsistencies) framework, which translates a BEG into an argumentation graph. It then provides to the annotators sets of arguments, following argumentation semantics, that are supposed to be consistent. If it is not the case, the TE system wrongly assigned some relations. Moving from single pairs to an overall graph allows for the detection of inconsistencies otherwise undiscovered. BEGincs does not identify the precise relation causing the inconsistency, but providing annotators with the consistent arguments sets, they are supported in narrowing the causes of inconsistency.","We have presented BEGincs, a new formal framework that, translating a BEG into an argumentation graph, returns inconsistent set of arguments, if a wrong relation assignment by the TE system occurred. These inconsistent arguments sets are then used by annotators to detect the presence of a wrong assignment, and if so, to narrow the set of possibly erroneous relations. If no mistakes are produced in relation assignment, by definition BEGincs semantics return consistent arguments sets. Assuming that in several real world scenarios TE pairs are interconnected, we ask to the NLP community to contribute in the effort of building suitable resources. In BEGincs, we plan to verify and ensure transitivity of BEGs.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

After describing a simple architecture for generating template-based messages, we consider the relationship between message design and some persuasion theories.","MADIMAN (Multimedia Application for DIet Management) is a project that explores the possibility of applying artificial intelligence in the context of diet. The design idea is to create a virtual dietist that helps people to follow a healthy diet. Using the ubiquity of mobile devices you want to build an artificial intelligence system that allows (1) to recover, analyze, preserve the nutritional values of a specific recipe, (2) to control its compatibility with the diet that you are following and (3) to persuade the user to make the best choice compared to this diet. In the hypothetical application scenario, the interaction between man and food is mediated by an artificial system that, based on various factors, encourages or discourages the user to eat a specific dish. The factors that the system should consider are: the diet that you intend to follow, the food that has been eaten in the previous days, the nutritional values of the specific dish that you want to choose. The application architecture that the project wants to realize is a web services system (Fig. 1) that interacts with the user through an APP (Fig. 1-1.), analyze the contents of a specific recipe by means of an information retrieved form (Fig. 01-3.), reasons by means of an automatic reasoning module (Fig. 01-4.) and, on the basis of the reasoning, generate a persuasive message to convince the user to make the best choice using an automatic natural language generation module (NLG, Fig. This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The automatic treatment of the language comes into play in the analysis phase of the AUTHOR recipe, as well as in the generation of the persuasive message. In particular, the message generation system must use the reasoning output as input. At the present state of development of the project, the reasoner is a system based on the theory of Simple Temporary Problems, which produces a constant (I1, I2, C1, C2, C3. I: incompatible, C: compatible) together with a simple explanation of the result (IPO vs. IPER) AUTHOR. For example, at the end of the argument, a dish may be incompatible with a diet because it has too low protein values (I1+IPO) or too high (I1+IPER); or a dish may be compatible although hyper-protein (C2+IPER) but, if chosen, it will have to be balanced by choosing in the future hypo-protein dishes. The present work is structured as follows: in the sec section::nlg will describe the language generation module, in the sec section::persuasion will review some theories of persuasion that inspired the design of the generation module, while in the sec section::conclusion will conclude the work with some considerations on the state of the project and future developments.","In this work we have described the main characteristics of a system of generating messages with persuasive intents in the context of diet. Currently, in order to be able to quantitatively verify the goodness of the proposed approach, we plan to follow two separate experimental methods. Initially, we are running a simulation that takes into account the various factors that affect the success of our system. On the one hand, it is necessary to shape the user's propensity to be persuaded, on the other hand, it is necessary to consider sensible numerical values to shape the diet and the dishes. If the simulation gives promising results, then we intend to evaluate the system in a realistic medical trial. Following the evaluation model proposed by Reiter for the STOP system (Reiter et al., 2003), we intend to test the system through control groups in a specific medical context, namely that of clinics to treat essential obesity.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

We focus on the case of dependency parsing for Italian and we investigate whether such strategy is convenient and to what extent. Our experiments, conducted on very large sizes of silver data, show that quantity does not win over quality.","Collecting and manually annotating linguistic data (typically referred to as gold standard) is a very expensive activity, both in terms of time and effort AUTHOR. For this reason, in the last years the question of whether we can train good Natural Language Processing (NLP) models by using just automatically annotated data (called silver standard) is arising interest AUTHOR. In this case, human annotations are replaced by those generated by pre-existing state-of-the-art systems. The annotations are then merged by using a committee approach specifically tailored on the data AUTHOR. The key advantage of such approach is the possibility to drastically reduce both time and effort, therefore generating considerably larger data sets in a fraction of the time. This is particularly true for text data in different fields such as temporal information extraction AUTHOR, text chunking AUTHOR and named entity recognition AUTHOR to cite just a few, and for non-textual data like in in medical imaging recognition AUTHOR. In this paper we focus on the case of dependency parsing for the Italian language. Dependency parsers are systems that automatically generate the linguistic dependency structure of a given sentence AUTHOR. An example is given in Figure~fig:dp_example_italian for the sentence ``Essenziale per l'innesco delle reazioni è la presenza di radiazione solare.'' (The presence of solar radiation is essential for triggering the reactions). We investigate whether the use of very large silver standard corpora leads to train good dependency parsers, in order to address the following question: Which characteristic is more important for a training set: quantity or quality? The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents some background works on dependency parsers for Italian; Section 3 presents the silver standard corpus used for the experiments and its linguistic features, with Section 4 describing the experimental settings and Section 5 describing the results of the comparison between the trained parsers (considering different sizes of data) and two test sets: gold and silver. Finally, the paper's contributions are summed up in Section 6.","We presented a set of experiments to investigate the contribution of silver standards when used as substitution of gold standard data. Similar investigations are arising interesting in any NLP subcommunities due to the high cost of generating gold data. The results presented in this paper highlight two important facts: Figure 2: Parsers’ performance against silver and gold test sets. In both cases, the models exhibit an asymptotic behaviour. Figures are presented in Table 2. Silver data sizes express the number of sentences. ‘K’ stands for 1.000. i) The size increase of the training corpus does not provide any sensible difference in terms of performance. In both test sets, a number of sentences between 5.000 and 10.000 seem to be enough to obtain a reliable training. We note that the size of the EVALITA training set lies in such boundary. ii) The annotations between gold and silver corpora may be different. This is suggested by the fact that none of the parsers achieved a satisfactory performance when trained and tested on different sources. We also note that the gold and silver test data sets have different characteristics (average sentence length, lexicon and type of annotation), which may partially justify the gap. On the other hand, the fact that a parser re-trained on annotations produced by a state-of-the-art system (DeSR) in the EVALITA task performs poorly on the very same gold set sheds light on the possibility that such official benchmark test set may not be representative enough. The main limitation of this study lays in the fact that the experiments have not been repeated multiple times, therefore we have no information about the variance of the figures (UAS column in Table 2). On the other hand, the large size of the data sets involved and the absence of any outlier figure suggest that the overall trends should not change. With the computational facilities available to us for this research, a full analysis of that sort would have required years to be completed. The results presented in the paper shed light on a recent research question about the employability of automatically annotated data. In the context of dependency parsing for Italian, we provided evidences to support the fact that the quality of the annotation is a far better characteristic to take into account when compared to quantity. A similar study on languages other than Italian would constitute an interesting future work of the research hereby presented.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

The specificities of the corpus and its diachronistic nature make it particularly useful both for linguistic-computational applications and for socio-pedagogical studies.","The construction of a body of learning productions has always been at the heart of the research activities of the computational linguistic community. Particular attention is paid to the annotation and classification of the mistakes made by learners. Corporate noted with this type of information are typically used for the study and creation of models for the development of writing skills (Deane and Quinlan, 2010) and for the development of systems to support teaching (the so-called Intelligent Computers) (Granger, 2003). In this scenario, a particular interest is dedicated to the collection and annotation of the body of productions of L2 learners employed as a starting point for studies on the development of the interlanguage, for reflection activities on the possible modification and/or customization of the teaching action of the teacher and for the development of systems of automatic correction of errors. Most of the activities concerned the construction of a L2 learning corps, among which the most recent and the largest is the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE) (Dahlmeier et al., 2013), used as a reference resource in 2013 and 2014 of the ""Shared Task on Grammatical Error Correction"" (Ng et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2014). However, in recent years, the attention has also been directed to L2 other than English, such as the Arabic (Zaghouani et al., 2015), the German (Ludeling et al., 2005), the Hungarian (Dickinson and Ledbetter, 2012), the Basque (Aldabe et al., 2005) and the Czech and Italian (Andorno and Rastelli, 2009; Boyd et al., 2014). Less attention has been paid to the construction of resources consisting of L1 learning productions. An exception is represented by the KoKo corpus (Abel et al., 2014), collection of productions of German learners L1 of the last year of the second grade secondary school enriched with background information of the learners (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic situation), manual recording of spelling and grammatical errors, and linguistic information recorded automatically. By placing ourselves in this last scenario, in this article we present CITA (Corpus Italiano di Apprenti L1) the first corpus of written productions of Litaliano L1 learners recorded manually with different types of errors and with its correction. The corpus, composed of productions of the first two years of the first grade secondary school, is to our knowledge not only the first Italian corpus of this type but contains characteristics of novelties that make it unique even within the international panorama of research.","CitA can also be used in socio-pedagogic studies, allowing the distribution of errors to be related to the background variables. It is thus possible to verify the extent to which changes in writing are attributable to background socio-economic conditions. For example, it is interesting to note how the statistical surveys conducted have revealed that the decrease in the incorrect use of vocabulary from the first to the second year is significantly related to the habit of reading. Or you can study how grammatical errors vary statistically significantly compared to the placement of the school in the center or outskirts of Rome: while in the center schools the errors decrease in the transition from the first to the second year, in two of the four schools on the outskirts increase. Different is the case of spelling errors that do not vary statistically significantly from the background variables considered. This would confirm some studies (Colombo, 2011; Ferreri, 1971; Lavino, 1975; De Mauro, 1977) where it is stated that spelling correctness is a skill that is acquired over time because it requires the sedimentation of norms, often arbitrary, that establish not causal bonds between sound and graphics.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

There is the need to develop large data sets, mainly parallel corpora, annotated with MWEs, since they are useful both for SMT training purposes and MWE translation quality evaluation. This paper describes a methodology to annotate a parallel spoken corpus with MWEs. The dataset used for this experiment is an English-Italian corpus extracted from the TED spoken corpus and complemented by an SMT output.","Multiword expressions (MWEs) represent one of the major challenges for all Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and in particular for Machine Translation (MT) (Sag et al., 2002). The notion of MWE includes a wide and frequent set of different lexical phenomena with their specific properties, such as idioms, compound words, domain specific terms, collocations, Named Entities or acronyms. Their morpho-syntactic, semantic and pragmatic idiomaticity (Baldwin and Kim, 2010) together with translational asymmetries (Monti and Todirascu, 2015), i.e. the differences between an MWE in the source language and its translation, prevent technologies from using systematic criteria for properly handling MWEs. For this reason their automatic identification, extraction and translation are very difficult tasks. Recent PARSEME surveys1 have highlighted that there is lack of MWE-annotated resources, and in particular parallel corpora. Moreover, the few available ones are usually limited to the study of specific MWE types and specific language pairs. The focus of our research work is therefore to provide a methodology for annotating a parallel corpus with all MWEs (with no restrictions to a specific type) which can be used both for training and testing SMT systems. We have refined this methodology while developing the English-Italian MWE-TED corpus, which contains 1.5K sentences and 31K EN tokens.It is a subset of the TED spoken corpus annotated with all the MWEs detected during the annotation process.

The proposed task aims at providing a complete evaluation framework for factuality profiling, at taking the first steps in the direction of narrative container evaluation for Italian, and at making available benchmark data for high-level semantic tasks.","Reasoning about events plays a fundamental role in text understanding; it involves different aspects, such as event identification and classification, temporal anchoring of events, temporal ordering, and event factuality profiling. In view of the next EVALITA edition (Attardi et al., 2015),1 we propose FacTA (Factuality and Temporal Anchoring), the first task comprising the evaluation of both factuality profiling and temporal anchoring, two strictly interrelated aspects of event interpretation. Event factuality is defined in the literature as the level of committed belief expressed by relevant sources towards the factual status of events mentioned in texts (Saurı́ and Pustejovsky, 2012). The notion of factuality is closely connected to other notions thoroughly explored by previous research conducted in the NLP field, such as subjectivity, belief, hedging and modality; see, among others, (Wiebe et al., 2004; Prabhakaran et al., 2010; Medlock and Briscoe, 2007; Saurı et al., 2006). More specifically, the factuality status of events is related to their degree of certainty (from absolutely certain to uncertain) and to their polarity (affirmed vs. negated). These two aspects are taken into consideration in the factuality annotation frameworks proposed by Saurı́ and Pustejovsky (2012) and van Son et al. (2014), which inspired the definition of factuality profiling in FacTA. Temporal anchoring consists of associating all temporally grounded events to time anchors, i.e. temporal expressions, through a set of temporal links. The TimeML annotation framework (Pustejovsky et al., 2005) addresses this issue through the specifications for temporal relation (TLINK) annotation, which also implies the ordering of events and temporal expressions with respect to one another. Far from being a trivial task (see systems performance in English (UzZaman et al., 2013) and in Italian (Mirza and Minard, 2014)), TLINK annotation requires the comprehension of complex temporal structures; moreover, the number of possible TLINKs grows together with the number of annotated events and temporal expressions. Pustejovsky and Stubbs (2011) introduced the notion of narrative container with the aim of reducing the number of TLINKs to be identified in a text while improving informativeness and accuracy. A narrative container is a temporal expression or an event explicitly mentioned in the text into which other events temporally fall (Styler IV et al., 2014). The use of narrative containers proved to be useful to accurately place events on timelines in the domain of clinical narratives (Miller et al., 2013). Temporal anchoring in FacTA moves in the direction of this notion of narrative container by fo187cusing on specific types of temporal relations that link an event to the temporal expression to which it is anchored. However, anchoring events in time is strictly dependent of their factuality profiling. For instance, counterfactual events will never have a temporal anchor or be part of a temporal relation (i.e. they never occurred); this may not hold for speculated events, whose association with a temporal anchor or participation in a temporal relation is important to monitor future event outcomes.","The FacTA task connects two related aspects of events: factuality and temporal anchoring. The availability of this information for Italian will both promote research in these areas and fill a gap with respect to other languages, such as English, for a variety of semantic tasks. Factuality profiling is a challenging task aimed at identifying the speaker/writers degree of commitment to the events being referred to in a text. Having access to this type of information plays a crucial role for distinguishing relevant and nonrelevant information for more complex tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, and temporal processing. On the other hand, anchoring events in time requires to interpret temporal information which is not often explicitly provided in texts. The identification of the correct temporal anchor facilitates the organization of events in groups of narrative containers which could be further used to improve the identification and classification of in-document and cross-document temporal relations. The new annotation layers will be added on top of an existing dataset, the EVENTI corpus, thus allowing to re-use existing resources and to promote the development of multi-layered annotated corpora; moreover a new linguistic resource, WItaC, will be provided. The availability of these data is to be considered strategic as it will help the study the interactions of different language phenomena and enhance the development of more robust systems for automatic access to the content of texts. The use of well structured annotation guidelines grounded both on official and de facto standards is a stimulus for the development of multilingual approaches and promote discussions and reflections in the NLP community at large. Considering the success of evaluation campaigns such as Clinical TempEval at SemEval 2015 and given the presence of an active community focused on extra-propositional aspects of meanings (e.g. attribution11 ), making available new annotated data in the framework of an evaluation campaign for a language other than English can have a large impact in the NLP community.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The background idea is that the evolution of computing in the 1960s and 1970s might have triggered a transformation of the notion of influence and that today's interactions between the field of natural language processing and digital humanities are still sustaining it. In order to do so, we studied a specific interdisciplinary project dedicated to the topic and we reproduced those experiments. Then we compared the results with different text mining techniques in order to understand how contemporary methods can deal with the rethinking of the notion of influence.","In recent years, when the institutional presence of digital humanities grew stronger, the need for a closer look at the history of humanities computing (the name under which this community of researchers was originally gathered) became more urgent, and some answers have been attempted AUTHOR. Rehearsing the history of humanities computing proved to be a challenging task, because of the hybrid and interdisciplinary nature of it and because of its entanglement up with a field like computing, which is epistemologically unstable and interdisciplinary as well AUTHOR.\newline This paper is a contribution to this attempt to develop an history of humanities computing, trying to combine together the histories of computing, of computational linguistics, and of literary studies. We present here the first steps of a research that aims at investigating the possibility that the emergence of a ``discontinuity'' in the notion of literary influence (and, consequently, of literary source), or at least the critical awareness of it, might be related to some early experiments of humanities computing. The background idea is that the evolution of computing in the 1960s and 1970s might have contributed to this transformation of the notion of influence, and that today's interactions between the field of natural language processing and digital humanities might have further developed it, possibly in new directions.\newline In order to do so, the paper is organised as follows. First of all, we define the problem of influence from the point of view of literary studies and literary theory. With that background in mind, we study a specific interdisciplinary project dedicated to the topic AUTHOR and we analysed Raben key-role on AUTHOR computational analysis. Moreover, to get a complete understanding of the methods applied in this work, we recreated the same approach with a script in Python.\newline Then, we decided to update Goodman and Villani's approach by adopting contemporary text mining methods. While conducting this specific task our purpose was not only to compare the different techniques and to highlight possible mistakes in Goodman and Villani's approach, but we aimed especially at understanding whether contemporary methods commonly adopted in natural language processing and digital humanities are able to answer questions and solve problematic issues emerged during the rethinking of the notion of influence in recent years.","To conclude, for what concerns more specifically the possible boundary between humanities computing and the study of influence in literary studies, we believe that computational techniques helped to develop a keen sense of the issues involved, foregrounding the role of mechanical reading in de-idealising the problem. The use of machines in turn triggered Bloom’s creation of his own “machine for criticism” (Bloom, 1976) built in order to understand how the anxiety of influence was dealt with by writers. If it’s true that Bloom’s theory “anxiously responds to [...] the subliminally perceived threat of textual anonymity promoted by the ’mechanical reproduction’ of available texts” (Renza, 1990), that is to say something that with the digital will soon reach an entirely new, we can consider Raben’s work as moved by a similar tension. Compared to Bloom, however, the advantage of the latter was that he was working from within, so to speak, the machine language. For this reason, he was able to begin transforming the traditional approach, that emphasised continuity within literary traditions, with a different one more focused on the way in which creative writing works, and on what the role of linguistic memory and of “creative” reading (or, as Prose (2006) said, reading as a writer).",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics
98_2015,2015,CLIC43,"Marilena Di Bari, Serge Sharoff, Martin Thomas",A manually-annotated Italian corpus for fine-grained sentiment analysis,ENG,3,1,1,University of Leeds,1,1,1,3,"Marilena Di Bari, Serge Sharoff, Martin Thomas",0,0,United Kingdom,Leeds,"This paper presents the results of the annotation carried out on the Italian section of the SentiML corpus, consisting of both originally-produced and translated texts of different types. The two main advantages are that: (i) the work relies on the linguistically-motivated assumption that, by encapsulating opinions in pairs (called appraisal groups), it is possible to annotate (and automatically extract) their sentiment in context; (ii) it is possible to compare Italian to its English and Russian counterparts, as well as to extend the annotation to other languages.","Overall, the field of Sentiment Analysis (SA) aims at automatically classifying opinions as positive, negative or neutral AUTHOR. While at first the focus of SA was on the document level (coarse-grained) classification, with the years it has become more and more at the sentence level or below the sentence (fine-grained). This shift has been due to both linguistic and application reasons. Linguistic reasons arise because sentiment is often expressed over specific entities rather than an overall document. As for practical reasons, SA tasks are often aimed at discriminating between more specific aspects of these entities. For example, if an opinion is supposed to be on the plot of a movie, it is not unusual that the user also evaluates actors' performance or director's choices AUTHOR. For SA applications these opinions need to be assessed separately. Also opinions are not expressed as simple and direct assertions, but by using a number of stylistic devices such as pronominal references, abbreviations, idioms and metaphors. Finally, the automatic identification of sarcasm, irony and humour is even more challenging AUTHOR. For all these reasons, fine-grained sentiment analysis is looking at entities that are usually chains of words such as ``noun+verb+adjective'' (e.g. the house is beautiful) or ``adverb+adjective+noun'' (e.g. very nice car) AUTHOR. In addition to the multitude of approaches to fine-grained SA, there is also shortage of multilingual comparable studies and available resources. To close this gap, we designed the SentiML annotation scheme AUTHOR and applied it to texts in three languages, English, Italian and Russian. The proposed annotation scheme extends previous works AUTHOR and allows multi-level annotations of three categories: target (T) (expression the sentiment refers to), modifier (M) (expression conveying the sentiment) and appraisal group (AG) (couple of modifier and target). For example in: “Gli uomini hanno il potere di sradicare la [povertà]T ]AG, ma anche di [[sradicare]M le 105[tradizioni]T ]AG ”. (Men have the power to eradicate poverty, but also to eradicate traditions) \noindent the groups ``sradicare povertà'' (eradicate poverty) and ``sradicare tradizioni'' (eradicate traditions) have an opposite sentiment despite including the same word sradicare (to eradicate). This scheme has been developed in order to facilitate the annotation of the sentiment and other advanced linguistic features that contribute to it, but also the appraisal type according to the Appraisal Framework (AF) AUTHOR in a multilingual perspective (Italian, English and Russian). The AF is the development of the Systemic Functional Linguistics AUTHOR specifically concerned with the study of the language of evaluation, attitude and emotion. It consists of attitude, engagement and graduation. Of these, attitude is sub-divided into affect, which deals with personal emotions and opinions (e.g. excited, lucky); judgement, which concerns author's attitude towards people's behaviour (e.g. nasty, blame); appreciation, which considers the evaluation of things (e.g. unsuitable, comfortable). The engagement system considers the positioning of oneself with respect to the opinions of others, while graduation investigates how the use of language amplifies or diminishes attitude and engagement. In particular, force is related to intensity, quantity and temporality. To the best of our knowledge the AF has only been applied in the case of Italian for purposes not related to computation AUTHOR. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the annotation scheme and the annotated Italian corpus, Section 3 reports the results and finally Section 4 our conclusions.","In this paper we have described a manuallyannotated corpus of Italian for fine-grained sentiment analysis. The manual annotation has been done in order to include important linguistic features. Apart from extracting statistics related to the annotations, we have also compared the manual annotations to a sentiment dictionary and demonstrated that (i) the dictionary includes only 29.29% of the annotated words, and (ii) the prior orientation given in the dictionary is different from the correct one given by the context in 28.18% of the cases. The original and annotated texts in Italian (along with English and Russian) and the Document Type Definition (DTD) of SentiML to be used with MAE are publicly available. In the meanwhile, the authors are already working on an automatic system to identify and classify appraisal groups multilingually.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The annotation suggests the feasibility of a large-scale enrichment.","Several studies have been carried out on the definition of opposition in linguistics, philosophy, cognitive science and psychology. Our notion of opposition is based on lexical semantic studies by Lyons (1977), Cruse (1986; 2002; 2011), and Pustejovsky (2000), as synthesized in Jezek (2015). The category of opposites can be said to include pairs of terms that contrast each other with respect to one key aspect of their meaning, such that together they exhaust this aspect completely. Examples include the following pairs: to open / to close, to rise / to fall. Paradoxically, the first step in the process of identifying a relationship of opposition often consists in identifying something that the meanings of the words under examination have in common. A second step is to identify a key aspect in which the two meanings oppose each other1 . Opposites cannot be true simultaneously of the same entity, for example a price cannot be said to rise and to fall at exactly the same point in time. It is an open discussion whether opposition is a semantic or a lexical relation (Murphy, 2010; Fellbaum, 1998); what is clear is that the predicate that is considered opposite of another predicate does not activate this relation for all its senses. For example, the Italian verb abbattere is considered opposite to costruire as far as the former is considered in its sense of to destroy (a building), and the latter in its sense of to build (a building). The opposition relation does not hold if abbattere is considered in its sense of to kill (an animal). Oppositions between verbs senses are poorly encoded in lexical resources. English WordNet 3.1 (Miller et al., 1990) tags oppositions among verb senses using the label antonymy; for example, increase#1 is in antonymy relation with decrease#1, diminish#1, lessen#1, fall#11. In VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), opposition (antonymy) is considered a symmetric relation between verbs, which includes several subtypes; the relation is extracted at verb level (not at sense level). FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010), on the other hand, has no tag for the opposition relation, although a subset of cases can be traced via the perspective on relation. As regards Italian, in MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002) the opposition relation (labeled: antonymy relation) is considered a lexical relation and is represented in the currently available version for English, but not for Italian. In SIMPLE (Lenci et al., 2000), the opposition relation (antonymy) is considered a relation between word senses and it has been defined for adjectives (e.g., dead/alive and hot/cold), although the authors specify it can possibly be extended also to other parts of speech. In Senso Comune (Oltramari et al., 2013) the annotation of the opposition relation appears not to be implemented, even if the tag for the relation (antonimia) is present. The experiment described in the paper focuses on the annotation of opposition relations among verb senses. We annotate these relations in the lexical resource T-PAS (Jezek et al., 2014), an inventory of typed predicate argument structures for Italian manually acquired from corpora through inspection and annotation of actual uses of the analyzed verbs. The corpus instances associated to each T-PAS represent a rich set of grounded information not available in other resources and facilitate the interpretation of the different senses of the verbs 2 . We collected data using crowdsourcing, a methodology already used in other NLP tasks, such as Frame Semantic Role annotation (Fossati et al., 2013; Feizabadi and Padó, 2014), Lexical Substitution (Kremer et al., 2014), Contradictory Event Pairs Acquisition (Takabatake et al., 2015).",In this paper we have presented a crowdsourcing experiment for the annotation of the opposition relation among verb senses in the Italian T-PAS resource. The annotation experiment has shown the feasibility of collecting opposition relation among Italian verb senses through crowdsourcing. We propose a methodology based on the automatic substitution of a verb with a candidate opposite and show that the IAA obtained using sense examples is comparable with the IAA obtained by other annotations based on sense definitions. Ongoing work includes further annotation of the opposition relations in T-PAS using crowd answers and a deep examination of the causes which lead to the generation of sentences with no sense.,7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The tool uses both statistical measures and linguistic information to detect a weighted list of n-grams representing the most important concepts of a text. KD is the reimplementation of an existing tool, which has been extended with new features, a high level of customizability, a shorter processing time and an extensive evaluation on different text genres in English and Italian (i.e. scientific articles and historical texts).","This paper presents Keyphrase Digger (henceforth KD), a new implementation of the KX system for keyphrase extraction. Both KX (Pianta and Tonelli, 2010; Tonelli et al., 2012) and KD combine statistical measures with linguistic information to identify and extract weighted keyphrases from English and Italian texts. KX took part to the SemEval 2010 task on “Automatic Keyphrase Extraction from Scientific Articles” (Kim et al., 2010) achieving the 7th best result out of 20 in the final ranking. KX is part of TextPro (Pianta et al., 2008), a suite of NLP tools developed by Fondazione Bruno Kessler 1 . The aim of KX re-implementation was to improve system performance in terms of F-measure, processing speed and customizability, so to make its integration possible in web-based applications. Besides, its adaptation to different types of texts has become possible also for not expert users, and its application to large document collections has been significantly improved. Keyphrases are n-grams of different length, both single and multi-token expressions, which capture the main concepts of a given document (Turney, 2000). Their extraction is very useful when integrated in complex NLP tasks such as text categorization (Hulth and Megyesi, 2006), opinion mining (Berend, 2011) and summarization (D’Avanzo and Magnini, 2005)2 . Moreover keyphrases, especially if displayed using an effective visualization, can help summarize and navigate document collections so to allow their socalled ‘distant reading’ (Moretti, 2013). This need to easily grasp the concise content of a text through keyphrases is particularly relevant given the increasing availability of digital document collections in many domains. Nevertheless, outside the computational linguistics community, for example among humanities scholars, the extraction of keywords is often assimilated with the extraction of the most frequent (single) words in a text, see for instance the success of tools such as Textal3 and Voyant4 in the Digital Humanities community. In some cases, stopwords are still included among the top-ranked keywords, leading to a key-concept list which is little informative and just reflects the Zipfian distribution of words in language. KD, instead, is designed to be easily customized by scholars from different communities, while sticking to the definition of keyphrases in use in the computational linguistics community. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe KD architecture and features while in Section 3 the system evaluation is reported. We present the application of KX to the historical domain and the web-based interface available online in Section 4. Future works and conclusions are drawn in Section 5.","This paper presents KD, a keyphrase extraction system that re-implements the basic algorithm of KX but adds new features, a high level of customizability and an improved processing speed. KD currently works on English and Italian and can take in input texts pre-processed with different available PoS taggers and lemmatizers for these two languages. Nevertheless, the system could be easily adapted to manage more languages and additional PoS taggers by modifying few configuration parameters. KD will be soon integrated in the next TextPro release12 and it will be also released as a standalone module. Meanwhile, we made it available online as part of an easy-to-use web application, so that it can be easily accessed also by users without a technical background. This work targets in particular humanities scholars, who often do not know how to access state-of-the-art tools for keyphrase extraction.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Currently, apart from purely statistical approaches, the most common methods for the extraction of WoCs involve searching a corpus via sets of patterns and then ranking the extracted candidates according to various association measures (AMs) in order to distinguish meaningful combinations from sequences of words that do not form any kind of relevant unit AUTHOR. Generally, the search is performed for either shallow morphosyntactic (POS) patterns (P-based approach) or syntactic dependency relations (S-based approach) AUTHOR. While P-based approaches have shown to yield satisfactory results for relatively fixed, short and adjacent WoCs, it has been suggested that syntactic dependencies might be more helpful to capture discontinuous and syntactically flexible WoCs AUTHOR. The two methods intuitively seem to be highly complementary rather than competing with one another, and attempts are currently being proposed to put them together AUTHOR. In previous work AUTHOR, we compared the performance of the two methods against two benchmarks (a dictionary and expert judgments), showing that the two methods are indeed complementary and that automatic extraction from corpora adds a high number of WoCs that are not recorded in manually compiled dictionaries. As an extension of that work, in this paper we shift the focus of investigation by addressing the following research questions: What is the effect of different benchmarks when evaluating an extraction method? What do our results tell us about the bechmarks themselves? And, as a byproduct, can experts / laypeople be exploited to populate a lexicographic combinatory resource for Italian?","As for extraction methods per se, we observed that recall against a manually compiled WoC dictionary is good for both EXTra and LexIt, and, especially, that the two systems are complementary. In the human evaluation performed by experts, 40% of WoCs automatically extracted with EXTra and LexIt are deemed valid, and more than half of these are not attested in DiCi. We can thus say that data from corpora proves to be very fruitful, especially if we use the two methods complementarily. As for benchmarks, we observed that the dictionary we have evaluated is not an exhaustive resource, and should be complemented with corpusextracted WoCs. We also observed that expert- and laypeople-based evaluations differ, which raises a number of interesting, albeit puzzling questions. Overall, it seems that the notion of WoC, as well as of idiomaticity, is quite a complex one to grasp for non-linguists: the collection of judgments took quite a long time to be completed (much more than we expected) and evaluators explicitly regarded the task and the instructions as particularly complex. The results of our experiments thus leave us with a sort of methodological conundrum, as both a dictionary-based gold standard and a humanbased evaluation have limitations. Using experts not only makes the evaluation expensive, but also little ecological, as it is standard practice in psycholinguistics and computational linguistics to resort to laypeople judgments. The fact that evaluating WoCs isn’t easy for laypeole may cast some shadows on the concept of WoC itself. This suggests that improving extraction methods must go hand in hand with the theoretical effort of making the very notion of WoC more precise, in order to make it an experimentally solid and testable notion.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

All texts were digitalized and automatically enriched with linguistic information allowing preliminary explorations based on NLP features. Written retellings were also manually annotated with a typology of linguistic errors. The resource is conceived to support research and computational modeling of “later language acquisition”, with an emphasis for comparative assessment of oral and written language skills across early school grades.","The use of naturalistic data to investigate child language features and development has a well- established tradition in L1 acquisition research. The most notable example is the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000), which contains transcripts of spoken interactions involving children of different ages for over 25 languages, Italian included. Yet, CHILDES data refer especially to preschool children, with only a minor section dedicated to their older mates, thus making this resource less adequate for studying how language skills evolve during early schooling. The rapid and remarkable changes children’s language undergoes before age five justify the amount of research for the earliest stages of acquisition. However, over the last two decades also “later language acquisition” has gained increasing interest (Tolchinsky, 2004), prompted by the awareness that “becoming a native speaker is a rapid and highly efficient process, but becoming a proficient speaker takes a long time” (Berman, 2004). Indeed, under explicit teaching language keeps growing through school–age years in a way that affects all domains and modalities (Koutsoftas, 2013). Regarding the methodological approach to inspect children’s data, more attention has been recently paid to text analysis techniques drawn from computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The use of a statistical parser is reported e.g. by Sagae et al. (2005) and Lu (2009) to automate sophisticated measures of syntactic development, reaching performances comparable to those obtained by manual annotation. Computational methods are also employed in diagnostic settings, e.g. to identify markers of Autism Spectrum Disorders in children’s speech by integrating features from automatic morpho–syntactic and syntactic annotation (Prud’hommeaux and Roark, 2011), as well as metrics of semantic similarity (Rouhizadeh et al., 2015). Despite the focus of this paper is on the resource, we will also present preliminary analyses aiming at showing how a NLP perspective applied to a corpus like ISACCO can serve as the starting point to conduct computational explorations at multiple levels, which may become particularly useful in view of their applicability to large–scale corpora. It should be possible to test the effect of the diamesic variation on the linguistic complexity of children’s texts and to assess changes across schooling levels (cf. section 3.1). The same can be done with respect to the “content”, to evaluate whether these variables affect text comprehension and recall. To this aim, the output of an ontology learning system can provide a mean to compare the quantity of ’matched’ ideas between the child’s retelling and the content of the heard story (cf. section 3.2), so that to identify patterns of typical development to be used for comparison e.g. in clinical settings, with children showing atypical language development.","We presented ISACCO, a new resource for the Italian language containing oral and written retellings of children attending the primary school. We showed the potentiality of NLP-based analyses to inspect child language features, both with respect to linguistic and content structure, as well as in relation to diachronic and diamesic variations. Ongoing work is devoted to enlarge the corpus, also in a longitudinal perspective, to elaborate a qualitative analysis of linguistic errors by also looking comparatively at other learner corpora, and to evaluate the impact of child language features on standard linguistic annotation tools.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

We provide an overview on the open challenges of sentiment analysis on Italian tweets. We discuss methodological issues as well as new directions for investigation with particular focus on sentiment analysis of tweets containing figurative language and entitybased sentiment analysis of micro-posts.,"Flourished in the last decade, sentiment analysis is the study of the subjectivity and polarity (positive vs. negative) of a text (Pang and Lee, 2008). Traditionally, sentiment analysis techniques have been successfully exploited for opinionated corpora, such as news (Wiebe et al., 2005) or reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004). With the worldwide diffusion of social media, sentiment analysis on micro-blogging (Pak and Paroubek, 2010) is now regarded as a powerful tool for modelling socioeconomic phenomena (O’Connor et al., 2010; Jansen et al., 2009). The success of the tasks of sentiment analysis on Twitter at SemEval since 2013 (Nakov et al., 2013; Rosenthal et al., 2014; Rosenthal et al., 2015) attests this growing trend (on average, 40 teams per year participated). In 2014, Evalita also successfully opens a track on sentiment analysis with SENTIPOLC, the task on sentiment and polarity classification of Italian Tweets (Basile et al., 2014). With 12 teams registered, SENTIPOLC was the most popular task at Evalita 2014, confirming the great interest of the NLP community in sentiment analysis on social media, also in Italy. In a world where e-commerce is part of our everyday life and social media platforms are regarded as new channels for marketing and for fostering trust of potential customers, such great interest in opinion mining from Twitter isn’t surprising. In this scenario, what is also rapidly gaining more and more attention is being able to mine opinions about specific aspects of objects. Indeed, interest in Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is increasing, and SemEval dedicates now a full task to this problem, since 2014 (Pontiki et al., 2014). Given a target of interest (e.g., a product or a brand), ABSA traditionally aimed at summarizing the content of users’ reviews in several commercial domains (Hu and Liu, 2004; Ganu et al., 2013; Thet et al., 2010). In the context of ABSA, an interesting task is represented by finer-grained assignment of sentiment to entities. To this aim, mining information from microblogging platforms also involves reliably identifying entities in tweets. Hence, entity linking on twitter is gaining attention, too (Guo et al., 2013). Based on the above observations, we discuss open issues in Section 2. In Section 3, we propose an extension of the SENTIPOLC task for Evalita 2016 by also introducing entity-based sentiment analysis as well as polarity detection of messages containing figurative language. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of our proposal in Section 4.","To conclude, we presented the entity linking and sentiment analysis tasks as related to one another, as shown in the pipeline in Figure 1, specifying that participants will be able to choose which portions of the tasks they want to concentrate on. Additionally, we would like to stress that this proposal could also be conceived as two entirely separate tasks: one on sentiment analysis at the entity level, including entity detection and linking, and one on sentiment analysis at the message level, including the detection of figurative readings, as a more direct follow-up of SENTIPOLC.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The data of the former were drawn from the LOD version of the LRE Map, while those of the latter come from manually analyzing the proceedings. The results are presented in the form of visual graphs and confirm the initial hypothesis that Italian LRs require concrete actions to enhance their visibility.","The availability of Language Resources (LRs) - such as corpora, computational lexicons, parsers, etc. - is crucial to most NLP technologies (Machine Translation, Crosslingual Information Retrieval, Multilingual Information Extraction, Automatic Document Indexing, Question Answering, Natural Language Interfaces, etc.). Recent initiatives have monitored the availability of language resources for different languages, and highlighted a digital divide between English and other languages AUTHOR. While the economic potential of English ensures that English LRs are developed and maintained not only in the academic sector but also by commercial players, the involvement of research communities for languages such as Italian is much more crucial to ensure that the necessary instruments (both data and tools) are made available for natural language processing purposes. At the same time, the production of quality LRs is just a first step; LRs must also be documented and made available to the community in such a way that they are easy to find and to use. This entails the description of every LR with a set of metadata that clarify its typology, its language, its size and licensing scheme, and the means of accessing it. Useful information in this sense can be found in the catalogues of language resources associations, such as ELRA, LDC, NICT Universal Catalogue, ACL Data and Code Repository, OLAC, LT World. These catalogues adopt a top-down approach to documenting resources and typically list resources that have reached a high level of maturity - in term of validation, documentation, clearing of IPR issues, etc. As an alternative to this approach, recent projects have been carried out within the LR community to create open, bottom-up repositories where LRs - even those under development - can be duly documented and searched. Such initiatives are for instance the META-SHARE platform AUTHOR, the CLARIN VLO AUTHOR and the LRE Map AUTHOR, with their sets of metadata. In particular the LRE Map was launched as an initiative at LREC2010 in order to crowdsource reliable and accurate documentation for the largest possible set of resources. Authors submitting to that conference were asked to document the resources they used in their paper, both the resources they created and the ones created by others. This initiative has continued and been extended to other conferences, and is now a unique source of information on existing language resources and their use in current research. The work in this paper can be set against the background of the major projects in which CNR ILC is currently involved and the aim of setting up a documentation center for language and textual resources within the framework of the CLARIN and DARIAH research infrastructures. As a CLARIN and DARIAH node, CNR ILC has the task of collecting and harmonizing metadata description of LRs at a national level, making Italian resources more visible to national and international research groups, both to the NLP and to the digital humanities communities. To this purpose, our team has inspected the panorama of LR descriptions available in the aforementioned catalogues, and in particular the LRE Map which allows us to monitor how communities build around LR use. Our hypothesis is that many of the resources that the Italian community uses and produces are not as well documented as they should be. As a consequence, many researchers may not be aware of the existence of resources that could be of use for them, and limit themselves to those they know best. In order to verify this, we carried out a cross-analysis of Italian LRs and their uses by Italian researchers, exploiting the data found in the LRE Map from the LREC2014 dataset, which is currently available in LOD format AUTHOR. Such data is compared with similar evidence gathered from the proceedings of the CLiC-it 2014 conference, which are available online. CLiC-it 2014 did not adhere to the LRE Map initiative, but comparable information has been collected by manually inspecting the papers. In what follows we will provide a brief description of the set of metadata that we used to monitor the situation with respect to Italian LRs and their use; then some results will be analyzed and discussed by means of graph-like visualizations; finally some conclusions are drawn and perspectives for future work outlined.","In this work we use visualisations to show how the Italian NLP community uses LRs in the works presented at two recent conferences of the sector (LREC2014 and CLiC-it 2014). We highlight how collaborations cluster around the use of major resources, and how networks are created by users of the same resource. From the comparison of the two datasets we can infer that the Italian panorama of language resources is rich and varied. We also confirm the prior hypothesis that Italian LRs are rather under-documented and that some positive action is needed in the direction of enhancing their visibility. As a consequence the creation of an observatory of Italian language resources, which is meant to be the nucleus of a newly established CLARIN-IT center, is more than justified. Such an observatory will actively promote the Italian LR community (both creators and users), help in improving the documentation of LRs thus making them more widely known to others and finally ensure their visibility in an international context by using all current standard metadata framework and platforms. This latter point shall involve also an active contribution to the de-fragmentation of the current situation in metadata and description practices, as well as the porting of LR descriptions to emerging channels and formats (LINGhub, RDFLOD).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

This approach was tested on a corpus essays written by Italian L1 learners of the first and second year of the lower secondary school.","Using automatic techniques to trace the learning progress of students starting from their written productions is receiving growing attention in many different research fields and for different purposes. Two different perspectives are taken into account: i.e. the analysis of the form and of the content of texts. The first scenario is mainly addressed within the writing research community where the learning progress is framed as an analysis aimed at detecting linguistic predictors of written quality across grade levels. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, different set of features (e.g. grammar features, errors, measures of lexical complexity) are automatically extracted from corpora of student essays to investigate how they relate to writing quality (Deane and Quinlan, 2010) or to other literacy processes such as reading (Deane, 2014). Human ratings of essay writing quality are also used to develop Automatic Essay Scoring systems mostly of L2 essays (Attali and Burstein, 2006). For what concerns the analysis of content of texts, traditional Knowledge Tracing systems are based on a framework for modeling the process of student learning while completing a sequence of assignments (Corbett and Anderson, 1994). These systems rely on a correctness value of each assignment given by a teacher. More recently, the Knowledge Tracing framework started to be explored by the Machine Learning (ML) community1 in Adaptive E–learning scenarios. Different ML approaches have been devised to build statistical models of student knowledge over time in order to predict how students will perform on future interactions and to provide personalized feedback on learning (Piech et al., 2015; Ekanadham and Karklin, 2015). Both the evaluation of form and content of a text share a common starting point: they imply a human ‘commitment’. In the first case, it is assumed that the analyzed essays are manually scored according to the writing quality level, in the second case, the statistical models are trained on student exercises indicating whether or not the exercise was answered correctly. In this paper, we present an innovative approach for tracking the evolution of written language competence using NLP techniques and relying on not-scored essays. Our approach focuses on the analysis of form but we combined for the first time the methods developed to tackle the form and content evaluation. Namely, we automatically extracted from written essays linguistic predictors of text quality that we used as features of a machine learning classifier to trace student developmental growth over the time. We tested this method on a corpus of written essays of Italian L1 learners collected in the first and second year of the lower secondary school. The use of not-scored essays is one of the main novelty making our approach particularly suited for less resourced languages such as the Italian language, as far as corpora of L1 students are concerned.","The results of all experiments are shown in Table 2. As a general remark, we can note that the bigger the temporal span between the tested documents, the bigger the achieved accuracy. This is due to the fact that the growth of the student writing quality is related to the temporal span. The best accuracy is achieved in the first and last text experiment (89.2%) using all features. Since the last text is the Common Prompt written at the end of the second year, this result can be biased by the features capturing prompt-dependent characteristics rather than the language competence evolution. Therefore the result could indicate an overfitting of the model. This assumption is supported by the accuracy achieved in the first and penultimate text experiment using all features (71.7%). In this case, the prompts of the written essays differ from school to school. The Feature Selection rows report the results obtained after the feature selection process. Even though in these experiments we considered only nine features (vs. the total number of about 150 features), we can note a general improvement in particular for what concerns the first and penultimate text experiment (about 8% points of improvement). These results demonstrate that these nine features are able to capture the evolution of the written language competence at different level of linguistic description. The main competence improvement captured by these features refer to: the use of verbs, in terms of both the frequency class of used verbs (during the language competence evolution the students tend to use less frequent verbs) and the verb structures produced by the students, as it is suggested by the occurrence of features capturing the use of the auxiliary verbs; basic characteristics of the sentence, such as the sentence and word length; and features referring to lexical richness (the type/token ratio feature). Interestingly, these features are in line with the results obtained by socio-pedagogical studies reported in (Barbagli et al., 2014). It is noticeable that the results of the third school are significantly the lowest ones when feature selection is used. This is due to the fact that the nine selected features do not significantly change in the student essays over the time for this school. Further investigations is part of our current studies where we are combining student background information with the competence evolution. The Feature Selection + Errors rows show the results obtained using the manually annotated errors combined with the nine selected features. As we can note, in almost all cases we obtained only a small improvement with respect to the feature selection results. This result is of pivotal importance demonstrating that the written language competence is mainly captured by relying on features that refer to the essay linguistic structure rather then by focusing on errors (also when manually annotated). This is in line with the observation of De Mauro (1977) who claims that, in particular for what concerns orthographic errors, the language competence is not related with the orthography correctness.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

Over the years, many challenging tasks have been proposed %in international campaigns as well as in EVALITA with the aim of advancing state-of-the-art technologies in different NLP areas: to mention only a few, dependency parsing AUTHOR, AUTHOR, textual entailment AUTHOR, frame labeling AUTHOR and cross-document event ordering AUTHOR, all requiring cutting-edge methods and techniques as well as innovative approaches. Following the fact that, in recent years, research is moving from the analysis of grammatical structure to sentence semantics, the attention in evaluation campaigns is shifting towards more complex tasks, combining syntactic parsing with semantically-oriented analysis. %This is the case, for instance, of the SemEval 2014 task ``Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing'' % AUTHOR, The interest of composite and articulated tasks built by combining basic tasks also lies at the applicative level, since Information Extraction architectures can realistically be seen as integrating components which carry out distinct basic tasks. Starting from the analysis of the results achieved for individual tasks in EVALITA 2014 and illustrated in AUTHOR, this paper represents a first attempt of designing a complex shared task for the next EVALITA edition, resulting from the combination of the dependency parsing and event extraction tasks for the analysis of Italian texts. Such a complex task is expected to shed new light onto old challenges by: a.) investigating whether and how the cross-fertilization of tasks can make the evaluation campaign more application-oriented, while also improving individual task results; b.) generating a new resource combining dependency and event annotation; and, c.) devising evaluation metrics more oriented towards the assessment of the applicative impact of the achieved results.","For the evaluation of subtask results, participants will be asked to submit different runs, carried out with and without the information from the other subtask: i.e. Dependency Parsing will be carried out with and without event information, and Event Extraction will be carried out with and without dependency information. This type of contrastive evaluation highlights one of the main novelties of the proposed complex task, which is not only aimed at assessing the performance of participating systems and ranking achieved results, but also at investigating impact and role of different types of information on each task depending on the adopted algorithm. A shared task organized along these lines thus creates the prerequisites for a more accurate error analysis and will possibly open up new directions of research in tackling old challenges.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

To discriminate between objects that can be manipulated with one hand and the ones that require two hands, we combine conceptual knowledge about the situational properties of the objects, which can be modeled with distributional semantic methodologies, and physical properties of the objects (i.e. their dimensions and their weights), which can be found on the web through crawling.","Distributional semantic models of word meanings are based on representations that want to be cognitively plausible and that, as a matter of fact, have been tested to produce results correlated with human judgments when concepts’ similarity and automatic conceptual categorizations are the aim of the experiment (Erk, 2012; Turney and Pantel, 2010). These approaches share the idea that two nominal concepts are similar and can be clustered in the same group if the corresponding lexemes occur in comparable linguistic contexts. Their success is also due to the expectations of the Natural Language Processing (henceforth NLP) community: both for count and predictive models of distributional semantics (Baroni et al. 2014), the core idea is that encyclopedic knowledge packed in a big corpus can improve the performance in tasks such as word sense disambiguation. However, purely textual representations turn out to be incomplete because in language learning and processing human beings are exposed to perceptual stimuli paired with linguistic ones: the old AI dream to ground language in the world requires the mapping between these two sources of knowledge. One of the aim of this paper is to understand how much physical knowledge can be retrieved in language. Can distributional representations of concrete nouns be helpful for the automatic classification of objects, when grasping possibilities are the focus? Could they help to discriminate between objects that can be manipulated with one hand and the ones that require two hands? More generally, how much knowledge about the physical world can be found in language? Inspired by the cognitive psychology literature on the topic, in this paper artifactual categories are theorized as situated conceptualization where physical and situational properties meet (Barsalou 2002). These situational properties describe a physical setting or event in which the target object occurs (as grocery store, fruit basket, slicing, picnic for apple). In an action-based categorization of objects, these kinds of properties function as a complex relational system, which links the physical structure of the object, its use, the background settings, and the design history (Chaigneau et al. 2004). Situational properties can be derived from distributional semantic models, where each co-occurrence vector approximates the encyclopedic knowledge about its referent. A complementary, but more action-oriented idea, is the psychological notion of affordance as the possibilities for actions that every environmental object offers (Gibson 1979). Conceptual information concerning objects’ affordances can be partially acquired through language, considering verb-direct object pairs as the linguistic realizations of the relations between the actions that can be performed by an agent, and the objects involved in those actions. Affordance verbs, intended as verbs that select a distinctive action for a specific object, can be discovered through statistical measures in corpora (Russo et al. 2013). The main assumption of this paper is that the primary affordance for grasping of an artifact largely depends on its physical properties, in particular dimensions and weight. Such features are found in e-commerce websites. Extracting these values for many similar items, for example for all instances of ``plate'', may help to automatically represent average dimensions for that object. However, combining this knowledge with situational properties of objects modeled as distributional semantics vectors can help understanding if they can be combined. This issue is relevant for the implementation of a module that automatically classifies grasping possibilities for objects in embodied robotics. The paper is structured as follow: section 2 reports on the manual annotation of grasping possibilities for a set of 143 artifacts, discussing the definition of the gold standard that will be the dataset for classification experiments in section 3. Section 4 presents conclusions and ideas for future work.","In this paper we test how distributional representations of nouns denoting artifacts can be combined with physical information about their dimensions and weights automatically extracted from an e-commerce website and with co-occurrence information about their affording parts as found in a corpus of do-it-yourself instructions. The starting hypothesis - concerning grasping possibilities as basic manipulative actions for object - was that they are conceptually a combination of situational and physical properties. \\ As a consequence, we expect the best performance from a mixed features models. This hypothesis is not confirmed; for the two-classes dataset (``onehand"" VS ``twohand"") both physical knowledge and distributional semantics vectors give good resultsbut they don't improve the classifier's performance when combined. \\ These results are in line with the current trend to mix textual and visual features from computer vision algorithms (Bruni et al. 2012) in order to go beyond the limitations of purely textual semantic representations that cannot encode information about colors, dimensions, shapes etc. As future work we plan to integrate the features used for the experiment in this paper with representations of words as bag of visual words derived from the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm (Lowe 1999) that in computer vision helps to detect and describe local features in images.",22,Distributional Semantics

The collection has been driven by the detection of the hashtag mainly used by the participants to the debate, while the annotation has been based on polarity but also extended with the target semantic areas involved in the debate.","The recent trends in sentiment analysis are towards hybrid approaches or to computational semantics oriented frameworks where linguistic and pragmatic knowledge are encompassed for describing a global notion of communication. This notion includes e.g. context, themes, dialogical dynamics in order to detect the affective content even if it is not directly expressed by words, like, for instance, when the user exploits figurative language (e.g. irony, metaphor or hyperbole) or, in general, when the communicated content does not correspond to words meaning but depends also on other communicative behaviors. On this perspective, a particular interesting domain is related to the political debates and, in particular, in the specific form that such debates assumes in social media, which strongly differentiate them from other kinds of classical conversational contexts AUTHOR. In the last years social media, and in particular Twitter, have been used in electoral campaigns by different actors involved in the process: by campaign staffs in order to disseminate information, organize events; by the news media in order to inform and promote news content; and by voters to express and share political opinions. Therefore recently many studies focused on understanding the phenomenon, by studying the effect of this technology on the election outcomes AUTHOR, its possible use to gauge the political sentiment AUTHOR and the users' stance on controversial topics AUTHOR, or by studying the networks of communication in order to investigate the political polarization issue AUTHOR.

However, discourse parsing sub-tasks such as the detection of connectives and their sense classification have achieved satisfactory level of performance. In this paper we investigate the relevance of discourse connective features for tasks such as sentiment polarity classification. In the literature, discourse connectives are usually considered as modifiers of a polarity of a sentence or a word. In this paper we present experiments on using automatically extracted connectives and their senses as low-level features and as an approximation of a discourse structure for polarity classification of reviews. We demonstrate that, despite insignificant contributions to bag-of-words, the discourse-only models perform significantly above chance level.","Discourse analysis has applications in many Natural Language Processing tasks; Webber et al. (2011) and Taboada and Mann (2006) among others list opinion mining, summarization, information extraction, essay scoring, etc. Availability of large discourse annotated resources such as Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008a) and Rhetorical Structure Theory - Discourse Treebank (RST-DT) (Carlson et al., 2002) made it possible to develop statistical discourse parsers (e.g. (Marcu, 2000; Lin et al., 2014; Ghosh et al., 2011; Stepanov and Riccardi, 2013)). However, independent of the theory (RST or PDTB) the problem of end-to-end discourse parsing is far from being solved; thus, downstream application of these parsers yields mixed results. In this paper we focus on PDTB approach to discourse parsing, which can be roughly partitioned into detection of discourse relations, extractions of their argument spans and sense classification. In CoNLL 2015 Shared Task on Shallow Discourse Parsing (Xue et al., 2015) the best system (Wang and Lan, 2015) achieved F1 of 24 on the end-to-end parsing on a blind test set using strict evaluation that required exact match of all the spans and labels. Having such low end-to-end performances makes it difficult to apply PDTB-style discourse parsing to other NLP tasks. However, if we consider discourse parsing tasks individually, detection of discourse connectives and their classification into senses achieve high results: ≈ 90 for discourse connective detection and similarly ≈ 90 for connective sense classification (Stepanov et al., 2015). Thus, the output of these tasks could be used in other NLP applications. Discourse connectives are essentially function words and phrases. Function word frequencies is a popular feature in NLP tasks such as authorship detection (Kestemont, 2014), and it has also been applied to sentiment polarity classification (Abbasi et al., 2008). Resolving connective usage and sense ambiguities (Section 2), they are potentially able to provide more refined features than simple function word counts. On the other hand, grouping connectives with respect to their senses yields more coarse features. In this paper we explore the utility of these features for sentiment polarity classification of movie reviews (Pang and Lee, 2004).","We have described experiments on using lowlevel discourse-based features for sentiment polarity classification. The general observations are (1) discourse connectives in isolation generally significantly outperform the chance baseline; and (2) using even the most general top-level senses provides performance gains. This is particularly notable due to the fact that discourse connective detection and relation sense classification do not generalize well across domains (Prasad et al., 2011). Discourse connectives signal explicit discourse relations, which are only 53% of all discourse relations in PDTB. Implicit discourse relations (47%), which have the same senses, are much harder to deal with. Given the state of the art on implicit relation sense classification, detection and application of all the discourse relations is not yet possible. However, as indicated by the experiments on using n-grams of relation senses, even approximations can contribute.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Zampolli'' in Pisa, to the Italian section of MultiWordNet, developed at Bruno Kessler Foundation and to a LWN created with the same criteria of AGWN and linked to Minozzi's LWN AUTHOR and AUTHOR, developed at the University of Verona. In this way the user is allowed to find the equivalents of a set of synonyms into different languages. The AGWN can be freely accessed through a Web interface, which allows enabled users to add or delete words in the synsets, adapt the glosses and validate the lexico-semantic relations. we mean the three WN: AGWN, IWNand PWN. We first created AGWN by bootstrapping Greek-English pairs from bilingual dictionaries and by assigning Greek words to PWN synsets associated to the corresponding English translations. As a drawback of this method, a large number of synsets and lexico-semantic relations are spuriously over-generated by English homonymy and polysemy. As exposed in AUTHOR, to have PWN as a pivoting resource links through ILI AUTHOR AGWN to IWN propagates the same drawback to other connected WN in CoPhiWn.

The experiment consisted in combining in different ways a phrase-based translation model, as typically conceived in Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation, with a small set of bilingual pairs of such catenae. The main goal is to study, though still in a preliminary fashion, how such units can be of any use in improving automatic translation quality.","The hybridization of machine translation systems in order to benefit from both statistical-based and linguistically-motivated approaches is becoming a popular trend in translation field. Such trend is well described in a number of surveys (CostaJussá and Farrús, 2014; Costa-Jussá and Fonollosa, 2015) and witnessed by recent initiatives in NLP community, such as the HyTra workshop series1 . The motivations to this choice can be manifold, but essentially lie in the need to either reduce the costs - both in terms of time and resources - of building a fully rule-based system, or to integrate statistical models or SMT outputs with linguistic knowledge, as this could be useful to capture complex translation phenomena that data-driven approaches cannot handle properly. Such phenomena are often called translational divergences, or even shifts (Catford, 1965), and usually involve a large number of linguistic and extralinguistic factors. Our main research interest is the study of such shifts, in particular from a syntactic point of view, and of how such linguistic knowledge could be of any use to overcome the current shortcomings in machine translation. The preliminary experiment presented here is therefore guided by the second motivation mentioned above: our basic assumption is that supplementing translation models in classical PhraseBased Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) with syntactically-motivated units extracted from parallel treebanks can lead to improvements in machine translation accuracy. This was already demonstrated, for example, in Tinsley (2009), where syntactic contituents were used to improve the translation quality of a PBSMT system. However, instead of a constituency paradigm, we focused on a more dependency-oriented syntactic unit, namely the one of catena. The choice of a dependency-paradigm in general is mainly dictated by the acknowledged fact that dependencies can better represent linguistic phenomena typical of morphologically rich and free-word order languages (see e.g. (Covington, 1990; Goldberg et al., 2013)). On the other hand, to capture translation shifts of various nature, it is necessary to consider a syntactic unit that goes beyond the single node, as also recently pointed out, e.g., in Deng et al. (2015); hence the introduction of the notion of catena in our study. In order to verify our assumption, we carried out a preliminary experiment performing several translation tasks, with Italian and English as language pair. For this purpose, a typical phrase-based SMT system was built, using for training the translation model various combinations of baseline SMT configurations and pairs of catenae automatically extracted from a parallel treebank, i.e. ParTUT, and then automatically aligned. The remainder of this paper is thus organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the notion of catena, in Section 3 we describe our use of catenae in this experiment, while in Section 4 we describe the training configurations chosen and discuss the results.","The paper presented a small experiment on the combined use of linguistic knowledge - in the form of syntactically-motivated translation units - and statistical model provided by state-of-the-art machine translation techniques. The results reported here are to be considered preliminary, as they suffer from the absence of systematic procedures and data that could not have been applied so far due to lack of time and proper resources. Still, considering these shortcomings, translation evaluation, at least in one direction, produced promising results. There is however a lot of work to do to under this respect in order to effectively improve translation quality with the help of such linguistic information; for example by scaling up this experiment using a larger set of external data, or using different training configurations, so as to have multiple sources of comparison for final assessments and considerations.",10,Machine Translation

We describe the collection methodology, which is based on theoretical hypotheses about the communicative behavior of actors in the debate, the annotation scheme and the results of its application to the collected dataset. Finally, a comparative analysis of data is presented.","The widespread diffusion of social media in the last years led to a significant growth of interest in the field of opinion and sentiment analysis of user generated contents AUTHOR. The first applications of these techniques were focusing on the users' reviews for commercial products and services (e.g. books, shoes, hotels and restaurants), but they quickly extended their scope to other interesting topics, like politics. Applications of sentiment analysis to politics can be mainly investigated under two perspectives: on one hand, many works focus on the possibility of predicting the election results through the analysis of the sentiment conveyed by data extracted from social media AUTHOR; on the other hand, the power of social media as ``a trigger that can lead to administrative, political and societal changes"" AUTHOR is also an interesting subject to investigate AUTHOR. This paper mainly focuses on the last perspective. Our aim is indeed the creation of a manual annotated corpus for sentiment analysis to investigate the dynamics of communication between politics and civil society as structured in Twitter and social media. We focused from the beginning our attention mainly on Twitter because of the relevance explicitly given to this media in the communication dynamics of the current government. In order to describe and model this communicative behavior of the government, we assume the theoretical framework known in literature as framing, which consists in making especially salient in communication some selected aspect of a perceived reality AUTHOR. The data selected to create the corpus have been chosen by analyzing in Twitter and other contexts the diffusion of three hashtags, i.e. #labuonascuola, #italicum, #jobsact. In particular, we focus on #labuonascuola (the good school), which was coined to communicate the school reform proposed by the actual government. A side effect of our work is the development of a new lexical resource for sentiment analysis in Italian, a currently under-resourced language. Among the existing resources let us mention Senti-TUT AUTHOR, which has been exploited together with the TWITA corpus AUTHOR for building the training and testing datasets in the SENTIment POLarity Classification shared task AUTHOR recently proposed during the last edition of the evaluation campaign for Italian NLP tools and resources AUTHOR. The Sentipolc's dataset includes tweets collected during the alternation between Berlusconi and Monti on the chair of Prime Minister of the Italian government. The current proposal aims at expanding the available Italian Twitter data annotated with sentiment labels on the topic of politics, and it is compatible with the existing datasets w.r.t. the annotation scheme and other features. The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the dataset mainly focusing on collection. In the section 3 we describe the annotation applied to the collected data and the annotation process.

We compare two such approaches that can be applied to any multilingual parallel corpus, as long as large inter-linked sense inventories exist for all the languages involved.","Clwsd aims to automatically disambiguate a text in one language by exploiting its differences with other language(s) in a parallel corpus. Since the introduction of a dedicated task in SemEval-2013 AUTHOR, work on clwsd has increased, but parallel corpora have been used to this purpose for a long time; see for instance AUTHOR, AUTHOR, AUTHOR, AUTHOR and, more recently, AUTHOR and AUTHOR. AUTHOR exploit the semantic information inferred by translation correspondences in parallel corpora as a clue for WSD; AUTHOR represent the milestone behind one of the approaches here evaluated, i.e. sense disambiguation exploiting the polysemic differential between two languages. As AUTHOR pointed out, wsd is so challenging mainly because most approaches require large amounts of high-quality sense-annotated data. Ten years later, the knowledge acquisition bottleneck still needs to be addressed for most languages. Given an ambiguous word in a parallel corpus, having access to the semantic space (here intended as all the senses associated to its lemma) of each of its aligned translations allows one to exploit similarities and differences in the languages involved and, consequently, to make more educated guesses of the intended meaning. This simple, yet powerful, intuition can be decisive, if not in disambiguating all words, at least in reducing ambiguity and thus the human effort in annotating a whole text from scratch. We explore two approaches of annotating a multilingual parallel corpus in English, Italian and Romanian built upon sc AUTHOR. We describe it in Section 2 along with a brief outline of the first approach, sp, which was pioneered by AUTHOR. In Section~sec:requirements we list the requirements and the necessary preprocessing steps common to both approaches. In Section 2 we present the second approach, multilingual si. Section 3 discusses the results achieved on the multilingual corpus with each method. We conclude in Section 4 anticipating future work.","To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to disambiguate a parallel corpus by using multilingual SI. The more languages are considered, the more ambiguity should be reduced and the better SI is expected to perform. In future work, we plan to include the Japanese SemCor (Bond et al., 2012) to test our hypothesis that translations from a different language family will discriminate further. We also plan to use a different parallel corpus built on open translations of The Adventure of the Speckled Band by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. We will also try to calculate SFS from untagged text, following McCarthy and Carroll (2003). Furthermore, we are investigating alternative ways to solve the ambiguity left whenever SI does not lead to a single synset; for instance, we plan to apply some implementation of Lesk (Lesk, 1986) on the subset found by SI. Finally, we aim to port to WN 3.0 the sense clustering carried out by Navigli (2006) to perform a coarse-grained evaluation, which would ignore minor sense distinctions. An initial comparison with Babelfly (Moro et al., 2014) would certainly be enlightening as well.

Our network uses a sliding window of word contexts to predict tags. It relies on a simple word-level log-likelihood as a cost function and uses a new recurrent feedback mechanism to ensure that the dependencies between the output tags are properly modeled. %These choices make our network simple and computationally efficient. The evaluation on the Evalita 2009 benchmark shows that our DNN performs on par with the best NERs, outperforming the state of the art when gazetteer features are used.","Named Entity (NE) recognition is the task of detectings phrases in text, e.g., proper names, which directly refer to real world entities along with their type, e.g., people, organizations, locations, etc.~see, e.g., AUTHOR.%The NER task has been first proposed by the Message Understanding Conference (MUC 6, MUC 7) Conference on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2002, 2003) and Automatic Content Extraction program (ACE 2002, 2005). Recently the NER task has been extended to other languages, e.g., Italian (Evalita 2007, 2009). Most NE recognizers (NERs) rely on machine learning models, which require to define a large set of manually engineered features. % For example, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) system for English AUTHOR uses a simple averaged perceptron and a large set of local and non-local features. Similarly, the best performing system for Italian AUTHOR combines two learning systems that heavily rely on both local and global manually engineered features. Some of the latter are generated using basic hand-crafted rules (i.e., suffix, prefix) but most of them require huge dictionaries (gazetteers) and external parsers (POS taggers and chunkers). While designing good features for NERs requires a great deal of expertise and can be labour intensive, it also makes the taggers harder to adapt to new domains and languages since resources and syntactic parsers used to generate the features may not be readily available. Recently, DNNs have been shown to be very effective for automatic feature engineering, demonstrating SOTA results in many sequence labelling tasks, e.g., AUTHOR, also for Italian language AUTHOR. In this paper, we target NERs for Italian and propose a novel deep learning model that can match the accuracy of the previous best NERs without using manual feature engineering and only requiring a minimal effort for language adaptation. In particular, our model is inspired by the successful neural network architecture presented by AUTHOR to which we propose several innovative and valuable enhancements: (i) a simple recurrent feedback mechanism to model the dependencies between the output tags and (ii) a pre-training process based on two-steps: (a) training the network on a weekly labeled dataset and then (b) refining the weights on the supervised training set. Our final model obtains 82.81 in F1 on the Evalita 2009 Italian dataset AUTHOR, which is an improvement of + 0.81 over the AUTHOR system that won the competition. Our model only uses the words in the sentence, four morphological features and a gazetteer. Interestingly, if the gazetteer is removed from our network, it achieves an F1 of 81.42, which is still on par with the previous best systems yet it is simple and easy to adapt to new domains and languages.","In this paper, we propose a new DNN for designing NERs in Italian. Its main characteristics are: (i) the RCWN feedback method, which can model dependencies of the output label sequence and (ii) a pre-training technique involving a weakly supervised dataset. Our system is rather simple and efficient as it involves only one model at test time. Additionally, it does not require time-consuming feature engineering or extensive data processing for their extraction. In the future, we would like to apply rerankers to our methods and explore combinations of DNNs with structural kernels.",1,Language Models

Even though great attention has been given to polarity recognition, the research in emotion detection has had to rely on small emotion resources. In this paper, we present a methodology to build emotive lexicons by jointly exploiting vector space models and human annotation, and we provide the first results of the evaluation with a crowdsourcing experiment.","In recent years, computational linguistics has seen a rising interest in subjectivity, opinions, feelings and emotions. Such a new trend is leading to the development of novel methods to automatically classify the emotions expressed in an opinionated piece of text (for an overview, see Liu, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008), as well as to the building of annotated lexical resources like SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010), WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) or EmoLex (Mohammad and Turney, 2013). Emotion detection can be useful in several applications, e.g. in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) it can be used to track sentiments towards companies and their services, products or others target entities. Another kind of application is in Government Intelligence, to collect people’s emotions and points of views about government decisions. The common trait of most of these approaches is a binary categorization of emotions, articulated along the key opposition between positive and negative emotions. Typically, then, these systems would associate words like “rain” and “betray” to the same emotion class in that they both evoke negative emotions, without further distinguishing between the sadness-evoking nature of the former and the anger-evoking nature of the latter. Emotion lexica, in which lemmas are associated to the emotions they evoke, are valuable resources that can help the development of detection algorithms, for instance as knowledge sources for the building of statistical models and as gold standards for the comparison of existing approaches. Almost all languages but English lack a high-coverage high-quality emotion inventory of this sort. Building these resources is very costly and requires a lot of manual effort by human annotators. On the other hand, connotation is a cultural phenomenon that may vary greatly between languages and between different time spans (Das and Bandyopadhyay, 2010), so that the simple transfer of an emotive lexicon from another language cannot be seen as nothing else than a temporary solution for research purposes. Crowdsourcing is usually able to speed the process and dramatically lower the cost of human annotation (Snow et al., 2008; Munro et al, 2010). Mohammad and Turney (2010, 2013) show how the “wisdom of the crowds” can be effectively exploited to build a lexicon of emotion associations for more than 24,200 word senses. For the creation of their lexicon, EmoLex, they selected the terms from Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard, 1986), General Inquirer (Stone et al.,1966), WordNet Affect Lexicon (Strapparava and Valitutti., 2004) and Google n-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) and they exploited a crowdsourcing experiment, in order to obtain, for every target term, an indication of its polarity and of its association with one of the eight Plutchik (1994)’s basic emotions (see below). The methodology proposed by Mohammad and Turney (2010, 2013), however, cannot be easily exported to languages where even small emotive lexica are missing. Moreover, a potential problem of a lexicon built solely on crowdsourcing techniques is that its update requires a re-annotation process. In this work we’re proposing an approach to address these issues by jointly exploiting corpus-based methods and human annotation. Our output is ItEM, a high-coverage emotion lexicon for Italian, in which each target term is provided of an association score with eight basic emotion. Given the way it is built, ItEM is not only a static lexicon, since it also provides a dynamic method to continuously update the emotion value of words, as well as to increment its coverage. This resource will be comparable in size to EmoLex, with the following advantages: i) minimal use of external resources to collect the seed terms; ii) little annotation work is required to build the lexicon; iii) its update is mostly automatized. This paper is structured as follows: In section 2, we present ItEM by describing its approach to the seed collection and annotation step, its distributional expansion and its validation. Section 3 reports the results obtained from the validation of the resource using a crowdsourcing experiment.","What we are proposing with ItEM is a reliable methodology that can be very useful for languages that lack lexical resources for emotion detection, and that is at the same time scalable and reliable. Moreover, the resulting resource can be easily updated by means of fully automatic corpus-based algorithms that do not require further work by human annotators, a vantage that can turn out to be crucial in the study of a very unstable phenomenon like emotional connotation. The results of the evaluation with crowdsourcing show that a seed-based distributional semantic model is able to produce high quality emotion scores for the target words, which can also be used to dynamically expand and refine the emotion tagging process.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Given a negative/speculative cue, the algorithm tries to extend the boundary of the scope towards the left and the right, by navigating through the parse tree. We report on experiments with the algorithm using the Bioscope corpus.","Clinical notes are a vast potential source of information for healthcare systems, from whose analysis valuable data can be extracted for clinical data mining tasks, for example confirming or rejecting a diagnosis, predicting drug risks or estimating the effectiveness of treatments. Clinical notes are written in informal natural language, where, besides annotating evidence collected during a patient visit, physician report historical facts about the patient and suggested or discarded hypothesis. Annotations about dismissed hypotheses or evidence about the absence of a phenomenon are particularly abundant in these notes and should be recognized as such in order to avoid misleading conclusions. A standard keyword based search engine might for example return many irrelevant documents where a certain symptom is mentioned but it does not affect the patient. Medical records are currently analysed by clinical experts, who read and annotate them manually. In some countries like Spain, it has become mandatory by law for all medical records to be annotated with the mentions of any relevant reported fact, associated with their official ICD9 code. To assign the right ICD9 code, it is of critical importance to recognize the kind of context of each mention: assertive, negative or speculative. In the BioScope corpus, a collection of bio-medical text, one out of eight sentences indeed contains negations (Vincze et al. (2008)). In order to automate the process of annotation of clinical notes, the following steps can be envisaged: 1. recognition of medical entities, by exploiting techniques of named entity (NE); 2. normalization and association to a unique official concept identifier to their key terminology from UMLS metathesaurus (O. Bodenreider, 2004); 3. detection of negative or speculative scope. NE recognition and normalization steps can be performed by relying on shallow analysis of texts (for an exhaustive and updated overview of the state of the art, see Pradhan et al. (2014)). The identification of negative or speculative scope, instead, cannot just rely on such simple text analysis techniques, and would require identifying relations between parts, by means of a deeper syntactic-semantic analysis of sentences. This work presents a novel algorithm that learns to determine the boundaries of negative and speculative scopes, by navigating the parse tree of a sentence and by exploiting machine learning techniques that rely on features extracted from the analysis of the parse tree.","We have described a two-step approach to speculation and negation detection. The scope detection step exploits the structure of sentences as represented by its dependency parse tree. The novelty with respect to previous approaches also exploiting dependency parses is that the tree is used as a guide in the choice of how to extend the current scope. This avoids producing spurious scopes, for example discontiguous ones. The algorithm also may gather partial subtrees of the parse. This provides more resilience and flexibility. The accuracy of the algorithm of course depends on the accuracy of the dependency parser, both in the production of the training corpus and in the analysis. We used a fast transition-based dependency parser trained on the Genia corpus, which turned out to be adequate for the task. Indeed in experiments on the BioScope corpus the algorithm achieved accuracy scores above the state of the art.",20,In-domain IR and IE

We explore how these changes affect the accuracy of dependency parsers, performing comparative tests on various versions of the treebank. Despite significant changes in the annotation style, statistical parsers seem to cope well and mostly improve.","Universal Dependencies (UD) is a recent initiative to develop cross-linguistically consistent treebank annotations for several languages that aims to facilitate multilingual parser development and cross-language parsing (Nivre, 2015). An Italian corpus annotated according to the UD annotation scheme was recently released, as part of version 1.1 of the UD guidelines and resources. The UD-it v1.1 Italian treebank is the result of conversion from the ISDT (Italian Stanford Dependency Treebank), released for the shared task on dependency parsing of Evalita-2014 (Bosco et al., 2013 and 2014). ISDT is a resource annotated according to the Stanford dependencies scheme (de Marneffe et al. 2008, 2013a, 2013b), obtained through a semi-automatic conversion process starting from MIDT (the Merged Italian Dependency Treebank) (Bosco, Montemagni, Simi, 2012 and 2014). MIDT in turn was obtained by merging two existing Italian treebanks, differing both in corpus composition and adopted annotation schemes: TUT, the Turin University Treebank (Bosco et al. 2000), and ISST-TANL, first released as ISST-CoNLL for the CoNLL-2007 shared task (Montemagni and Simi, 2007). UD can be considered as an evolution of the Stanford Dependencies into a multi-language framework and introduce significant annotation style novelties (deMarneffe et al., 2014). The UD schema is still evolving with many critical issues still under discussion, hence it is worthwhile to explore the impact of the proposed standard on parser performance, for example to assess whether alternative annotation choices might make parsing easier for statistically trained parsers. For Italian we are in the position to compare results obtained in the Evalita 2014 DP parsing tasks with the performance of state-of-the-art parsers on UD, since both treebanks share a large subset of sentences. Moreover, since UD is a larger resource than ISDT, we can also evaluate the impact of increasing the training set size on parser performance. Our aim is to verify how differences in annotation schemes and in the corresponding training resources affect the accuracy of individual state-of-the-art parsers. Parser combinations, either stacking or voting, can be quite effective in improving accuracy of individual parsers, as proved in the Evalita 2014 shared task and confirmed by our own experiments also on the UD. However our focus here lies in exploring the most effective single parser techniques for UD with respect to both accuracy and efficiency.","We have analyzed the effects on parsing accuracy throughout the evolution of the Italian treebank, from the version used in Evalita 2014 to the new extended and revised version released according to the UD framework. General improvements have been noted with all parsers we tested: all of them seem to cope well with the inversion of direction of prepositional complements and copulas in the UD annotation. Improvements may be due as well to the harmonization effort at the level of PoS and morpho-features carried out in the process. Graph based parsers still achieve higher accuracy, but the difference with respect to a transition based parser drops when third order features are used. A transition-based parser still has an advantage in raw parsing speed (i.e. disregarding speed-ups due to multithreading) and is competitive for large scale applications.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

The purpose of the analysis is to discuss the hypothesis of the constitution of a multilingual dictionary and translator emoji, through a subsequent procedure of selection and fixing of conventional semantic values. The translation dimension makes it possible to evaluate the capacity of the image, beyond the specificities of languages, to express common and universal meanings, so that they can be formed as models in the perspective of the vehicular language and the interlingua. The analysis will move from the notion of short writings as defined in Chiusaroli and Zanzotto 2012a, 2012b, and now in www.scripturebrevi.it","Today's popularity of emojis in digital environments is not adequately reflected in rational uses, due to the high degree of vagueness implicit in the figure. Despite the widespread statements and the continuous announcements about the advent of a new universal idiom for images, it remains the practicability in fact of such an expressive language, evidently lacking in the structural plane of the langue. The absence of a shared system, in fact, establishes a constant condition of semantic ambiguity that precludes the affirmation and uses of the desired general code, 1 recalling and reproducing the destiny of historical graphic traditions, which, as is known, have experienced the limits of the pictographic systems or started their linguistic specialization. While the emoticon - a sequential combination of characters for facial expression such as:-) - is more and more configured as a solid disambiguing element for the communication of emotional components in the context of writing to counter ""Digitized,"" useful the indeterminateness entrusted to the word in written form with the addition of the fundamental trait/prosodic recall, on the contrary appears poorly defined the semantics of the emojis, the increasingly rich series of keyboard symbols that reproduce referents and ""objects"" of speech through distinct pictographic forms. Precisely the iconic character, in fact, intended to ensure understanding beyond, or against, the specific language barriers, gives rise rather to variable solutions of reading of the same sign, with effects on the correct or unambiguous transmission/understanding of the message.","Precisely the reference to biunivocal correspondence appears as the most significant element for a method that intends to consider emojis not only as elements of the act of words (unique, always different), but as signs of a formalized and shared code, as coherent, unique and rational as possible. Beyond the idiosyncratic or creative dimension, beyond the vagueness and equivocity of individual use, the hypothesis of writing in emoji as a vehicle system must deliver to the practice a code suitable for international and multilingual communication, a system therefore constructed by a preliminary selection according to a correct balance of coherence and effectiveness, and capable of reproducing ideas and reducing the superficial variety to grasp the structure, or sense, deep. The priority assigned to the definition of the interlingua in emoji will take due account of specificity and occasionalisms as indispensable in the communicative act historically and culturally placed and, as such, included in the inventory according to the hierarchical perspective of semantic relations (hyponyms, hyperonymies) and formal, syntagmatic and associative. Different roles will be assigned to non-universally transferable or translatable meanings. Therefore, according to a taxonomic criterion, specific pictograms will be placed, when expressive of specific historical-cultural values, and nevertheless traceable to the basic forms, against which they will place themselves as extensions by addition of modifying elements. This is a method already adopted by keyboard systems in the recent release of emojis related to the representation of ethnic notations such as skin color, hair, and other physical characteristics or ethical-social orientation, which are significantly expanding the prepared repertoire, thus abandoning the symbolic figure and adapting the pictographic dimension to the increasingly faithful reproduction of realia. The goal of the common language-writing, historically sought by universalist programs since the Cartesian language era, can thus find today an appropriate opportunity for affirmation in writing in emoji: a powerful new writing for popularity, and based on the assumption of shared and globalized communication. The expansion of the social network becomes a limiting factor of the inevitable arbitrary drift, but it is above all the anchoring to the linguistic plane, through the glossatory instrument, to guarantee the constitution of the code, translatable into linguistic signs, as such bound to the horizon of thought that the individual language prepares, like every partial and imperfect language, and yet precisely for this rigorous and effective, the only one able to allow communication.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

There is no doubt that nowadays the enormous availability of data on the web has significantly facilitated the constitution and distribution of the linguistic corpora both monolingual and multilingual. In fact, corporations are an essential resource for the linguistic field, especially for contrasting analyses between two or more languages, for teaching foreign languages and for lexicographic and translation studies. In the context of computational linguistics, linguistic corpora, and in particular parallel ones, acquire an absolute importance, especially for applications such as machine translation, the extraction of terminologies or semantic disambiguation. However, not all languages equally take part in parallel bilingual or multilingual corpora. In fact, Arabic is a language that has limited participation in parallel corpora, especially specialized ones. It is a phenomenon that can be considered as a possible effect of the modest availability on the web of parallel texts in Arabic and other languages, as well as the complexity of the Arabic morphological system.

The linguistic approach includes Part Of Speech (POS) tagging of the corpus texts in the two languages in order to formulate syntactic patterns to identify candidate terms. After that, the candidate terms will be ranked by statistical association measures which here represent the statistical knowledge. After the creation of two MWTs lists, one for each language, the parallel corpus will be used to validate and identify translation equivalents.","The development of robust approaches aiming at terminology extraction from corpora plays a key role in a lot of applications related to NLP, such as information retrieval, ontology construction, machine translation, etc. The main approaches adopted to terms extractions are linguistic-based, statistical-based, and hybrid-based. While the linguistic approach tries to identify terms by capturing their syntactic properties, called synaptic compositions (Pazienza et al., 2005), the statistical one uses different association measures (Church et al., 1989) to determine the degree of association or cohesiveness between the multiword terms (MWTs) components. There is no doubt that the use of a hybrid approach, which combines linguistic and statistical information to identify candidate terms, can guarantee best results rather than relying basically on one approach (Frantzi et al., 1999). In this paper we present our approach to extract MWTs from an Italian-Arabic parallel corpus of legal texts. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we present related works; Section 3 describes our proposed approach to extract MWTs from parallel corpora; Section 4 presents the experiments and the results; and Section 5 explains the Conclusion and future works.","In this paper we presented our proposed approach to extract multi-word terms from parallel corpora in the legal domain. Regarding the monolingual extraction, we can observe that the results in Italian are a little higher than those in Arabic and this is due to the morphological complexity of the Arabic language which has an impact on the POS tagging performance and therefore on the MWTs extraction. Regarding the bilingual extraction we note that the mediocre recall in SMT system is due to the legal peculiarity of the corpus terms which do not always correspond to the Google translation, while the low recall in the method based on the MWTs index can be attributable to the limited reordering between the two languages. We believe that our attempt can be considered the first one of its type in the Arabic-Italian bilingual domain terminology extraction, and that the results are encouraging. Future work will focus on improving the performance of the approach.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis
121_2015,2015,nolatex,Federico Giusfredi,Phrase Structure and Ancient Anatolian languages Methodology and challenges for a Luwian syntactic annotation,ENG,1,0,0,Università di Verona,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Verona,"For the Marie Skłodowska Curie (MSCA) funded project “SLUW – A computer aided study of the (morpho)syntax of Luwian” a collection of phrase structure trees from the Luwian corpus is currently being prepared. Luwian is a language belonging to the Anatolian branch of Indo-European; its structures are different from those of English and the language itself is partly obscure. The present paper will describe some special needs, open challenges and methodologies relevant for the annotation of phrasestructure of Luwian.","Annotating a dead language, especially if lacunae and obscure sequences occur frequently in the corpus, is a challenging task. In the case of phrase-structure trees, those challenges complicate the usual issues represented by “trapping” (an element nested within the boundaries of a phrase it does not belong to) and standard discontinuous phrases. The language under investigation is Luwian, an ancient member of the Anatolian branch of Indo-European, the second largest one after Hittite by number of documents. It was written using two different writing systems (the cuneiform script and the Anatolian hieroglyphs). The attestations cover a time span of almost one millennium, between the 16th and the 8th centuries BCE (cf. Melchert, 2003). Syntactically speaking, it features a rather strict SOV word-order as far as some classes of constituents are concerned (Wackernagel particles, inflected verb at the end, left-branching of genitives and attributes); while a few elements can move with relative freedom (for instance adverbs, indirect case NPs and PPs with respect to the position of a direct object). The final goal of the SLUW project, a Horizon2020 MSCA funded two-year research plan hosted by the University of Verona (2015-2017) is to produce a general study of the syntax (and morpho-syntax) of the language; in order to do so, a significant selection of sentences (about 30% to 50% of the corpus) will be collected and annotated in order to produce phrase-structure trees that will help highlight syntactic patterns. Theory-free phrase structure annotation is more suitable than Universal Dependencies for this kind of approach, as the boundaries of linear and non-linear phrases as well as their canonical or non-canonical position within the sentence are more easily identified. Since the structure of Luwian is very different from the one of English – Anatolian languages had peculiar features that must be accounted for – the starting point for the development of a POS tagset, the “label-tag” context-sensitive system of the Penn Treebank II, requires to be modified in order to better match the object of study.","The creation of phrase-structure trees for ancient languages with structural peculiarities that make them very different from modern ones may require specific modifications to the usual parsing tagsets. Such modifications may occur both on the phrase and on the word levels. In order to minimize the challenges and maximize flexibility, a context-sensitive syntax with both labels and functional tags is more suitable than a rigid one; for instance functional markers for case inflection may apply to several different categories of labels (all nouns, adjectives and pronouns). As far as discontinuous phrases are concerned, in the analysis of dead languages they may be natural linguistic phenomena, but they may also be the result of either poor text preservation or limited understanding of given segments. In order to avoid inaccurate nesting, a system of coindexing appears to be the most advisable solution to guarantee a good degree of accuracy in the linguistic representation and a regular treatment of the linearity issues.",5,Latin Resources

The extensive homography caused by diacritic omission considerably increases the number of alternative parses of any morphological analyzer that makes no use of contextual information. Many such parses are spurious and can be filtered out if diacriticization, i.e. the process of interpolating diacritics in written forms, takes advantage of a number of orthographic, morpho-syntactic and semantic constraints that operate in Arabic at the word level. We show that this strategy reduces parsing time and makes morphological analysis of written texts considerably more accurate.","Arabic is a morphologically rich language, where a lot of information on morpho-syntactic and semantic relationships among words in context is directly expressed at the word level 1 . Some prepositions, conjunctions and other particles are morphologically realized as proclitics, while all pronouns are enclitics. Orthographic, morphological and syntactic characteristics of Arabic contribute to increasing the level of ambiguity of written word forms, which is made even more complex by the unsystematic use of diacritical markers in the Arabic script2. In this paper we suggest that spelling rules, morpho-syntactic and semantic constraints should be jointly evaluated as early as possible in parsing an Arabic text. In particular, the analysis of spelled-out forms requires simultaneous use of morpho-syntactic and semantic information to define constraints on NLP, and “interpolate” missing vowels/diacritics (diacriticization) in Arabic written texts.","Automatic text processing requires annotation of different levels of linguistic analysis: morphological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic. For some languages, like English, it makes sense to analyze those levels in a serial way, by taking the output of an early level of analysis as the input of the ensuing level. Purpose of this article is to demonstrate that specific characteristics of Arabic appear to recommend a different approach. Inflectional, derivational and non-concatenative characteristics of Arabic morphology require interdependence and interaction between different levels of analysis for segmentation of spelled-out forms and their analysis to be adequate. This suggests that Arabic processing may require substantial revision of traditional NLP architectures. For improvement and future work, we plan to complete and refine language resources for Arabic. As a further step, we consider including other contextual factors, such as knowledge about the immediate syntactic context of a word token, as restrictions on diacriticization.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

For certain tasks however it is important to represent contrasting aspects such as polarity, opposite senses or idiomatic use of words. We present a method for computing discriminative word embeddings can be used in sentiment classification or any other task where one needs to discriminate between contrasting semantic aspects. We present an experiment in the identification of reports on natural disasters in tweets by means of these embeddings.","Distributional Semantic Models (DSM) that represent words as vectors of weights over a high dimensional feature space (Hinton et al., 1986), have proved very effective in representing semantic or syntactic aspects of lexicon. Incorporating such representations has allowed improving many natural language tasks. They also reduce the burden of feature selection since these models can be learned through unsupervised techniques from plain text. Deep learning algorithms for NLP tasks exploit distributional representation of words. In tagging applications such as POS tagging, NER tagging and Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), this has proved quite effective in reaching state of art accuracy and reducing reliance on manually engineered feature selection (Collobert & Weston, 2008). Word embeddings have been exploited also in constituency parsing (Collobert, 2011) and dependency parsing (Chen & Manning, 2014). Blanco et al. (2015) exploit word embeddings for identifying entities in web search queries. Traditional embeddings are created from large collections of unannotated documents through unsupervised learning, for example building a neural language model (Collobert et al. 2011; Mikolov et al. 2013) or through Hellinger PCA (Lebrét and Collobert, 2013). These embeddings are suitable to represent syntactic similarity, which can be measured through the Euclidean distance in the embeddings space. They are not appropriate though to represent semantic dissimilarity, since for example antonyms end up at close distance in the embeddings space In this paper we explore a technique for building discriminative word embeddings, which incorporate semantic aspects that are not directly obtainable from textual collocations. In particular, such embedding can be useful in sentiment classification in order to learn vector representations where words of opposite polarity are distant from each other.","We have presented the notion of discriminative word embeddings that were designed to cope with semantic dissimilarity in tasks like sentiment analysis or multiclass classification. As an example of the effectiveness of this type of embeddings in other applications, we have explored their use in detecting tweets reporting alerts or notices about natural disasters. Our approach consisted in using a classifier trained on a corpus of annotated tweets, using discriminative embeddings as features, instead of the typical manually crafted features or dictionnaries employed in tweet classification tasks as sentiment analysis. In the future, we plan to explore the use a convolutional network classifier, also provided by DeepNL, without any additional features, as Severyn and Moschitti (2015) have done for the SemEval 2015 task on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.",22,Distributional Semantics

Comparing Latin Vallex and Latin WordNet,ENG,3,1,0,Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Milan,"Following a comparison of the different views on lexical meaning conveyed by the Latin WordNet and by a treebank-based valency lexicon for Latin, the paper evaluates the degree of overlapping between a number of homogeneous lexical subsets extracted from the two resources.","Several lexical resources are today available for many languages, ranging from dictionaries to wordnets, ontologies, valency lexica and others. Although such resources deal with the same basic constituents, i.e. lexical entries, these are organized according to different criteria, corresponding to different views on lexicon and, in particular, on lexical meaning. On the one hand, a widespread approach to lexical meaning comes from the basic assumption of frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982), according to which the meaning of some words can be fully understood only by knowing the frame elements that are evoked by those words. Following such an assumption, there is a large use of the concept of valency and of labels for semantic roles in lexical resources. The degree of semantic granularity of the set of semantic roles used is what mostly distinguishes resources like PropBank, VerbNet and FrameNet one from the other. On the other hand, a lexical resource largely used in both theoretical and computational linguistics is WordNet, which is centred on the idea of synonymy in the broad sense. Words are included in synsets, which are sets of words “that are interchangeable in some context without changing the truth value of the proposition in which they are embedded” (from the glossary of WordNet: http://wordnet.princeton.edu). Despite their differences, these two views are not incompatible. Over the last decade, several attempts at linking different lexical resources together have been launched. One of the best known projects is Semlink, which makes use of a set of mappings to link PropBank, VerbNet, FrameNet and WordNet (Palmer, 2009). Pazienza et alii (2006) study the semantics of verb relations by mixing WordNet, VerbNet and PropBank. Shi and Mihalcea (2005) integrate FrameNet, VerbNet and WordNet into one knowledge-base for semantic parsing purposes. Regarding the relations between valency lexica and wordnets, Hlavácková (2007) describes the merging of the Czech WordNet (CWN) with the database of verb valency frames for Czech VerbaLex, whose lexical entries are related to each other according to the CWN synsets. Hajič et alii (2004) use CWN while performing the lexico-semantic annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank for Czech (PDT), which is in turn exploited to improve the quality and the coverage of CWN. In order to pick out the semantic constraints of the verbal arguments in the Polish WordNet (PolNet), the valency structure of verbs is used as a property of verbal synsets, because it is “one of the formal indices of the meaning (it is so that all members of a given synset share the valency structure)” (Vetulani and Kochanowski, 2014, page 402). Despite a centuries-long tradition in lexicography, the development of state-of-the-art computational lexical resources for Latin is still in its infancy. However, some fundamental resources were built over the last decade. Among them are a WordNet and a treebank-based valency lexicon. In this paper, we present the first steps towards a comparison of these two resources, by evaluating the degree of overlapping of a number of their lexical subsets.","Although a valency lexicon like LV accounts for the different senses that one word may have by assigning it different frame entries, these are not as much semantically defined as the LWN synsets are. However, there is a certain degree of correspondence between these two resources: the more/less fine-grained a frame-based LV subset is, the higher/lower its overlapping with the LWN synsets. For instance, LV includes 1,060 frame entries of verbs formed by an Actor and a Patient: such a subset is both too large and semantically coarse-grained to allow for a sufficient overlapping with the LWN synsets. For this reason, while evaluating the overlapping degree between LV and LWN, we have first focussed on a number of “semantically rich” LV subsets. The evaluation metrics that we used are still very simple. The values of the n-tuples must be weighted at evaluation stage (one sextuple is “heavier” that one triple) and the lexical subsets of LWN must be extended beyond synonymy, by exploiting also other relations between words, like hyperonymy and hyponymy.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The perspective is interdisciplinary: moving from pragmatic premises of communication, we investigate strategies and branding techniques through the use of the conceptual category of 'short writings' as in www.scripturebrevi.it.","A well-established tradition of semiotic studies, cognitive linguistics and psychology indicates the human mind as ""narrant."" So Roland Barthes (1969: 7): ""[...] the story is present in all times, in all places, in all societies; the story begins with the very history of humanity; it does not exist, there never existed in any place a people without stories [...] the story is there as life is. The reflection on the structures of narrative started by Propp and the Russian formalists in the 20s was resumed in the second half of the last century by structuralists such as Barthes, Todorov and Genette, among others, who gave their contribution to the elaboration of a narrative theory starting from the assumption that the recounting, and the recounting, are constant phenomena in the history of man, behaviors to the human being connatural.","In this work we analyzed some case studies of storytelling and their short writings (claim, headline, hashtag) through which those stories were conceived and disseminated on the web to be intercepted in the magnum sea of digital content.

Our quality estimation models are evaluated in a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition setting (the transcription of English TED talks). In this setting, we apply different learning algorithms and strategies and measure performance in two testing conditions characterized by different distributions of “good” and “bad” instances. The positive results of our experiments pave the way towards the use of binary estimators of ASR output quality in a number of application scenarios.","Accurate and cost-effective methods to estimate ASR output quality are becoming a critical need for a variety of applications, such as the large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems used to transcribe audio recordings from different sources (e.g. YouTube videos, TV programs, corporate meetings), or the dialogue systems for human-machine interaction. For obvious efficiency reasons, in some of these application scenarios, ASR output quality cannot be determined by means of standard reference-based methods. Indeed, besides the fact that reference transcripts are not always available, quality indicators should often be computed at run-time to ensure quick response. This motivates research towards alternative “reference-free” solutions. To cope with this problem, word-level confidence estimates have been used in the past either to measure how an ASR system is certain about the quality of its hypotheses (Wessel et al., 1998; Evermann and Woodland, 2000; Mangu, 2000; Xu et al., 2010, inter alia) or to automatically detect ASR errors (Seigel, 2013; Seigel and Woodland, 2014; Tam et al., 2014). The reliance on confidence information and the emphasis on the word/sub-word level mark the major differences between such prior works and our research, which aims to give an objective assessment of ASR output quality: i) at the whole utterance level and ii) without the constraint of having access to the system’s decoding process. This information, in fact, is not always accessible, as in the case of the increasingly large amount of captioned audio/video recordings that can be found on the Web. This advocates for the development of “confidence-independent” quality estimation methods. These problems have been addressed by Negri et al. (2014), who proposed the task of predicting the word error rate (WER) of an automatically transcribed utterance.1 Results indicate that even with a relatively small set of black-box features (i.e. agnostic about systems’ internal decoding strategies), the predictions closely approximate the true WER scores calculated over reference transcripts. Experiments, however, are limited to a regression problem and further developments either disregard its natural extension to binary classification (Jalalvand et al., 2015), or address it without the same exhaustiveness of this work (C. de Souza et al., 2015). The automatic assignment of explicit good/bad labels has several practical applications. For instance, instead of leaving to the user the burden of interpreting scores in the [0, 1] interval, easilyinterpretable binary quality predictions would help in tasks like: i) deciding if an utterance in a dialogue application has been correctly recognized, ii) deciding if an automatic transcription is good enough for the corresponding audio recording or needs manual revision (e.g. in subtitling applications), iii) selecting training data for acoustic modelling based on active learning, and iv) retrieving audio data with a desired quality for subsequent processing in media monitoring applications. To support these applications, we extend ASR quality estimation to the binary classification setting and compare different strategies. All of them significantly outperform the trivial approach based on thresholding predicted regression scores (our first contribution). The best solution, a stacking method that effectively exploits the complementarity of different models, achieves impressive accuracy results (our second contribution).","We investigated the problem of assigning informative and unambiguous binary quality labels (good/bad) to automatically transcribed utterances. Aiming at an application-oriented approach, we developed a reference-free and confidence-independent method, which has been evaluated in different settings. Our experiments on English TED talks’ transcriptions from the IWSLT campaign show that our best stacking models can successfully combine the complementarity of different strategies. With a balanced accuracy ranging from 86.33% to 88.40%, the full-fledged classifiers that combine black-box and glass-box (i.e. confidence-based) features bring the problem close to its solution. With results in the range 75.90%-78.47%, our reference-free and confidence-independent models provide a reliable solution to meet the demand of cost-effective methods to estimate the quality of the output of unknown ASR systems.",13,Multimodal

We defined about 4,250 formal rules for rewriting dependencies and token tags as well as an algorithm for treebank rewriting able to avoid rule interference. At the end of this process a large portion of the whole treebank was automatically converted, with very few errors, leaving only a small amount of work to be done manually.","The availability of large annotated language resources is a prerequisite for the development of reliable automatic annotation tools using machine learning techniques. Automatic tools able to enrich real texts with sentence syntactic structures are central instruments in Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines for a reliable annotation of text corpora. Modern NLP parsers heavily depend on complex training phases performed by examining manually annotated treebanks. Data sparsity, especially for low-resourced languages, seriously affect parsers performances, forcing scholars to annotate more and more data. Since 2012 the state-of-the-art for Italian treebanks were not so satisfactory: three different projects and institutions produced three treebanks using different background theories, different formats and also different syntactic structures. They were the Italian Syntactic Semantic Treebank - ISST AUTHOR, the Turin University Treebank - TUT AUTHOR and the Venice Italian Treebank - VIT AUTHOR. Table Pre2012 outlines the main characteristics of these treebanks at that time. TABLE ISST and TUT were used as gold standards in various evaluation campaigns (CoNLL2007 and EVALITA series), but only in 2012 the research groups developing such treebanks started to integrate them into a unique resource. In 2012 the Merged Italian Dependency Treebank - MIDT - was created and released by fusing the two resources AUTHOR and in the following years this project evolved such resource inserting it into the big Universal Dependency - UD - project AUTHOR, through another intermediate step, the Italian Stanford Dependency Treebank - ISDT AUTHOR. During this process some other annotated texts were added to the treebank leveraging its size to around 315,000 tokens and 12,700 sentences (UD\_Italian, v1.3). This paper describes the latest effort for the Italian treebank merging: the conversion, harmonisation and integration of the written sections of VIT, not previously included into ISST, with the other two resources for reaching a global amount of about 600,000 tokens and 23,000 sentences syntactically annotated. For practical issues we decided to convert VIT into the MIDT format and then use the set of already designed automatic procedures and checking programs to transform it into the final UD format. There are other notable works aimed at treebank conversion in various languages, for example we can cite AUTHOR for Italian.","This paper presents the procedure we developed to convert VIT, one Italian treebank, into a different format. Most of the described conversion procedure rely on an automatic algorithm based on formal rules that is able to automatically convert the 81.4\% of the treebank. This procedure can be, in principle, adaptable to any conversion between different dependency treebank formats. The formal rules has been manually defined by using a well known dependency search procedure, Semgrex from StanfordNLP group, properly extended to handle rewriting rules and the final result was manually evaluated to test the effectiveness of the written rules obtaining a very small error rate. To the best of our knowledge, there is no general purpose tool available to automatise this task for dependency graphs. We can find some powerful converters in literature but they are usually tied to specific pair of tagsets (often tailored to the Penn treebank) AUTHOR, and cannot be easily adapted to general needs, or are devoted to tree manipulation, for example the tool `Tregex' AUTHOR. Even if the described procedure can convert a large part of the treebank automatically with a very small quantity of errors, the conversion certainly needs a careful manual analysis to complete the task and check the new treebank for remaining mistakes. The VIT treebank contains a lot of specific and peculiar dependency subgraph for representing phenomena in a very detailed way. Trying to capture all these different variations into formal rules can result in a very large rule set mostly composed of rule that handle single cases. We stopped the production of new rules when this situation arose. We wish to thank Rodolfo Delmonte and Maria Simi for their precious suggestions and explanations for the analysis of linguistic phenomena and for defining the conversion process.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

We propose a method that works on texts containing at least one high resource language and at least one low resource language. The intuition is to use supervised and weakly supervised methods for the high resource languages and unsupervised methods for the low resource languages to arrive at a better language segmentation; supervised methods derived from high-resource languages single out these languages while unsupervised algorithms tackle the remaining unknown language(s) and cluster them by similarity. The presented approach is extendable to more than one high-resource language, in which case a separate language model has to be trained for each language; the approach is also applicable to more than one low-resource language, where the unsupervised methods are expected to produce an accurate split of all languages present.","We have introduced a hybrid language segmentation method which leverages the presence of high-resource language content in mixed language historical documents and the availability of the necessary resources to build language models, coupled with an unsupervised language model induction approach which covers the low-resource parts. We have shown that our method outperforms the previously introduced unsupervised language model induction approach. We have also found that our method seems to work both on longer texts and on shorter texts, whereas the approach described in AUTHOR seems to be working better on shorter texts such as Twitter messages. The local context approach yields inconclusive results. This is most probably due to the similarity measure used and the small size of the context. We would need, if possible, a better similarity measure for small language models or another method of evaluating the word in respect to its context.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

This approach does not require annotated data and is based on existing domain lexical resources and unsupervised machine learning techniques.,"The digitization of medical documents in hospitals has produced plenty of information which should be adequately organized. While part of the material, mainly including international scientific publications, is in English, increasingly more material is being created in the language of the country of the medical institution. The main part of the local language material is represented by patient records. They contain important information not only for preparing care plans or solve problems for the particular patient, but also to extract statistics useful for research and also for logistics administration. Automatic processing of such repositories still can not be straightforwardly applied. One of the principal issues to be solved is the automatic extraction of relevant information, usually consisting in entities and relations connecting them AUTHOR. In the cited work, we extensively discuss a domain entity and relation recognition system for Italian. Such step is at the basis of more sophisticated analyses, including semantics-based indexing of documents for improved retrieval, advanced query based information extraction, and the application of ontology-based strategies for privacy protection. General tools, such as TextPro AUTHOR, are not adapted for technical domains such as the medical one, as they are trained on generic documents, rather than domain-specific ones. Furthermore, a lot of tools are available for English and only a few of them have been ported to Italian. Another problem to take into account is the occurrence, in clinical records, of typos and nonstandard abbreviations, in addition to the most usual acronyms. Last but not least, passing from text to knowledge processing raises tricky privacy problems. In fact, especially but not only in small hospitals, obscuring the patient names is not sufficient to hide their identity as the medical information reported in records are often sufficient to reconstruct a precise profiling of the patients. Therefore, ad hoc solutions represent the only way to build effective applications to solve this kind of problems. For example, not only domain entities and relations can help identifying potentially dangerous information, but also ontological information can be exploited to better protect patient privacy AUTHOR. Again, ontologies construction and population are based on entity and relation extraction. Efforts to port systems to languages different from English require, first of all, the development of lexical resources for the considered language. However, they are not sufficient, because of the intrinsic differences between languages. A widely adopted way to tackle such difficulties is represented by machine learning approaches. Although supervised approaches are usually more effective, they require large corpora of annotated data, which are quite expensive to obtain, as they require that domain experts invest time in a long and tedious annotation activity. In the medical domain, staff should invest part of their precious time to annotate data with information about the presence and the type of domain relevant entities and relations in records to be used for the training phase. Things would be much easier if domain experts are only required to check an automatically produced annotation. We therefore propose to integrate a knowledge-based and a text mining approaches to develop an application which requires the expert intervention only to check on medical and pharmaceutical labels associated to groups of relations. More in detail, we propose here to integrate the systems discussed in AUTHOR and in AUTHOR: the former adopts domain dependent lexical resources to extract entities and unsupervised machine learning approaches to decide where relations occur in the text. The latter clusters and labels the extracted relations with an approach based on lexical semantics. The paper is organized with Section~sec:approach detailing the approach implementation and Section~sec:conclusions for conclusions and future works.","The research presented in this paper was partially supported by the national projects CHIS - Cultural Heritage Information System (PON), and BIG4H - Big Data Analytics for E-Health Applications (POR).",20,In-domain IR and IE

However, most of the current APE techniques have only been tested in controlled batch environments, where training and test data are sampled from the same distribution and the training set is fully available. In this paper, we propose an online APE system based on an instance selection mechanism that is able to efficiently work with a stream of data points belonging to different domains. Our results on a mix of two datasets show that our system is able to: i) outperform state-of-the-art online APE solutions and ii) significantly improve the quality of rough MT output.","Nowadays, machine translation (MT) is a core element in the computer-assisted translation (CAT) framework AUTHOR. The motivation for integrating MT in the CAT framework lies in its capability to provide useful suggestions for unseen segments, thus increasing translators productivity. However, it has been observed that MT is often prone to systematic errors that human post-editing has to correct before publication. The by-product of this ``translation as post-editing'' process is an increasing amount of parallel data consisting of MT output on one side and its corrected version on the other side. Besides being used to improve the MT system itself AUTHOR, this data can be leveraged to develop automatic MT quality estimation tools AUTHOR and automatic post-editing (APE) systems AUTHOR. The APE components explored in this paper should be capable not only to spot recurring MT errors, but also to correct them. Thus, integrating an APE system inside the CAT framework can further improve the quality of the suggested segments, reduce the workload of human post-editors and increase the productivity of translation industries. In the last decade many studies on APE have shown that the quality of the machine translated text can be improved significantly by post-processing the translations with an APE system AUTHOR. These systems mainly follow the phrase-based machine translation approach where the MT outputs (with optionally the source sentence) are used as the source language corpus and the post-edits are used as the target language corpus. Although these standard approaches showed promising results, they lack of the ability to continuously update their inner models by incorporating human feedback from a stream of data. To address this problem, several online systems have been proposed in MT, but only few of them have been applied to the APE scenario AUTHOR, only in a controlled working environment where they are trained and evaluated on homogeneous/coherent data sets. In this paper, we propose a novel online APE system that is able to efficiently leverage data from different domains. Our system is based on an instance selection technique that is able to retrieve the most relevant training instances from a pool of multi-domain data for each segment to post-edit. The selected data is then used to train and tune the APE system on-the-fly. The relevance of a training sample is measured by a similarity score that takes into account the context of the segment to be post-edited. This technique allows our online APE system to be flexible enough to decide if it has the correct knowledge for post-editing a sentence or if it is safer to keep the MT output untouched, avoiding possible damages. The results of our experiments over the combination of two data sets show that our approach is robust enough to work in a multi-domain environment and to generate reliable post-edits with significantly better performance than a state-of-the-art online APE system.","We addressed the problem of building a robust online APE system that is able to efficiently work on a stream of data points belonging to different domains. In this condition, our APE has shown its capability to continuously adapt to the dynamics of diverse data processed in real-time. In particular, the instance selection mechanism allows our APE method to reduce the number of %harming wrong modifications, which result in significant improvements in precision over the state-of-the-art online APE system, and thus making it a viable solution to be deployed in a real-word CAT framework.",10,Machine Translation

We distinguish between narrative and descriptive zones and, within them, among finer-grained units contributing to the overall communicative purpose of the text. Furthermore, we show that the segmentation in CZs could provide valuable cues for the recognition of time relations between events.","The logical structure of a document, i.e. its hierarchical arrangement in sections, paragraphs, sentences and the like, reflects a functional organization of the information flow and creates expectations on where the desired information may be located. As it is often the case, however, breakups in sections and paragraphs are motivated by style or even arbitrary choices. The segmentation of the text in Content Zones (CZs, henceforth), i.e. functional categories contributing to the overall message or purpose, as induced by the genre of the text, provides more reliable and fine-grained cues to access the structure of its types of functional content. Previous attempts to annotate CZs have mainly focused on highly standardized texts like scientific articles AUTHOR and scheduling dialogues AUTHOR, or on semi-structured texts AUTHOR like film reviews AUTHOR. Other work AUTHOR adopts the theory of discourse modes AUTHOR to distinguish between the different types of text passages in a text document. To the best of our knowledge, no efforts have been undertaken to devise an annotation scheme targeting the functional structure of news articles in terms of their content: the inverted pyramid structure, i.e. the gathering of key details at the beginning, followed by supporting information in order of diminishing importance, is too coarse-grained to be effectively used for information extraction purposes. Our hypothesis is that modeling the document's content via CZs could yield benefits for high-level NLP tasks such as Temporal Processing, Summarization, Question-Answering, among others. 
In addition to this, CZs qualify as a higher-level analysis of a text/discourse which captures different information with respect to Discourse Relations.

Finally, we would like to automatize the process of annotation and test the effectiveness of the approach in texts belonging to different genres, e.g. novels AUTHOR and historical essays. Even the basic distinction between narrative and descriptive zones could facilitate the performance of more complex NLP tasks by targeting the relevant informational zones.

These mainly exploit text for searching and retrieving food facilities, e.g., \emph{restaurants}, \emph{caff\'e}, \emph{pizzerias}. The main features of such applications are: the location and quality of the facilities, where quality is extrapolated by the users' reviews. More recent options also enable search based on restaurant categorization, e.g., \emph{Japanese}, \emph{Italian}, \emph{Mexican}. In this work, we introduce Appetitoso, an innovative approach for finding restaurants based on the dishes a user would like to taste rather than using the name of food facilities or their general categories.","In late 2000's, we assisted to the explosion of TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel site, which offers advice about hotel and restaurants. In few years, it has revolutionized the restaurant industry, allowing its users to search restaurants by location, broad food categories (e.g., Mexican, Italian, French), reviews and ratings provided by other users. However, the user expectation has evolved overtime: looking for restaurants is not enough anymore, people are now considering finer-grained properties of food, e.g., a particular way to cook a dish along with its specific ingredients. Thus, there is a clear gap between what the market proposes and the emerging trends. In this work, we present Appetitoso, a search engine that seeks for restaurants based on dishes. This approach is designed to help users to find their restaurants having already a specific dish preference in mind, using fine-grained properties of the dish. Appetitoso integrates state-of-the-art search engines, such as BM25, with a domain specific knowledge base describing properties and similarity relations between different Italian dishes. This knowledge is very useful, e.g., in our experiments, we show that it greatly boosts dish retrieval. Appetitoso is available as a mobile phone application (e.g., Android and iOS) and website, released in 2014 for two languages, English and Italian. It is an end-to-end application for finding restaurants offering the desired dish. We evaluated it using a set of 547 popular queries typed by its users in the cities of Rome, Milan and Florence. In the reminder of this paper, in Section 2, we report related work on systems for automatic food recommendation, In Section 3, we introduce Appetitoso, its knowledge base and the food search engine.

The aims of the search engine is to provide the users with a way of searching restaurants by dishes rather than just using the restaurants' address or cuisine type. We show that, given the complexity of dish naming, a semistructured database for dishes can largely improve BM25. Overall, Appetitoso shows good performance, e.g., achieving 88.76\% in MAP. In the future, we would like to include more complex unstructured data such as the description of the dishes and also explore the possibility of word embeddings for the food domain. Moreover, it is also important increase the coverage of the system by adding more dishes to the FKB. Even if the manual annotation is important, and in some cases fundamental, it represents a bottleneck for the expansion process. For this reason, in the future it would be necessary consider approaches to automatically extract dish entities from text (e.g. NER for food).

In this paper, we propose an approach to argument relation prediction based on supervised learning of linguistic and semantic features of the text. We test our method on the CorEA corpus of user comments to online newspaper articles, evaluating our system's performances in assigning the correct relation, i.e., support or attack, to pairs of arguments. We obtain results consistently better than a sentiment analysis-based baseline (over two out three correctly classified pairs), and we observe that sentiment and lexical semantics are the most informative features with respect to the relation prediction task.","The argument mining AUTHOR research area has recently become very relevant in computational linguistics. Its main goal is the automated extraction of natural language arguments and their relations from generic textual corpora, with the final goal of providing machine-readable structured data for computational models of argument and reasoning engines. Two main stages have to be considered in the typical argument mining pipeline, from the unstructured natural language documents towards structured (possibly machine-readable) data: (i) argument extraction, i.e., to detect arguments within the input natural language texts, and (ii) relation extraction, i.e., to predict what are the relations holding between the arguments identified in the first stage. The relation prediction task is extremely complex, as it involves high-level knowledge representation and reasoning issues. The relations between the arguments may be of heterogeneous nature, like attack, support or entailment AUTHOR. The increasing amount of data available on the Web from heterogeneous sources, e.g., social network posts, forums, news blogs, and the specific form of language adopted there challenge argument mining methods, with the aim to support users to understand and interact with such a huge amount of information. In this paper, we address this issue by presenting an argument relation prediction approach for Italian. We test the method on the CorEA corpus AUTHOR of user comments to the news articles of an Italian newspaper, annotated with agreement (i.e., support) and disagreement (i.e., attack) relations. We extract argument-level features from the CorEA comment (i.e., argument) pairs, and we train our system to predict the support and attack relations.","In this paper, we have presented a supervised approach for argument relation prediction for Italian, mainly relying on features including semantics and sentiment.

We build several models by exploiting Temporal Random Indexing and the Google Ngram dataset for the Italian language. Each proposed method is evaluated on the ability to automatically identify meaning shift over time. To this end, we introduce a new dataset built by looking at the etymological information reported in some dictionaries.","Languages can be studied from two different and complementary viewpoints: the diachronic perspective considers the evolution of a language over time, while the synchronic perspective describes the language rules at a specific point of time without taking its history into account AUTHOR. In this work, we focus on the diachronic approach, since language appears to be unquestionably immersed in the temporal dimension. Language is subject to a constant evolution driven by the need to reflect the continuous changes of the world. The evolution of word meanings has been studied for several centuries, but this kind of investigation has been limited by the low amount of data on which to perform the analysis. Moreover, in order to reveal structural changes in word meanings, this analysis has to explore long periods of time. Nowadays, the large amount of digital content opens new perspectives for the diachronic analysis of language. This large amount of data needs efficient computational approaches. In this scenario, Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) represent a promising solution. DSMs are able to represent words as points in a geometric space, generally called WordSpace AUTHOR simply analysing how words are used in a corpus. However, a WordSpace represents a snapshot of a specific corpus and it does not take into account temporal information. Since its first release, the Google Ngram dataset \cite{michel2011quantitative} has inspired a lot of works on the analysis of cultural trends and linguistic variations. Moving away from mere frequentist approaches, Distributional Semantic Models have proved to be quite effective in measuring a meaning shift through the analysis of variation of word co-occurrences. One of the earlier attempts can be dated to AUTHOR, where a co-occurrence matrix is used to model the semantics of terms. In this model, similarly to ours, the cosine similarity between vectors representing a term in two different periods is exploited as a predictor of the meaning shift: low values suggest a change in the words that co-occur with the target. The co-occurrence matrix is computed with local mutual information scores and the context elements are fixed with respect to the different time periods, hence the spaces are directly comparable. However, this kind of direct comparison does not hold when the vector representation is manipulated, like in reduction methods (SVD), or learning approaches (word2vec). In these cases, each space has its own coordinate axis. Then, some kind of alignment between spaces is required. To this end, AUTHOR use orthogonal Procrustes, while AUTHOR earn a transformation matrix. In this paper, we propose an evolution of our previous worK AUTHOR for analysing word meanings over time. This model, differently from those of AUTHOR and AUTHOR creates different WordSpaces for each time period in terms of the same common random vectors; then, the resulting word vectors are directly comparable with one another. In particular, we propose an efficient method for building a DSM model which takes into account temporal information relying on a very large corpus: the Google Ngram for the Italian language. Moreover, for the first time, we provide a dataset for the evaluation of word meaning change points detection specifically set up for the Italian language. The paper is structured as follows: Section methodology provides details about our methodology, while Section \ref{sec:evaluation} describes the dataset that we have developed and the results of a preliminary evaluation. Section conclusion reports final remarks and future work.","In this work we proposed several methods based on Random Indexing for the diachronic analysis of the Italian language.

In this work, we experiment with the application of Distributional Semantics to a corpus of Italian literature to test if words distribution can convey stylistic cues. To verify our hypothesis, we have set up an Authorship Attribution experiment. Indeed, the results we have obtained suggest that the style of an author can reveal itself through words distribution too.","Stylometry, that is the application of the study of linguistic style, offers a means of capturing the elusive character of an author's style by quantifying some of its features. The basic stylometric assumption is that each writer has certain stylistic idiosyncrasies (a ``human stylome'' AUTHOR) that define their style. Analysis based on stylometry are often used for Authorship Attribution (AA) tasks, since the main idea behind computationally supported AA is that by measuring some textual features, we can distinguish between texts written by different authors AUTHOR. One of the less investigated stylistic feature is the way in which authors use words from a semantic point of view, e.g. if they tend to use more, when dealing with polysemous words, a certain sense over the others, or senses that differ (even slightly) from the one that's more commonly used (as it happens, typically, in poetry). A possible approach to the analysis of this characteristic is to consider the textual contexts in which certain words appear. According to Distributional Semantics (DS), certain aspects of the meaning of lexical expressions depend on the distributional properties of such expressions, or better, on the contexts in which they are observed AUTHOR. The semantic properties of a word can then be defined by inspecting a significant number of linguistic contexts, representative of the distributional behavior of such word. In this work we would like to investigate if the analysis of the distribution of words in a text can be exploited to provide a stylistic cue. In order to inspect that, we have experimented with the application of DS to the stylometric analysis of literary texts belonging to a corpus constituted by texts pertaining to the work of six Italian writers of the late nineteenth century. In the following, Section 2 gives a short insight on the state of the art of computational stylistic analysis, Section 3 describes the approach together with the corpus used to conduct our investigation and Section 4 discuss about results. Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions and outlines some possible future works.","In this paper we investigated the possibility that an analysis of the semantic distribution of words in a text can be potentially exploited to get cues about the style of an author. In order to validate our hypothesis, we conducted a first experiment on six different Italian authors. The results seem to suggest that the way words are distributed across a text, can provide a valid stylistic cue to distinguish an author's work. Of course, it is not our intent, with this paper, to define new methods for enhancing state-of-the-art authorship attribution algorithms. Our research will focus, in the next steps, in detecting and providing useful indications about the style of an author. This can be done by highlighting, for example, atypical distributions of words (e.g. with contrastive methods) or by analysing their distributional variability. Furthermore, it could be interesting to use a different distributional measure, than the cosine, to test our hypothesis.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

In this context, a topic-centric approach for expert search is proposed, addressing the extraction of expertise topics, their semantic grounding with the LOD cloud, and their connection to IR experimental data.","The importance of research data is widely recognized across all scientific fields as this data constitutes a fundamental building block of science.

So despite the importance of data to IR, the field does not share any clear ways of exposing, enriching, and re-using experimental data as LOD with the research community. Therefore, the main contributions of this paper are to: \item define an RDF model of the scientific IR data with the aim of enhancing their discoverability and easing their connections with the scientific production related to and based on them; \item provide a methodology for automatically enriching the data by exploiting relevant external entities from the LOD cloud.

Future work will concern the application of these semantic modeling and automatic enrichment techniques to other areas of the evaluation workflow. For example, expert profiling and topic extraction could be used to automatically improve and enhance the descriptions of the single experiments submitted to an evaluation campaign, which are typically not very rich and often cryptic---for example ``second iteration with tuned parameters'' as description---and to automatically link experiments to external resources, e.g., describing the used components, such as stemmers or stop lists, and systems. Finally, the RDF model defined within DIRECT opens up the possibility of integrating established DL methodologies for data access and management which increasingly exploit the LOD paradigm AUTHOR.

Principles of correlative learning offer a set of dynamic equations that are key to modelling this complex dynamic at a considerable level of detail. We use these dynamic equations to simulate acquisition of Modern Greek conjugation, and we compare the results with evidence from German and Italian. Simulations show that different Greek verb classes are processed and acquired differentially, depending on their degrees of formal transparency and predictability. We relate these results to psycholinguistic evidence on Modern Greek word processing, and interpret our findings as supporting a view of the mental lexicon as an emergent integrative system.","Issues of morphological (ir)regularity have traditionally been investigated through the prism of morphological competence, with particular emphasis on aspects of the internal structure of complex words (AUTHOR). Within this framework, one of the most influential theoretical positions is that morphologically, phonologically, or/and semantically transparent words are always processed on-line through their constituent elements, whereas irregular, idiosyncratic (non-transparent) forms are stored (and retrieved) as wholes in the lexicon (Pinker and Prince, 1994). Likewise, AUTHOR assume that the past tense formation of regular verbs in English requires on-line application of an affixation rule (e.g. walk > walk+ed), while irregular past tense forms, involving stem allomorphy (e.g. drink > drank), are retrieved from the lexicon. Modern Greek introduces an interesting variation in this picture. First, stem allomorphy and suffixation are not necessarily mutually exclusive processes, but coexist in the same inflected forms (e.g. lin-o ‘I untie’ > e-li-s-a ‘I untied’, aɣap(a)-o ‘I love’ > aɣapi-s-a ‘I loved’). Secondly, affixation rules may select unpredictable stem allomorphs: aɣap(a)-o ‘I love’ > aɣapi-s-a ‘I loved’, for(a)-o ‘I wear’ > fore-s-a ‘I wore’, xal(a)-o ‘I demolish’ > xala-s-a ‘I demolished’. These cases suggest that inflectional (ir)regularity is not an all-or-nothing notion in Greek. Different inflectional processes may compound in the same words to provide a challenging word processing scenario AUTHOR. From this perspective, Modern Greek offers the opportunity to test traditional hypotheses of grammar and lexicon interaction in word processing and learning, to explore the potential of single, distributed mechanisms in addressing word processing challenges AUTHOR.","Data analysis highlighted a hierarchy of regularity-by-transparency effects that appear to have consequences on morphological processing. In particular, the evidence offered here emphasises the role of formal preservation of the stem (or stem transparency) in the paradigm as a key facilitation factor for morphological processing. Our case study is focused on a distinguishing characteristic of Greek conjugation: all verb paradigms, both regulars and irregulars, involve (unpredictable) stem allomorphy in past-tense formation. Hence, the difference between regular and irregular verbs could not be attributed to the presence or absence of stem allomorphy as is the case with other languages, such as English and Italian (and, to a lesser extent, German), but rather to the type of stem allomorphy itself. The ﬁnding (Figure 2) that stem-ﬁnal systematic change, as in the case of regulars, led to signiﬁcantly easier recall than stem-internal vowel changes and non-systematic/non-predictable stem-final change, as is the case of irregulars, lends support to the conclusion that the type of stem allomorphy is what determines the different levels of morphological regularity in Greek. Crucially, this seems to involve a regularity-by-transparency interaction, with predictability playing second fiddle. Our data meet growing psycholinguistic evidence pointing in the same direction, to emphasise the importance of formal redundancy for speakers’ perception of morphological structure. Furthermore, it paves the way to the definition of a performance-oriented notion of inflectional regularity that may ultimately cut across traditional competence-based classifications, which presuppose a hardly tenable subdivision of work between storage and processing.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Unconscious priming experiments show that words can prime other words with related meanings (cat – dog), and these priming effects are assumed to reflect the activation of conceptual knowledge in semantic memory. Alternatively, however, unconscious priming effects could reflect predictive relationships between the words’ forms, since words that are semantically related are also statistically related in language use. Therefore, unconscious “semantic” priming effects could be due to relationships between words’ forms mimicking conceptual relationships, as in Searle’s Chinese Room thought experiment. To distinguish wordform-based and semantics-based accounts of priming we conducted an experiment in which temporal words (e.g., earlier, later) were preceded by spatial words that were processed either consciously or unconsciously. Time is typically conceptualized as a spatial continuum extending along either the sagittal (front-back) or the lateral (left-right) axis, but only the sagittal space-time mapping is encoded in language (e.g. the future is ahead, not to the right). Results showed that temporal words were primed both by sagittal words (back, front) and lateral words (left, right) when primes were perceived consciously, as predicted by both wordform-based and semantics-based accounts. Yet, only sagittal words produced an unconscious priming effect, as predicted by the wordform-based account. Unconscious word processing appears to be limited to relationships between words’ forms, and consciousness may be needed to activate words’ meanings.","What role does consciousness play in word meaning’s construction? As previous literature has pointed out, lexical items seem to be processed up to the semantic level even when processed out of awareness AUTHOR. Most evidence for this claim comes from masked priming: When two words are sequentially presented, the recognition of the latter is made easier if the two are semantically related (cat-dog), even when the visibility of the former (the prime) is prevented by displaying it very briefly, embedded between visual masks AUTHOR. For instance, participants are likely to classify more quickly the word dog as referring to a living entity when it is preceded by the semantically related word cat, rather than by a semantically unrelated word like apple. As similar effects are attested when the prime word is clearly visible, it has been suggested that lexical items can be processed up to the semantic level irrespective of their visibility. We will refer to this perspective as the semantic-based account of masked priming, as it assumes that words are processed beyond their surface structure and activate conceptual knowledge about their referents. Such knowledge is thought to be stored within the semantic memory, where concepts and concepts’ features are represented in an interconnected network AUTHOR. In such a view, cat would prime dog as both words refer to mammals that have four legs, have a tail, can be pet, and so on; and therefore they are more closely related to each other than to apple. However, there is an aspect of semantic similarity that has been largely overlooked in the priming-related literature, that words with similar meaning tend to have a similar contextual distribution. As corpus-based studies have pointed out, words referring to entities with similar perceptual and conceptual attributes tend be used together (e.g., dog and cat are more likely to co-occur in the same sentence than dog and apple), and to be used in similar contexts (e.g., both cat and dog tend to appear when speaking about pets, whether or not they co-occur within a given utterance; AUTHOR). Based on this fact, unconscious priming may be alternatively explained through predictive relationships between words’ forms established in language use. According to the wordform-based account, cat would prime dog simply because the two words share a similar contextual distribution. No conceptual representation is involved, as the locus of the unconscious semantic priming would be the lexical system, not semantic memory (AUTHOR). This latter interpretation of unconscious word processing somehow resembles the Chinese Room thought experiment developed by the philosopher John Searle, where an English-speaking man is closed in a room receiving message written in Chinese characters AUTHOR. Due to a set of norms that determine the relationships between those characters (if you see X followed by Y, than reply Z), he is able to provide answers that would look perfectly appropriate to a native speaker. From the outside, it would appear that the man has a good understanding of the language, while instead he is acting on the basis of associations between word forms. Indeed, if he received a message saying that the room is about to explode, he would reply appropriately; but would not leave the room. For the semantic-based and wordform-based accounts of masked priming to be distinguished, it is necessary to find concepts that are related in the semantic system, but not in the lexical system. This is the case for the metaphorical relationship linking time to space. The two domains are strictly intertwined in the human mind, in such a way that space is often used to think about time AUTHOR. Time conceptualization involves both the sagittal and the lateral axis AUTHOR. For example, participants are faster in responding to past-related words by providing a leftward response, and to future-related words by providing a rightward response, relative to the opposite pattern. The same holds for the sagittal arrangement, with backward response associated with past-related words and forward response associated with future-related words. Moreover, neurological evidence shows that patients with hemispatial neglect have also impairments in temporal judgments (i.e. if they neglect the left side on space, they also show worst memory for past-related events; AUTHOR). Finally, people have been found to use hand gestures along both the lateral and the sagittal line when speaking about time AUTHOR. Critically, while the sagittal mapping is linguistically encoded in sentences such as “a bright future in front of you”, the lateral one is not. The existence of these two mental timelines, and the fact that only one of them is linguistically expressed, offers the ideal test-bed for contrasting the semantic-based and wordform-based accounts of unconscious word processing. The latter predicts that space–time priming would only emerge along the linguistically encoded sagittal axis when primes are kept outside of awareness; while the former would predict priming to emerge along both axes, both supra- and subliminally. ÙWe tested these predictions in a priming study with spatial words related to the lateral (left-right) and the sagittal (ahead-behind) axis as primes, and temporal words referring to either the past (yesterday) or the future (tomorrow) as target stimuli. In the first experiment, primes were clearly visible In the second experiment, prime visibility was prevented by means of a masking procedure.","In this study we looked at the nature of word processing with and without awareness. Using the relationships between space and time, we were able to disentangle the wordform-based from the semantic-based account of masked priming. When words were clearly visible, we found priming effect on both axes, which reflects the sagittal, linguistically encoded, timeline, as well as the lateral mapping, which relies only on conceptual knowledge. Conversely, subliminal priming was obtained only with the sagittal words, matching the predictions of the wordform-based account. Therefore, our data suggests that when people read words unconsciously, activation spreads only between predictively related wordforms. 
Unconscious priming between semantically related words may mimic semantic priming, much in the same way as the man inside Searle’s Chinese Room mimics knowledge of Chinese, on the basis of “meaningless” wordform-wordform relationships. Unconscious word processing appears to be limited to relationships between words’ forms, and consciousness may be needed to activate words’ meanings.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The annotation has shown that the distribution of Narrative Containers is sensitive to the text genre and may be used to facilitate the creation of informative timelines.","Research in Temporal Processing has seen an increasing interest thanks to the availability of annotation schemes and corpora in multiple languages AUTHOR, and the organization of evaluation campaigns (TempEval AUTHOR, Clinical TempEval AUTHOR, Cross-Document TimeLine AUTHOR, Temporal QA AUTHOR), and EVENTI AUTHOR). This has established best practices, common evaluation frameworks, international standards (e.g. ISO-TimeML AUTHOR), and approaches to solve such a complex task. However, the expression of time in text/discourse is by no means obvious and the automatic extraction of timelines is not a solved task yet. One of the limits of current annotation frameworks and corpora relies mainly in the sparseness of the available temporal relations and in the fine-grained values used to classify the temporal links. For instance, in the TempEval-3 corpus the ratio between temporal relations and event plus temporal expressions is 0.8 AUTHOR for 13 temporal values. In the EVENTI corpus, the ratio is even smaller, only 0.19 for 13 temporal values.~.} Furthermore, in some cases annotation guidelines are not informative enough concerning what types of temporal links to annotate, or they force the annotation of temporal relations between pairs of events when they should not be annotated. Attempts to overcome these limits have focused on three main strategies: i.) annotating particular sets of temporal relations AUTHOR; ii.) elaborating detailed annotation guidelines for each kind of temporal relations (event-temporal expression pairs, event-event pairs, and temporal expression-temporal expressions pairs); and iii.) developing densely connected temporal graphs, where all valid relations among the temporal entities (events and temporal expressions) are marked up, including inferred relations based on transitive properties of the temporal relations (e.g. if event A is BEFORE event B and event B IS\_INCLUDED in event C, then event A is BEFORE event C) AUTHOR. We consider these solution as partial as they are not able to address the issue of identifying and extracting informative timelines, i.e. a set of maximally informative temporal links where relevant events in a text/discourse are correctly anchored to time, and then chronologically ordered. This paper reports on the first annotation effort to enrich existing resources for Temporal Processing in Italian by adopting a document-level approach rather than a sentence-level one. Following the proposal of Narrative Containers (NCs) AUTHOR, as embedding intervals where events occur, we developed an annotation scheme for their identification on the EVENTI corpus AUTHOR~}, as a strategy to increase the informativeness of the existing annotations and, possibly, improve systems's temporal awareness. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: the EVENTI corpus will be shortly introduced in Section~sec:eventi, with a particular emphasis on the available temporal relations. Section~sec:nc will present the notion of Narrative Container and the proposed annotation scheme. In Section~sec:itatbNc the results of a pilot annotation on the EVENTI dataset will be reported. Finally, conclusion, future work, and a pointer to the annotated data and guidelines will be reported in Section~sec:conclusion.","This paper reports on a first proposal of an annotation scheme and accompanying annotated data for NCs in Italian news articles. The NC annotation is an additional layer on top of already available data for Temporal Processing in Italian. It addresses pending issues (e.g. the annotation of the temporal relations between event and the Document Creation Time) and increases the informativeness of the document timelines. Overall, we observed that there is a preference for NC to be realized by timexes in a limited time span. However, NCs may also be realised by events. In this case, nouns and verbs have a similar distribution with a preference for events which have a central role in the news or facilitate the clustering of the information (e.g. reporting events). Such a behaviour is different with respect to clinical narratives where nominal events are more frequently selected as NC AUTHOR. This suggests that different text genres present different ways of organizing events on a timeline. The introduction of the factuality parameter to select the anchoring events is a strategy to clean timelines and to move Temporal Processing from a single document to a cross-document task. Future work will aim at assessing the reliability of the proposed scheme via an inter-annotator agreement study and at completing the annotation of the entire EVENTI corpus.

The contribution aims to demonstrate how the existing tool has improved the usefulness of lexicographical portals and how its effectiveness can be further increased by transforming the portal into a collaborative resource.","This paper sketches out the current features and an upcoming new application of a rating system designed to assess online specialized dictionaries. The system evaluative parameters are managed through a relational database accessible for free online at the Web Linguistic Resources (WLR) site. These parameters are used to identify the best available dictionaries to satisfy different types of information needs experienced by the Internet surfers, while the assessment procedure has been designed to be flexible and can be readapted to estimate the supportive value of other resources as well, like grammars or corpora. On the other side, once the score assignment for each dictionary feature has been decided, grades are given automatically by the database. The assessment procedure is straight and strictly operationalized AUTHOR, and it can be used as a guided process to collect data provided by the users themselves. The system is in fact going to be updated and transformed in a collaborative AUTHOR dictionary portal, collecting forms that have been filled in by the Web surfers themselves.","The WLR database has been conceived as a flexible tool that allows its administrators to add or change labels in the three component parts that make up the repository system, which are called ‘categories’, ‘features’ and ‘rating system’. The first component, or ‘category’, lists the types of inventoried linguistic resources: only dictionaries have been assessed so far, but other supportive instruments to solve linguistic issues could be added to the database, like corpora or grammars. To each category the administrator assigns different descriptive features, which is the second component of the rating system, and can be both binary or multivalve. The ‘dictionary’ category has 58 feature (see Caruso, 2014 for a complete list), some of them can only be present or not, thus are binary, like Cultural Notes, others are multivalue and thus need further specifications, like the Kind of Dictionary, which must be set choosing among different choices: Monolingual dictionary, Monolingual word list, Multilingual dictionary, Multilingual word list, Plurilingual dictionary. Lastly, grades are assigned to each of these values according to the methodology described above. The administrator can decide to set different evaluative parameters for each category taken into account: for example, if grammars were added to the repository, the language proficiency level could be a suitable evaluation parameters for it. Once however that the grades distribution has been decided, the database assigns points automatically and independently from any actions performed by the compiler of the evaluation forms, who can set only the values of the different features. Likewise, if the score assignment is changed, the inventoried dictionaries will immediately change their evaluations. The automatization of grades assignment guarantees no errors in the final score computation, however, the selection of values that describe the dictionary features are of crucial relevance for the accuracy of the evaluation. Under this respect, the inventoried resources must be analysed carefully, because most of the times specialized online dictionaries lack strict lexicographical organization and display different data types unsystematically: for example, basic information on the word form might be given exclusively in some of the entries of one dictionary, independently of any significant paradigmatic variation of the language considered. For similar cases, the compiler must set the ‘sometimes’ value in the corresponding feature of the evaluation form, and the record of the data that are sporadically given by the dictionary will make the evaluation procedure more reliable.
Actually, the current development of the project is improving the existing database components with an additional part that keeps track of where unsystematic data, like those mentioned above, are present in the dictionary. This addition will make the assessment procedure extremely reliable, since the less evident features can be registered, making the evaluation accuracy easily verifiable. With this new database component, the evaluation forms will be fillable by anyone and the WLR database will become a collaborative portal. This, hopefully, will make the number of the inventoried resources increase, and it will offer other additional developments. While compiling the forms, in fact, users could also contribute to verify the quality of the data provided, signalling for each dictionary feature if any wrong information is given. For each inconsistency the user should indicate one alternative data and the source of information from which this was driven. On the other hand, the database will offer warning signals that indicate the presence of problematic data within one dictionary.",5,Latin Resources

On the %other hand, the same systems have struggled with questions that %require deeper reasoning. In particular, ""number questions' have been %associated with low performance, and only been studied %surfacely. In this paper, we focus on linguistic questions over images which may be answered with a quantier (e.g. How many dogs are black? Some/most/all of them, etc.). We show that in order to learn to quantity, a multimodal model has to obtain a genuine understanding of linguistic and visual inputs and of their interaction. We proposed a model that extracts a fuzzy representation of the set of the requested objects (e.g. dogs) and of the requested property in relation to that set (e.g. black with respect to dogs), outputting the appropriate quantier for that relationship. %this challenging task.","Computational linguistics and artificial vision systems are going through a particularly favourable time, well represented by the development of multimodal models capable of carrying out tasks that seemed out of reach until a few years ago, and that are now integrated in many applications intended for use by users. The task of 'Visual Question Answering' (VQA), aimed at answering questions from visual inputs, and the automatic generation of captions ('caption generation') are only some of the tasks in which most is witnessed a rapid and unstoppable improvement. In addition to direct applications in the real world, where visual content plays a crucial role, the performance of these language and vision models is also an indicator of the extent to which they capture meaning, providing us with important theoretical insights. Recent improvements in the field of VQA applications are mainly due to the new generation of artificial deep learning networks ('deep learning neural networks'), along with the growing availability of large image datasets. These models have shown that even very simple neural networks (RN) can capture complex interactions between the properties of a dataset, often surpassing in performance models much more complex. For example, AUTHOR has recently shown that a simple bag-of-words model (BoW) can achieve cutting-edge performance in one of the most important VQA AUTHOR datasets. The authors of the study, however, object that the performance of the model is to be attributed more to the excellent ability of the network to store correlations than to a real capacity of reasoning and understanding, and conclude by supporting the need to move to the second objective. Their study also shows how difficult it is to assess whether a model is capable of actually grasping the meaning of images and words. In this work we propose a task that we believe to be useful for the community in order to achieve this objective. In VQA's task, model assessments are based on questions concerning the properties of specific objects, such as location, color, etc., while in the task of generating captions the entire image is taken into account. In both cases, it is obviously possible to learn correlations between the words present in the question, the words present in the answer and the image itself (or parts of it). Presented to an RN model along with the question What is eating?, for example, the image of a person who eats an active cake is definitely the association between the verb eat and properties (both linguistic and visual) connected to the food, producing the correct answer. In order to test a model beyond this simple mechanism, it emerges the need to propose a task in which a particular association between demand and image does not always give the same answer as a result. Questions concerning the ""number' have been studied only marginally in literature, and the performance of VQA systems on these questions has been shown to be quite poor AUTHOR. In addition, the previous works focused almost exclusively on the modelling of exact cardinals, thus analyzing only partially the phenomenon of quantification. In this article we investigate a new type of question that requires a certain degree of understanding of the generalized quantifyors (few, most, all, etc.). The reason why we are interested in these questions is that, in order to answer you, it is not enough to identify the area of an image related to the question. The question In what proportion are dogs black?, for example, requires something more than identifying the dog and black properties in the image: the net must be able to reflect on the relationship between these properties, and to generate one of the quantifyors, which are potentially similar to each other. The ability to identify the members of a set and their shared properties requires a certain degree of deeper reasoning which, we argue, cannot be obtained by a simple storage mechanism. In the following section, we consider the task of VQA as a problem of ""fill in the blank' (fill an empty space with the correct word), and ask the question In what proportion are dogs black? in the following form: \underline{\hspace{5mm} dogs are black}. The possible answers are selected within a set of linguistic quantifiers, i.e. no, few, some, most and all. To assign the correct quantifier, the model must be able to focus on the relevant objects (the quantifier shrink) and to quantify the objects that, within this restricted domain, possess the required property (the quantifier range). We show that a simple BoW model is not enough to perform this task effectively, and we propose an alternative and linguistically motivated RN model, the performance of which is superior to the AUTHOR model.","The RNQ neural network model achieves 38.9% accuracy compared to 30.8% of the iBOWIMG model. The RNQ model is very good with ""no"" and ""all"" and is quite good with ""few"" and ""most."" But its accuracy decreases by ""some"" (18.16%), adversely affecting the overall result. A different analysis instead emerges from the results of the other model, which is quite good in predicting ""no"" and ""all,"" but it is very bad in other cases. For it, ""few"", ""most"" and ""some"" are equally difficult to learn. Its errors in particular in learning ""few"" and ""most"" (see Table 1). These quantifiers require a more precise understanding of the proportions between name and property than ""no"" and ""all"" require. We think, therefore, that this demonstrates the limitations of a model that does not learn to abstract and elaborate proportions. The RNQ model makes understandable mistakes, confusing, for example, ""few"" with ""no"" but not with ""some"", ""most"" and ""all."" This shows that this model has learned to quantify and not simply keep track of correlations in the dataset. On the contrary, the other model confuses ""few"" with ""no"" and ""all"" in equal number. In general, the RNQ model appears to be rather immune to possible effects related to the frequency with which each of the 24 properties is required in the dataset. One might think that very frequent combinations are better learned than infrequent combinations, but this is only true for a few cases, on which stand out ""red"" and ""rectangular."" In most cases, the model behaves in a similar way, in terms of right/wrong responses, in the face of little or very frequent combinations. In the case of some colors (black, blue and violet), we notice a higher accuracy for infrequent combinations than in very frequent cases (see Figure 1). We can say that the performance of the RNQ model does not depend on the frequency effects of the combinations present in the dataset. Again, therefore, it is not a question of learning correlations present in the dataset, but to carry out the task of quantification a deeper understanding of the visual scenario and the demand is necessary.",1,Language Models

Often, the information provided in the comment of a method and in its corresponding implementation may be not coherent with each other (i.e., the comment does not properly describe the implementation). Several could be the motivations for this issue (e.g., comment and source code do not evolve coherently). In this paper, we present the results of a manual assessment on the coherence between comments and implementations of $3,636$ methods, gathered from $4$ Java open-source software. The results of this assessment has been collected in a dataset that we made publicly available on the web. We also sketch here the protocol to create this dataset.","Natural language is used in different ways in the development process of a software system and therefore techniques of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) are more and more frequently integrated into software development and maintenance tools. Many automated or semi-automated techniques have been proposed to aid developers in the comprehension and in the evolution of existing systems, e.g., AUTHOR. Natural language information is provided in source code comments and in the name of identifiers. In the former case, standard natural language is usually adopted, although quite technical. Comments are written in English, even when developers have different mother-tongues. On the other hand, identifiers are typically constructed by composing multiple terms and abbreviations. Therefore, more sophisticated techniques are necessary to extract the lexical information contained in each identifier AUTHOR. Most of these techniques assume that the same words are used whenever referring to a particular concept AUTHOR. In many cases, this represents an oversimplification: methods are often modified without updating the corresponding comments AUTHOR. In these cases, comments might convey information unrelated or inconsistent with the corresponding implementation. Nevertheless, comments are extremely important because they are expected to convey the main intent behind design decisions, along with some implementation details (e.g., types of parameters and of returned values). Therefore, more sophisticated models are necessary to determine if there is coherence between the lexicon provided in comments and in its corresponding source code. Hence, there exists coherence between a lead comment of a method and its source code (also simply coherence, from here on) if that comment describes the intent of the method and its actual implementation. In this work, we focus on the lead comment of methods. This kind of comments precedes the definition of a given method and is supposed to provide its documentation and details about the implementation. We discuss here a dataset we made publicly available on the web. It contains annotations about the coherence of 3,636 methods collected from 4 implementations of 3 open source projects written in Java. The defined protocol used for its creation is also sketched, to give researchers the opportunity to possibly extend it. Further details on this protocol can be found in AUTHOR. For the assessment of the quality of the annotation with special focus on computational linguistics applications, a few indexes have been considered AUTHOR, among which the kappa index AUTHOR is the most widely adopted because of its favorable characteristics. The inter-annotator agreement has therefore been assessed by this parameter. We expect that making freely available this dataset could give impulse to the research for approaches to assess the coherence between the implementation of a method and its lead comment (simply coherence, from here on). In fact, although no approach has been yet proposed in this regard, they could be of great help for software maintenance and evolution activities. The paper is structured as follows. In Section approach, we discuss the methodology used to create our dataset. A description of the main characteristics of the dataset is given in Section~sec:dataset, while in Section~sec:results the annotation is assessed.

Less frequent is the syntactic parsing of learning varieties. This contribution proposes a first attempt at parsing applied to a subcorpus of VALICO, in an attempt to identify key elements that could serve to chart a route for syntactic labelling of Italian corpora as a foreign/second language (LS).","It is now customary to read and write down the body of learners for Parts of Speech (PoS) and there are many examples of labeling errors; instead, the experiences of parsing and syntactic annotations of corporate learner are not as widespread. The reasons are many, but certainly due to the extreme unpredictability and markedness that characterizes the interlanguage of the learners. Despite the complexity of the operation, which necessarily requires a good dose of manual intervention, the parsing of a learner corpus can have positive repercussions in more than one area: in addition to the contribution for contexts that deal with computational linguistics in a precipio way, it becomes extremely useful for research on acquisition and learning, because it allows to more easily detect errors, deviations from the norm and distribution of syntactic categories and structures otherwise difficult to emerge by questioning a corpus labeled only for parts of the speech. Applying parsing processes to learning varieties is certainly not a novelty: the syntactic treatment of learner interlinguals has long been the focus of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and Intelligent Language Tutoring Systems (ILTS) systems (Vandeventer Faltin, 2003; Heift & Nicholson, 2001; Amaral & Meurers, 2011). In these cases the violation of the syntactic rules, such as the non-agreement between the subject and the verb, becomes a spy of the presence of an error to be reported to those who produce the text. Menzel & Schröder (1999) uses parameters that describe dependencies within the languages of learners, to which weighed constraints and robust parsing procedures are applied to define the deviation from the norm. The distance from canonical and unmarked structures must, however, be defined from a standard to which the learning varieties are traced. This is why the parser of the learner corpus must be applied in advance to a corpus of natives, possibly comparable to that of the learners. A common practice is then to bring wrong occurrences back to a target form, a manual procedure usually used by those corporate learners noted also for errors. Some attempts have been made so far mainly for German (Nivre et al., 2007, Lüdeling 2008, Ott & Zai 2010), but the terrain still seems unexplored with regard to the Italian landscape. This contribution is proposed as a first attempt to apply parsing procedures to a corpus of learners of Italian as a foreign language, to define its criticalities and benefits both from the computational point of view and from the study of learning varieties. In particular, some data extracted from the corpus VALICO1 will be taken into account, selected from the subbody defined according to the L1 of the learners. For this pilot study it was chosen to compare the results of the treatment of texts of Hispanophone and Germanophone learners, with the aim of identifying syntactic peculiarities of the interlingues of learners coming from typologically different languages: typically romance and therefore close to the Italian Lupin, representative of the Germanic area the other. 12 texts (four for each of the first three years of Italian study) were randomly extracted from the Germanophone subcorpus and 12 texts derived from the Hispanophone subcorpus, according to the same selection criteria. A total of 126 sentences were processed for the German group, for the Spanish group 78. The ultimate aim is to determine which deviations from the standard of either group are not correctly labelled, so as to trace a path that can lead to the definition of labelling rules to train the parser and improve its performance on this language variety.
VINCA, the corpus of natives paired with VALICO, will serve as a body of reference for the dependent parser developed among the tools of Turin University Linguistic Environment (TULE).","The experience gained in this first phase of the research and implementation of parsing on the corpus of learners VALICO has allowed to highlight the advantages and criticalities of the tools used. From the computational point of view, it has emerged that it is necessary to integrate resources and define the training protocols of the parser oriented to the treatment of that particular variety of language which is the interlingua of learners. A qualitative evaluation showed that errors caused by the omission of key syntactical elements for the definition of dependencies lead to errors in the same labeling, as happens on the occasion of the overexpansion of some forms to functions that they do not have, or still of the negative synergy between morphologically complex forms and spelling errors; other errors instead are treated in a problematic way. 
The difficulties in managing prepositional syntagms and widespread linguistic transfer phenomena, especially at the level of the verbal system, reveal how the identification of trends and the definition of some indications on the treatment of such constructions could greatly increase the accuracy of automatic labelling. Compared to the definition of an architecture that integrates syntactical parsing at PoS tagging, it is necessary to draw up a clear proposal for the definition of labelling rules; moreover, it remains to be determined whether it is really necessary to align with the choices made for other corporate learners in which a target hypothesis is defined that marks the objective structure of the production of the apprentice and highlights its distance from the version actually reported in the corpus.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

Recently, the \Nystrom methodology for data embedding has been proposed as a viable solution to scalability problems. By mapping data into low-dimensional approximations of kernel spaces, it positively increases scalability through compact linear representations for highly structured data. In this paper, we show that \Nystrom methodology can be effectively used to apply a kernel-based method in the cQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results by reducing the computational cost of orders of magnitude.","Kernel methods AUTHOR have been employed in several Machine Learning algorithms AUTHOR achieving state-of-the-art performances in many classification tasks. Recently, the kernel based approach presented in AUTHOR has been applied in the community Question Answering (cQA) challenge at SemEval 2016 AUTHOR obtaining state-of-the-art results. Unfortunately, when large data volumes are involved, time and space complexity required in learning and classification may prevent the adoption of expressive but complex kernel functions, such as Sequence AUTHOR or Tree kernels AUTHOR. In particular, the classification cost required by a kernel-based model crucially depends on its number of support vectors: classifying a new instance requires a kernel computation against all support vectors. This scalability issue is evident in many NLP and IR applications, such as in re-ranking answers in question answering AUTHOR, where the number of support vectors is typically very large. Some approaches have been defined to bound the complexity of kernel-based methods, such as AUTHOR, but they are still specific to kernel formulations and learning algorithms. In AUTHOR it has been shown that a viable and more general solution to the above scalability issues is the \Nystrom methodology, a dimensionality reduction technique that has been applied also in kernel-based methods since AUTHOR. This methodology has been designed to approximate the Gram Matrix derivable by a kernel function, enabling the projections of examples into low-dimensional spaces. The \Nystrom projection function is generated by using some examples called landmarks, whose number directly impacts on the embeddings quality; dually, costs of projecting a new example in the embedding space rise linearly with the number of landmarks, that is usually of orders of magnitude lower with respect of the number of possible support vectors that can be derived from a learning process. Once each example is projected in the dense low-dimensional space, the application of efficient linear learning methods is enabled, such as AUTHOR, preserving at the same time the expressiveness and effectiveness of kernel methods. This approach is highly applicable to different input data as well as to different kernels or learning algorithms, as discussed in AUTHOR. In this paper we show that the \Nystrom method can be effectively used in the cQA task, by adopting the same kernel functions proposed in AUTHOR and obtaining the same results w.r.t. the metrics adopted in the SemEval task, by reducing the computational cost of orders of magnitude. In Section Nystrom, we demonstrate the viability of the \Nystrom method to reduce the computational costs of kernel machines. Experimental results (obtained by adopting efficient SVM learning over the cQA task) are discussed in Section Exp. Finally, Section sec:relwork describes related work, while in Section sec:concl conclusions are derived.","This paper discussed the application of \Nystrom method for a significant reduction of computational costs in kernel-based classifications in the cQA task. By projecting examples into low-dimensional embeddings, \Nystrom enables the adoption of efficient linear classifier, and drastically reduces the overall computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to a cost reduction higher than 90\%, with a negligible performance drop. Future research will be devoted to the definition of a principled strategy to estimate the optimal number of layers, as well as the size of embeddings at each layer.",22,Distributional Semantics

Similarity-based observations are matched to the actual year when a figurative meaning was documented in a reference dictionary and through manual inspection of corpus occurrences.","It is widely acknowledged that metaphors are pervasive in language use, and that their detection and interpretation are crucial to language processing AUTHOR. One tricky aspect related to metaphors is their dynamic nature: new metaphors are created all the time. For example, in recent years the Italian term ``talebano'' (`Taliban'), previously only used to refer to the Islamic fundamentalist political movement founded in the Nineties in Afghanistan (Example~exa:talib-lit), has come to define more generally someone who is extreme in his or her positions, for example regarding food, use of medicines, and the like (Example~exa:talib-fig)., see Section~sec:corpus.} \item (lit.) l'operazione [...] ha permesso di arrestare un talebano esperto in esplosivi \itemsep 0pt \item (fig.) [...] senza l'atteso top player, e di un allenatore talebano della tattica \noindent If the metaphorical meaning becomes commonly used, it might get recorded in reference dictionaries, too. Indeed, for the case of ``talebano'' the Italian dictionary Zingarelli AUTHOR has recorded the metaphorical extension (``che (o chi) \`{e} dogmatico, integralista'') in the year 2009, while until then only the literal meaning was included. Most of the computational work on metaphors has focused on their identification and interpretation using a variety of techniques and models, such as clustering AUTHOR, LDA topic modeling AUTHOR, tree kernels AUTHOR, but all from a purely synchronic perspective..} The way metaphors develop across time, instead, and whether the shift of a word's literal meaning to a figurative one can be automatically detected and modelled is as of now a little investigated aspect. As a contribution in this sense, we build on the basic observation that if a metaphorical meaning is acquired by a term at a certain point in time, the context of use of that term will, at least partially, change. In this paper we offer a proof of concept of this assumption, based on a selection of terms. (Dis)similarity of contexts is measured relying on the distributional semantics approach, and thus on the terms' vector representations, and the existence of a metaphoric shift is derived from the Zingarelli dictionary of Italian.","This work was meant as an exploration of the assumption that the emergence of the metaphorical use of a term might be mirrored in changes in cosine similarity of the term to itself across time. Such assumption has been partially confirmed by the comparison to the Zingarelli dictionary, while we found a more robust evidence when inspecting the terms' contexts of use manually. Future work will stem from methodology and observations discussed here. Specifically, we plan to investigate further several aspects of this initial work, including the relation between changes in cosine similarity and frequency of use of a word: to which extent a change of the former relates to an increase of the latter? Mostly though, we plan to run experiments on larger sets of words with the aim to consolidate and then further exploit the mainly qualitative observations reported here towards the development of reliable predictive metrics which can serve to detect the emergence of shifts automatically, in a completely bottom-up fashion.

The first approach is represented by the application of the latent DirichLet Allocation (henceforth LDA), defining the evaluation of this model as baseline of comparison. The second framework employs Word2Vec technique to learn the word vector representations to be later used to topic-model our data. Compared to the previously defined LDA baseline, results show that the use of Word2Vec word embeddings significantly improves topic modelling performance but only when an accurate and task-oriented linguistic pre-processing step is carried out.","Over recent years, the development of political corpora AUTHOR has represented one of the major trends in the fields of corpus and computational linguistics. Being carriers of specific content features, these textual resources have met the interest of researchers and practitioners in the study of topic detection. Unfortunately, not only has this task turned out to be hard and challenging even for human evaluators but it must be borne in mind that manual annotation often comes with a price. Hence, the aid provided by unsupervised machine learning techniques proves to be fundamental in addressing the topic detection issue.\newline Topic models are a family of algorithms that allow to analyse unlabelled large collections of documents in order to discover and identify hidden topic patterns in the form of cluster of words. While LDA AUTHOR has become the most influential topic model AUTHOR, different extensions have been proposed so far: Rosen-Zvi et al. AUTHOR developed an author-topic generative model to include also authorship information; Chang et al. AUTHOR presented a probabilist topic model to infer descriptions of entities from corpora identifying also the relationships between them; Yi Yang et al. AUTHOR proposed a factor graph framework for incorporating prior knowledge into LDA.\newline In the present paper we aim at topic modelling the CompWHoB Corpus AUTHOR, a political corpus collecting the transcripts of the White House Press Briefings. The main characteristic of our dataset is represented by its dialogical structure: since the briefing consists of a question-answer sequence between the US press secretary and the news media, the topic under discussion may change from one answer to the following question, and vice versa. Our purpose was to address this main feature of the CompWHoB Corpus associating at each answer/question only one topic. In order to reach our goal, we propose an evaluative comparison of two different frameworks: in the first one, we employed the LDA approach by extracting from each answer/question document only the topic with the highest probability; in the second framework, we applied the word embeddings generated from the Word2Vec model AUTHOR to our data in order to test how dense high-quality vectors represent our data, finally comparing this approach with the previously defined LDA baseline. The evaluation was performed using a set of gold-standard annotations developed by human experts in political science and linguistics. In Section 2 we present the dataset used in this work. In Section 3, the linguistic pre-processing is detailed. Section 4 shows the methodology employed to topic-model our data. In Section 5 we present the results of our work.","In this contribution we have presented a comparative evaluation of two unsupervised learning approaches to topic modelling. Two experiments were carried out: in the first one, we applied a classical LDA model to our dataset; in the second one, we trained our model using Word2Vec so as to generate the word embeddings for topic-modelling our test set. After clustering the output of the two approaches, we evaluated them using the external criterion of purity. Results show that the use of word embeddings outperforms the LDA approach but only if a linguistic task-oriented pre-processing stage is carried out. As at the moment no comprehensive explanation can be provided, we can only suggest that the main reason for these results may lie in the fluctuating length of each document in our dataset. In fact, we hypothesise that the use of word embeddings may prove to be the boosting factor of Word2Vec topic model since encoding information about the close context of the target term. As part of future work, we aim to further investigate this aspect and design a topic model framework that could take into account the main structural and linguistic features of the CompWHoB Corpus.

Final results and interesting observations concerning the annotation task are discussed.","The case of language borrowing was investigated in depth by AUTHOR, who argues that a linguistic loan is an interference phenomenon, connected with contact and mutual influence of different languages. According to his study, the motivations behind the origin of a loan lie in the individual act of a speaker or of a group of speakers. The need to resort to a foreign alternative derives from the prestige held by the latter against an equivalent word in the mother tongue of the speaker (or from the absence all together of an alternative, as in our work: “Se mi vede, Miki mi banna (<to ban)” vs. *“Se mi vede Miki mi bandisce”). Facts show that language borrowing is particularly common among specialized languages, more so if they are linked to technical contexts. This is extremely visible within the computer context. The main focus of this paper is the informal variety of Italian as used by communities of online video-gamers, computer experts and amateurs, forum users, etc.; a specialized language linked to technical context populated with partially integrated and un-acclimatised English verb loans. These kinds of (mostly) lexical influences are so recent that their structure is hardly stable, and the process of integration – graphical, morphological, phonetic, and lexical – in the language is still in progress. For instance, they tend to retain the phonetic property of the original word, especially of the lexical root (to spawn > spawnare /spo’nare/). The new word serves as an alternative – usually a hyponym – of an already existing term1. As for the concept of loan acclimatisation, the literature states that it involves the role of the new term in the target language. Therefore, Gusmani speaks of acclimatisation only with regard to the lexicon and its connection with speakers’ usage: the more they familiarise with the loan, the more the latter gets acclimatised. It follows that – for very recent, scarcely integrated loans – the majority of speakers, as well as linguistic authorities, do not perceive the influence of English as an enrichment of the lexical heritage but mostly as a nuisance. If it is true that a number of reports describe the interference of English over Italian as an impoverishment, some attempts have also been made to study the less acclimatized loans themselves. It is thus of interest to examine why this kind of loan infiltrates the Italian language, how the speakers cope with the new word and what is the semantics of the loan in the target language. The aim of the present paper is to give a detailed account of how the meaning of a verb loan changes (and if it changes) in the target language and to offer a reliable source of lexical information in the form of an electronic lexicon built for the occasion. Section 2 details the method used to collect suitable data; section 3 illustrates the structure and functions of the lexicon; section 4 provides the results of our analysis as well as the annotation task performed with our data; section 5 discusses our findings and section 6 finally provides a conclusion.","The peculiarities of each group of annotators lead to a thought-provoking analysis of the tagsets and the semantic notions themselves. The analysis of the semantic behaviour of the loans unveils deeper questions on the speaker’s strategy: if it is easier to reuse a loan whose meaning already exists, why are there also loans with new or diversified meaning? Furthermore it came to our attention that yes, many loans are linked to the informatics/technical context (rippare, sloggare, etc.) but others can be considered as hyponyms of already existing Italian verbs, whose meaning is rather general (cheattare for barare, whinare for lamentarsi, etc.). It is possible to already discern synonymic and antonymic relations between the loans themselves: craftare, farmare 2, spawnare 1 or sbuggare-buggare. Finally, the most productive verb classes in our corpus are the verbs of change of state, the creation verbs and the verbs of killing.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

LICO includes about 170 discourse connectives used in Italian, together with their orthographical variants, part of speech(es), semantic relation(s) (according to the Penn Discourse Treebank relation catalogue), and a number of usage examples.","Discourse connectives are explicit lexical markers that are used to express functional relations between parts of the discourse. As an example, the italian word ``quando'' in the sentence ``Quando si preme sul bottone, la porta si apre da sola'' (When you press the button, the door opens by itself) expresses a conditional relation between two parts of the sentence (from now on, arguments). Work on discourse connectives in Computational Linguistics was initially part of Rhetorical Structure Theory AUTHOR, where the focus is on discourse relations, which are at the basis of the notion of textual coherence. In Computational Linguistics, being able to identify connectives is a central task in ``shallow discourse parsing'', which has become very popular in recent years (e.g., AUTHOR) and constituted the shared task of the CONLL conference in 2015 and 2016. Downstream applications that can benefit from shallow discourse structure are, inter alia, sentiment analysis (e.g., AUTHOR and argumentation mining (e.g., AUTHOR). Our work on connectives is mainly motivated by the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, still there is no high coverage resource of discourse connectives available for Italian. LICO, the Lexicon for Italian COnnectives, aims at filling this gap, providing a repository of Italian connectives aligned with recent developments in discourse relations (i.e. the last version (3.0) of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)). In addition, the LICO lexicon takes advantage from DimLex, a similar repository for German AUTHOR; in fact DimLex served as the main inspiration for creating LICO (see section building). DimLex is an XML-encoded resource that can be used for NLP; the public version provides information on orthographical variants, syntactic behavior, semantic relations (in terms of PDTB), and usage examples. It is used for automatic discourse parsing, and also for semi-automatic text annotation using the ConAno tool AUTHOR.} Another relevant resource for connectives is LEXCONN, for French, AUTHOR, which contains about 300 connectives with their syntactic category and coherence relations from Segmented Discourse Representation Theory AUTHOR(and to some extent Rhetorical Structure Theory AUTHOR). LICO is freely distributed under a CC-BY licence.","In this paper we have presented LICO, a new resource for the Italian language describing lexical properties of discourse connectives. While LICO fills a gap with respect to similar resources existing for other languages, it is still under construction under several aspects. Our short term plans include the completion of the lexical entries with corpus derived examples and the observation of the connectives in Italian corpora, in order to acquire more information about the semantic relations that each connective can indicate and thus extend the annotation of the semantic relations in LICO. \\ We acknowledge Denise Pangrazzi for her contribution to identify the Italian equivalents of the German connectives.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Spalding",0,0,"Italy, Canada","Pisa, Edmonton","Elevation in typing latency for the initial letter of the second constituent of an English compound, relative to the latency for the final letter of the first constituent of the same compound, provides evidence that implementation of a motor plan for written compound production involves smaller constituents, in both semantically transparent and semantically opaque compounds. We investigate here the implications of this evidence for algorithmic models of lexical organisation, to show that effects of differential perception of the internal structure of compounds and pseudo-compounds can also be simulated as peripheral stages of lexical access by a self-organising connectionist architecture, even in the absence of morpho-semantic information. This complementary evidence supports a maximization-of-opportunity approach to lexical modelling, accounting for the integration of effects of pre-lexical and lexical access.","A key question concerning the representation and processing of compound words has focused on whether (and, if so, how) morphological structure plays a role. The bulk of the research on this issue has come from recognition or comprehension tasks such as lexical decision or reading. However, written production provides a useful counterpart and allows researchers to examine whether morphemes are used even after a word has been accessed. One advantage of a typing task (in which the time to type each letter of a word is recorded) is that researchers can examine differences in processing difficulty at various points in the word. Previous research found an elevation in typing latency for the initial letter of the second constituent relative to the latency for the final letter of the first constituent for English AUTHOR and German compounds AUTHOR. This elevation in typing latency at the morpheme boundary suggests that the system plans the output morpheme by morpheme, rather than as a whole unit, and that morphological programming is not complete when the motor system begins the output of the word AUTHOR. AUTHOR examined the role of morphemic structure and semantic transparency on typing latency. The stimuli consisted in 200 compounds, 50 pseudo-compounds, and 250 monomorphemic words matched pairwise with the compounds and pseudo-compounds in the number of syllables and letters. The pseudo-compounds contain two words that do not function as morphemes (e.g., carpet contains car and pet). The compounds varied in whether the first and second constituent were semantically transparent. The items were displayed individually using a progressive demasking procedure and participants typed the word as the computer recorded the time required to type each letter. The time to initiate the first letter was equivalent for monomorphemic and compound words. Typing times got faster across the word for both word types, but the rate of change was faster for monomorphemic words than for compound words. This difference was not observed when comparing monomorphemic words and pseudo-compounds. For compounds, the rate of speed-up was slower when the first constituent was transparent than when it was opaque, but was unaffected by the transparency of the second constituent. The elevation in typing latency at the morpheme boundary was larger when the first constituent was transparent than when it was opaque, but was unaffected by the transparency of the second constituent. This difference is due to the final letter of the first constituent when the first constituent requiring less time to type when it was transparent than when it was opaque. The data for the pseudo-compounds indicated that embedded morphemes influence production, even when they do not function as morphemes. Typing latency increased one letter prior to the end of the first constituent of a pseudo-compound and remained elevated through the boundary (e.g., both r and c in scarcity were elevated relative to the a).","Trained on both compounds and pseudo-compounds, TSOMs develop a growing sensitivity to surface distributional properties of input data, turning chains of randomly connected, general-purpose nodes into specialised sub-chains of BMUs that respond to specific letter strings at specific positions. Compounds not only tend to occur, on average, less frequently than their C1/C2 constituents do as independent words (Ji et al. 2011), but they tend to present lower-frequency bigrams at the C1-C2 boundary than do pseudo-compounds. Principles of Hebbian learning allow TSOMs to capitalise on both effects. Entrenchment makes expectations for high-frequency bigrams stronger and expectations for low-frequency bigrams weaker. At the same time, the competition between C1 as an independent word and C1 as the first constituent in a C1-C2 compound biases the map’s expectation towards the most frequent event (C1 in isolation). Compound families, i.e. sets of compounds sharing C1 (windmill, windshield etc.) or C2 (snowball, basketball etc.), magnify these effects, making the map more sensitive to formal discontinuity at morpheme boundaries. When more C2s can follow the same C1 in complementary distribution, the left-to-right expectation for a particular C2 to occur, given C1, decreases. Likewise, when more C1s competitively select the same C2, the individual contribution of each C1 to the prediction of C2 decreases. We conjecture that more global effects of lexical organisation like these may eventually blur local memory effects based on position-independent bigram frequencies. Our simulations with TSOMs can model the correlation between continuously varying distributional regularities in the input data and peripheral levels of routinized recognition and production patterns. These patterns are in line with Gagné & Spalding’s evidence of (a) the influence of embedded pseudo-morphemes on cascaded models of written word production, and (b) faster anticipation rates for monomorphemic vs. compound words. Further experimental results (not reported here), obtained by including compound families in the training data, confirm slower anticipation rates for true compound constituents, due to the combined effect of word frequency distributions and word compositionality in compound families. The size of a compound family can arguably be a function of the degree of productivity and semantic transparency of its members (Baroni et al. 2007). The influence of the compound family size on anticipation rates can shed light on the influence of levels of semantic transparency on compound processing. Simulation evidence suggests that the bigger the family, the stronger its influence will be. Finally, we also monitored the influence of increasing token frequencies of monomorphemic words in the training data on the map perception of constituent boundaries within compounds. As expected, for constant frequency values of compounds in the training set, the higher the token frequency of monomorphemic words, the higher the pointwise entropy of connections at the C1-C2 boundary. A full account of Gagné & Spalding’s evidence of a graded influence of semantic transparency on compound processing is beyond the reach of the computational architecture presented here. Surface effects of discontinuity in the internal structure of compounds (as opposed to pseudo-compounds) appear to provide a purely formal, pre-lexical scaffolding for truly morpho-semantic effects to emerge at later processing stages. To model these effects, we appear to be in need of a parallel processing architecture able to effectively integrate several representational levels (orthographic, phonological, morphological, and conceptual) and different processing steps within a single distributed system (Smolka et al. 2009). Nonetheless, our simulations show that by letting compounds, pseudo-compounds and (pseudo)constituents compete for the same level of memory resources on a topological map, it is possible to account for apparently contradictory effects of a) graded perception of constituent boundary in both compounds and pseudo-compounds, apparently requiring prelexical decomposition, and b) higher anticipation rates for pseudo-compounds than compounds, supporting full form representations for lexical access.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

A feedback from quantitative methods applied to psycholinguistic models in two studies on Italian.,ENG,3,2,1,"Università di Padova, San Camillo IRCCS",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,"Padua, Venice","We examined two issues concerning Italian Number morphology: the phenomena related to mass and count nouns and to the plural dominance. By taking into account quantitative data from corpora and subjective frequency ratings in three mixed effect models, we found that differences in participants’ performance in two lexical decision tasks could be better captured as differences in frequency rather than in terms of effects of lexical categories.","The role of frequency in lexical retrieval is well known for what concerns psycholinguistic studies AUTHOR: the higher the frequency of a word, the faster its retrieval. Generally, the singular form of a noun is more frequent than the corresponding plural, and thus retrieved faster. However, some nouns (e.g. stelle, ‘stars’) do occur more frequently in the plural than in the singular: the phenomenon is known as plural dominance. Plural dominant nouns are in fact accessed faster in the plural form than in the singular. Since such nouns are not identifiable as a homogeneous group by means of some semantic features, the phenomenon has been explained as a mere effect of the frequency of occurrence of the forms AUTHOR. While the plural dominance seems to be unrelated to grammatical constraints, another phenomenon involving Number morphology seems to be grammatically grounded instead, namely the mass-count issue AUTHOR. Nouns referring to countable entities are called ‘count nouns’ (anello, ‘ring’), nouns referring to uncountable entities are called ‘mass nouns’ (burro, ‘butter’). Some constraints rule the possibility for the two types of nouns to occur in some morphosyntactic contexts, for example count nouns cannot occur in the singular after a quantifier (*molto anello, ‘much ring’), while mass nouns cannot occur with numerals or the indeterminate article (*un burro, ‘a butter’). For what concerns Number morphology, mass nouns should occur only inflected in the singular (but for a deeper discussion, see i.a. AUTHOR. Previous lexical decision tasks have pointed out to some differences in the processing of count nouns with respect to mass nouns, which would require longer response times (RTs) AUTHOR. In the light of these results, it has been proposed that an additional lexical feature has to be computed for mass nouns as compared to count nouns. While psycholinguistic studies on plural dominance have relied on relative frequency of singular and plural forms in the selection of stimuli and in results analysis, even the most recent experimental studies on the mass-count issue have not quantified the actual occurrence of the experimental stimuli in mass context and in count context: nouns have rather been assigned to a mass or to a count category on the basis of the experimenters’ judgments. Quantitative data on syntactic contexts can instead provide a better estimate of the frequency of use of nouns as countable or uncountable: in the present study we relied on the actual occurrence of nouns in the different syntactic contexts in assigning them to the “mass” or to the “count” experimental list. We will describe and put into comparison two lexical decision tasks, concerning the phenomena of mass-count and of plural dominance respectively. We will explore the possibility that the mass-count effects described in psycholinguistic literature could be better explained in terms of frequency of occurrence, as it is recognized by most literature with respect to plural dominance. We hypothesize that the frequency of occurrence of the word form (inflected in the singular or in the plural) will predict the RTs in lexical decision tasks contrasting mass and count nouns, as well as in the ones concerning the plural dominance issue. The frequency of occurrence will be measured by means of two subjective frequency rating studies and in the corpus ItWaC AUTHOR. We will rely on quantitative measures to categorize experimental stimuli. Measures of plural dominance of nouns will be based on the ratio between their occurrence in the plural and in the singular; the mass and count experimental nouns will be categorized considering their distribution with respect to mass and count morphosyntactic contexts.","In this study we applied quantitative methods in the selection of experimental stimuli used in the two lexical decision tasks. In both tasks, results from the three models showed effects of subjective frequency and corpus frequency but not of category in written word recognition. For what concerns the plural dominance issue, this result was in line with previous literature. For what concerns the mass-count issue, our results are unexpected instead. Remind that frequency of occurrence in mass and count contexts was used to avoid biases in categorization of stimuli. Nevertheless, we did not observe differences in RTs between the two so categorized groups of nouns. Thus, we suggest that there is no need to postulate the computation of a lexical feature related to countability or uncountability in nouns. We propose that the fact that a noun is considered “mass” is better described as an epiphenomenon of the distribution of noun with respect of syntactic contexts. However the possibility for a noun to occur in the different syntactic contexts does not predict lexical decision RTs: frequency, as measured in the corpus and by the rating study, is the predictor of the lexical access times with respect to words presented in isolation. In this sense, the mass-count issue is similar to the plural dominance phenomenon: even in that case, there is no need to assume the presence of a feature marking plurality, as the frequency of the inflected form is sufficient to account for the observed effects in lexical decision tasks. The frequency of occurrence of nouns considered as a continuous variable is a better predictor of RTs than a distinction attributed to alleged lexical categories both in the case of phenomena seemingly unrelated to core grammar rules, like the plural dominance, as well as in phenomena that have traditionally been described as grammar based, like the mass-count issue.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The project initially focused on the German-speaking language group. However, all information regarding the project, e.g.~the invitation to participate, the privacy agreement, the project web site, and the questionnaire for socio-demographic data was published in German and Italian.

The linking is based on a machine learning algorithm that exploits the lexical information of the two resources. The algorithm has been firstly trained and tested on a manually annotated dataset and then it was run on all the data, allowing to connect 773 IMAGACT action videos with 517 BabelNet synsets. This linkage aims to enrich BabelNet verbal entries with a visual representations and to connect the IMAGACT ontology to the huge BabelNet semantic network.","Ontologies are widely used to represent language resources on the web, allowing them to be easily accessed and exploited by machines. For this reason, data interconnection between different semantic resources is a crucial task in order to enhance disambiguation and information retrieval capabilities in Artificial Intelligence, as evidenced by the increasing research into mapping and linking techniques among ontologies AUTHOR. Nevertheless, ontology mapping has to face the problem of concept representation mismatch between resources, due to different building criteria and purposes AUTHOR. Instance matching techniques play an important role in this context, allowing to connect entities from heterogeneous data resources which refer to the same real-world object AUTHOR. Aside the general interest for knowledge bases interconnection in a web-based perspective, there is also a growing interest in multimodal resources, which combine textual and visual data. These resources can be exploited by intelligent algorithms integrating vision and natural language processing techinques}. This integrated approach was successfully applied for some challenging tasks involving verbs and their action reference as a video. Regneri et al. \shortcite{TACL502} developed machine learning models for the automatic identification of similarity among actions, by using a corpus of natural language descriptions, derived from the videos of the MPII Cooking Composite Activities dataset, which represents actions involved in basic cooking tasks. Instead, the algorithm developed by Mathe et al. \shortcite{mathe4563042} extracts higher level semantic features in common among a sample set of verbs, using a fine-grained analysis of the represented action concepts, intended as a subsequent stable set of abstract features of the objects involved in the videos. Within this interdisciplinary perspective, a knowledge base which relates verbal lemmas in different languages with video prototypes can help in serveral applications, and be exploited by both humans and machines.","The experiment described in this paper shows that is possible to obtain an extensive linking between IMAGACT and BabelNet through visual entities (see Figure fig for a visual representation of a linking example); this can be advantageous for both the resources. BabelNet can add a clear video representation of the verbal synsets that refer to actions; IMAGACT can import verb translation candidates from many languages by exploiting the BabelNet semantic network; their integration can be exploited as a unified multimedial resource to accomplish complex tasks that combine natural language processing and computer vision.

We investigate the presence of psychopathy through the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI-R). Psychopathy is a personality disorder that is characterized by emotional detection, the lack of empathy and it is often found in the prison population for the brutality of committed crimes. Our study explores possible associations between psychopathy and emotional content present in the narratives. Results show a neutral polarity for both psychopathic and not psychopaths offenders, though it is possible to identify significant emotional characteristics that diverse the narrative transcriptions.","Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by emotional deficits, antisocial lifestyle, lack of guilt and empathy. In psychopaths the affective coloring that usually serves to differentiate emotional events from neutral ones does not exist to the same extent as other individuals AUTHOR. Psychopaths have a relaxed emotional response to the events they experience and to the people they interact with. The characteristic traits of psychopathy are found in some of the offenders detained AUTHOR, precisely because of the peculiarities related to the violence of the acts experienced by these people AUTHOR. In addition, the emotional callosity, characteristic of the disorder, seems to be associated with a minimalized perception of the emotional experience (positive or negative) of the event experienced, relative both to the moment in which it occurred and to the recall of the event itself AUTHOR. The inability to develop and experience the emotional content of stimuli and events can have consequences on memory capacity and therefore on the possibility of processing and recovering emotional information about the event experienced. Empirical evidence AUTHOR claims that psychopathic people suffer from an emotional deficit that can have an impact on their way of perceiving the memory of events. Some clinicians and researchers argue that psychopaths are generally unable to learn the emotional significance of the events; therefore it is assumed that the stories of psychopathic offenders are devoid of emotional details compared to the narratives of the non-psychopathic offenders AUTHOR. Research in these areas needs to be implemented, in fact in recent years the basic research in cognitive psychology has expanded through the adaptation of procedures, variables and the involvement of other scientific domains, including psycholinguistics. These adaptations make it possible to broaden the knowledge of personality characteristics and their influence on behaviour in diverse contexts, such as the prison, in order to make it possible to implement targeted and suitable intervention programs to support people with such disorders. The present study is the result of these integrations of conceptual domains and research, in this case the sentiment analysis applies, a methodology for the automatic elaboration of the text in order to extract subjective information in a psycho-Forense context. 48 offenders, perpetrators of violent crimes, were asked, through a task of free-recall, to narrate the autobiographical memory of the criminal event committed for which they were convicted, such remembrance was transcribed by the investigators simultaneously to the narration.

The results obtained by sentiment analysis were compared with those obtained through the PPI-R test that evaluates the personality traits of the subject through the investigation of those cognitive, emotional and perceptive behaviors and peculiarities that constitute the typical traits of psychopathy. The results obtained through the use of an approach based on the induction of decision trees demonstrate an dependence between the presence of psychopathy and the difference between the maximum positive polarity and the negative polarity identified in the convict's narration. In addition, a correlation has been found between the maximum polarity score and the fearless Dominance factor through the use of statistical tests. The results obtained are encouraging and demonstrate the effectiveness of expanding basic research into cognitive psychology with innovative tools such as sentiment analysis and generally automatic text analysis.

The resource contains a list of the main senses associated to a given term, and it was obtained by applying a simple set of pruning heuristics to the senses provided in the NASARI vectors for the set of $15K$ most frequent English terms. The preliminary experimentation provided encouraging results.","Many NLP tasks involve word sense disambiguation (WSD) and word sense induction (WSI), and require using lexical resources such as WordNet AUTHOR and BabelNet AUTHOR that provide a rich mapping of terms (or word forms) onto the corresponding senses (word meanings). These widely used resources provide in fact subtle distinctions between the possible senses of a term. It is largely acknowledged that while fine-grained sense distinctions are necessary for some precise tasks (such as machine translation), for other sorts of applications (such as text categorization and information extraction) coarse-grained sense inventories are preferable AUTHOR. In these cases, fine-grained distinctions may be unnecessary and even detrimental to WSD and WSI, so that in the last few years many efforts concentrated on clustering senses. Most works focused on producing coarser-grained sense inventories, to the ends of grouping together the closest (partially overlapped) senses of a word; to these ends, various techniques have been carried out, that are briefly surveyed in Section related-work. Differently from existing approaches, we propose a simple yet effective method that relies on recently developed resources that are assumed to also grasp common-sense knowledge AUTHOR, which is assumed to be both widely accessible and elementary knowledge AUTHOR, and to reflect typicality traits encoded as prototypical knowledge AUTHOR. The research question presently addressed is thus: To what extent can we individuate few principal ---common-sense--- senses for a term, and in how far is it possible to approximate human performance? Although it is known that even human annotators provide quite different response when annotating text with senses AUTHOR, we presently explore the hypothesis that wide-coverage resources are sufficient to individuate the main senses associated to English terms.","In this paper we have illustrated the \SST algorithm to extract the most salient (under the common-sense perspective) senses associated to a given term; also, we have introduced the \SST resource, which has been built by starting from the 15K top frequency English terms.

Our work relies on a recently developed resource such as NASARI that is multilingual in nature.-linguistic perspective, which is a well-known issue, e.g., for applications in the legal field AUTHOR. Consequently, different from most previous approaches, \SST can be linked to various existing resources aimed at grasping common-sense to complete the ideal chain connecting lexicon, semantics and formal (ontological) description. The experimentation revealed a reasonable agreement with human responses, and pointed out some difficulties in fully assessing this sort of resource. These issues, along with improvements to the heuristics implemented by the algorithm and a different evaluation based on a shared NLP task, will be addressed in future work.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The types of word formation rules are discussed and the semi-automatic procedure to pair their input and output lexical items is evaluated. An on-line graphical query system to access the lexicon is described as well.,"In the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), derivational morphology has always been neglected if compared to inflectional morphology, which plays a central role in fundamental annotation tasks like PoS tagging. Yet enhancing textual data with derivational morphology tagging promises to provide strong outcomes. First, it organises the lexicon at higher level than words, by building word formation based sets of lexical items sharing a common derivational ancestor. Secondly, derivational morphology acts like a kind of interface between morphology and semantics, since core semantic properties are shared at different extent by words built by a common word formation process. Lately, some lexical resources for derivational morphology have been made available. Among them are the lexical network for Czech DeriNet AUTHOR, the derivational lexicon for German DErivBASE (AUTHOR) and that for Italian derIvaTario (AUTHOR). Furthermore, stemming is a technique largely used for detecting word formation processes (AUTHOR), and language independent NLP tools were trained to extract derivation information from inflectional lexica (AUTHOR). On the Classical languages front, although the number of resources and NLP tools for Ancient Greek and Latin is now manifold and varied (ranging from digital libraries, treebanks and computational lexica to PoS taggers and parsers), no lexical resource for derivational morphology is available yet, where words are connected by word formation processes. The first steps towards building such a word formation lexicon for Latin were made by AUTHOR, who described a model for the semi-automatic extraction of word formation rules from the list of lemmas of Lexicon Totius Latinitatis by Forcellini (fifth edition; 1940) and the subsequent pairing of lexical entries and their derivational ancestor(s). The Word Formation Latin project has received funding from the EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship to expand on these efforts and create a word formation lexicon (working as an NLP tool as well) for Latin. In this paper, we describe the steps undertaken to build such a lexicon. The paper is organised as follows.

However, the available evidences are discordant. In this study we tried to disentangle grammatical class effects from semantic categories effects during visual word recognition by exploiting the semantic priming paradigm.Semantically related prime-target pair were arranged. They could share (verb-verb) or not (noun-verb) grammatical class information. A third condition was included where noun primes and verb targets had both an action as a referent (delitti/uccide, crimes/he-she kills). Only prime/target pairs sharing grammatical class information showed significant semantic priming effects. Results are compatible with the hypothesis that grammatical class is an organizational criterion in the mental lexicon and it is activated during lexical access.","Psychological and neural evidence revealed that the distinction between parts of speech, mainly nouns and verbs, occurring in all languages AUTHOR affects speaker’s performance: grammatical class is preserved in speech errors AUTHOR and nouns and verbs can be selectively disrupted in aphasic populations AUTHOR. An influential hypothesis states that the grammatical class is an organizing principle in the mental lexicon AUTHOR but the picture of empirical data is actually multifaceted and often inconsistent (AUTHOR). For the sake of conciseness, here we focus on two examples of alternative interpretations about the role of grammatical class in lexical representation and processing of words. A first position, mostly grounded on word production data (AUTHOR), is that grammatical class information, although lexically represented, is only retrieved under specific circumstances, namely in sentence or phrasal contexts (AUTHOR). However, grammatical class effects are significantly reported in word production even in tasks not requiring syntactic integration (AUTHOR). A stronger lexicalist view is held in the field of recognition and comprehension processes and conceives grammatical class as a feature of words that is automatically retrieved during lexical access. Comparisons between noun/verb homographs (condannato N (the convict) vs. condannato V (past participle, convicted), AUTHOR) and homonymic nominal and verbal forms (saliva N, spittle vs. saliva V, he/she went up, AUTHOR) revealed the possibility that separate, grammatical class-specific representations are present in the lexicon. Also in this case, different patterns of data have been described (AUTHOR). A possible reason for such a divergence relies on the fact that grammatical class effects are often not clearly distinguishable from the influence of confounding variables, i.e. the imageability of words, the number of inflectional alternatives for nominal and verbal stems, the argumental structure of nouns and verbs and so on. A challenging issue is that noun/verb distinction is not lexical in nature but relies on an object/action distinction (AUTHOR). Here we aim at verifying whether lexical access to input orthographic representations of Italian verbs can be affected by the pre-activation of grammatical class information. The semantic priming paradigm was exploited and the expected facilitation effect on target verbs elicited by semantically related primes was compared across prime/target pairs sharing or not grammatical class information, i.e., noun/verb pairs vs. verb/verb pairs. In order to disentangle the possible confound between grammatical class (nouns vs. verbs) and semantic categories which nouns and verbs belong to (objects vs. actions), two different types of noun-verb pairs were used: object nouns denoting objects (candela, candle) vs. nouns denoting actions (sberla, slap). We reasoned as follows: if grammatical class informs input orthographic representations of words, its pre-activation through primes should speed up targets recognition even in a lexical decision task where any process of syntactic integration is not involved. On the contrary, semantic priming effects are expected to equally affect prime/target pairs regardless their grammatical relation. No interaction between grammatical class and semantic relation is expected because the two variables are supposed to affect lexical selection with distinct modalities (AUTHOR).","Our purpose here was to clarify whether grammatical class works as an organizational criterion of word representations within the mental lexicon. In particular, we aimed at demonstrating that words from different grammatical classes tend to be processed differently by speakers not only because of their differences in terms of semantic categories they belong to (actions vs. objects) or of semantic features (imageability) but also because their lexical representations specify their role as different parts of speech. From an empirical point of view, our purpose was to verify: - whether grammatical class information is automatically activated when orthographic representations of Italian verbs are accessed; - whether grammatical class effects can be detected in tasks that do not explicitly require syntactic integration processes, that is during the processing of isolated words; - whether grammatical class effects are an epiphenomenon of the semantic categories to which nouns and verbs belong to or if they are truly grammatical in nature. We addressed the issue by exploiting the semantic priming effect, a robust and well-known effect in word recognition consisting in the advantage in lexical decision tasks exhibited by target words when preceded by semantically related primes and compared to an unrelated baseline. Our experimental design was suitable to investigate the problem for two main reasons: • it allows to pre-activate a definite linguistic feature, i.e. grammatical class (nouns vs. verbs) information and/or a semantic category (actions vs. objects), and to observe whether such a property can affect word processing; • it rules out the intervention of any confound due to syntactic integration process because it focuses on lexical access to single word representations. With that aim, we manipulated the congruency of grammatical class in different kinds of prime/target pairs. The rationale of the experiment was the following: if grammatical class informs lexical representation of words, its pre-activation through the prime should modulate the expected effects of semantic priming. In order to specifically disentangle the role of grammatical class from the influence of semantic category of referents of nouns and verbs, we observed the effect in different conditions: grammatically congruent prime/target pairs, prime/target pairs from incongruent grammatical classes but both belonging to the semantic category of actions, and prime/target pairs from incongruent grammatical classes and different semantic categories (objects for nouns and actions for verbs). Our results showed that semantic priming is effective only for prime/target pairs sharing grammatical class information; much weaker effects were detected for noun/verb pairs, regardless of the semantic category of the referents. This pattern of data seems to indicate that grammatical class informs lexical representations in the orthographic input lexicon since its pre-activation through the prime modulates the expected facilitation induced by semantically related primes. In other words, grammatical class is likely to be automatically activated during lexical access to written representation of Italian verbs and, in addition, it is effective during processing of verbal forms presented outside a sentence context. This effect seems to have a truly grammatical basis as it is not elicited by grammatically incongruent prime/target pairs. Moreover, in our experiment the congruency of grammatical class between prime and target does not interact with the semantic similarity between prime and target: this suggests that the two sources of information affect the word recognition process with distinct modalities. This pattern of data, although preliminary, adds new challenging details to the debate about lexical representation of grammatical class information and provides evidence in favor of the lexicalist models that conceive grammatical class as an intrinsic property of the lexical representation consulted during lexical access which is necessarily and automatically accessed at least during written word recognition processes.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The paper has three goals: (i) to describe the SQL resources produced during the construction of the lexicon; (ii) to describe the algorithm for building the lexicon; (iii) to present an ongoing work for enhancing the lexicon by using the syntactic information extracted from a treebank.,"A number of free large multilingual resources covering Italian have been released, e.g. MultiWordnet, UniversalWordnet, BabelNet AUTHOR. Moreover, several lexical corpora have been built specifically for Italian, as the detailed map of the Italian NLP resources produced within the PARLI project shows}. Unfortunately most resources are designed to represent lexical semantics rather than morpho-syntactic relations among the words. As a consequence, these resources cannot be employed in statistical or rule-based natural language morho-syntactic analyzer or generator. A notable exception is the PAROLE-SIMPLE-CLIPS lexicon, that is a four-level (i.e. phonological, morphological, syntactical, semantic) general purpose lexicon composed by 53,044 lemmata AUTHOR. Unfortunately, a strong limitation for the usage of PAROLE-SIMPLE-CLIPS is the licence, since it is not freely available for research or commercial use. Rule-based natural language realization engines, that are systems performing linearisation and morphological inflections of a proto-syntactic input tree AUTHOR, need wide coverage morpho-syntactic information as knowledge-base. In other words, to perform realization, that is the last step of natural language generation AUTHOR, one needs two main kinds of linguistic knowledge: (i) the grammatical/syntactical knowledge that specifies the syntactic rules of the language and which is usually encoded into formal rules; (ii) the morphological and lexical knowledge, which is usually encoded into a computational lexicon. In the porting of the SimpleNLG system to Italian (henceforth SimpleNLG-IT) AUTHOR, we have used the grammar AUTHOR as the linguistic reference for the syntax: we have encoded the Italian syntactic inflections and word ordering by using IF-THEN-ELSE rules in Java. However, since Italian has a high number of irregularities for verb and adjective inflections, we needed for a specifically designed computational lexicon too. We needed for a lexicon that has both a good coverage and a detailed account of the morphological irregularities. In order to build this specific lexicon, that we have called SimpleLEX-IT, we have decided to merge three free resources for Italian, namely Morph-it! AUTHOR, the Vocabolario di base della lingua italiana AUTHOR and, for some specific issues, Wikipedia. The differences between the three resources can be referred to both the reasons for which the authors developed them and the adopted methodology and approach they applied in their development: the first is a hand-made list of basic words; the second one is an extensional corpus based morphological lexicon; the third one is a collection of encyclopedic entries about irregular verbs in Italian. This paper is organized as follows: in Section sql we describe the conversion of the three lexical resources used into a relational database; in Section lexicon we provide some details about the algorithm used to build SimpleLEX-IT; in Section wip we describe a work in progress to enrich the lexicon by using the syntactic information extracted from a treebank; finally, Section conclusions closes the paper with conclusions.","In this paper we have presented some issues about the computational lexicon SimpleLEX-IT. We described the algorithm used to build the lexicon, three SQL resources produced as side effects of the lexicon building and a work in progress about the extraction of syntactic information from UD-IT. %In future work we want to extend our treebank based approach for adjectives word order.

We investigated automatic event classification and used Active Learning to reduce the cost of acquiring domain-specific training data.","This work focuses on understanding the content of live commentaries of sport games. This form of written reporting has become very popular in recent years, and almost every national Italian online newspaper has a section dedicated to live sport commentaries. Live commentaries have several interesting properties: (i) they are short descriptions of an event written by professionals while the event is happening; their form is much simpler than a full spoken running commentary; (ii) they have a clear and simple structure, typically based on the timing of the sport event; (iii) they are often associated with metadata (e.g. La Roma passa in vantaggio [Roma takes the lead] is associated with the metadata GOAL); (iv) finally, they describe visual scenes, which is relevant to automatic alignment of multimedia content (e.g. align a sequence of frames in a video with the corresponding commentary), a topic of emerging interest in Computational Linguistics (see, for instance, AUTHOR). Our work is part of a larger cross-disciplinary project, Understanding Multimedia Content, currently involving several research groups at FBK. In this paper we first define an annotation framework for the semantic interpretation of online soccer commentaries in Italian (Section sec:annotschema), which includes the detection and classification of relevant events, as well as the identification of their argument structure. Based on this annotation schema, which could also be used for the annotation of tweets or other short online comments, we manually annotated a collection of commentaries in Italian to be used as a gold standard (Section sec:golsstandard). As a first step towards a comprehensive system for automatic interpretation of soccer events we focused on event detection and classification (i.e. event extraction), and used Active Learning to build a training corpus (Section sec:eventExtraction). We show that this procedure is very effective, allowing our system to reach an F1 of 77.25, with considerable savings of annotation time (Section sec:evaluation).","We presented a new annotation framework for the interpretation of online soccer commentaries, as well as the reference annotated corpus we created. We also described our system for event extraction from live soccer commentaries in Italian. It exploits the TextPro-AL Active Learning platform, which allowed us to reach a significant F1 (77.25) in seven working days of a non-expert annotator. The annotation was performed for Italian but the method and the annotation schema we devised can be applied to other languages. The only language dependent component is the feature extractor used by the event detection module. As for ongoing work, we are working at parameter optimization on the Active Learning framework (particularly, we are interested in the relations between the size of the unlabeled dataset, the frequency of the re-training, and the confidence score used by the selection procedure). We also plan to extend the current system by adding the detection of the argument structure of events. We thank Valentino Frasnelli for his contribution, which consisted of manually annotating the data.

The aim of L-KD is to help finding and tracing themes in English and Italian text data, represented by groups of keyphrases and associated domains. We perform an evaluation of the top-ranked domains using the 20 Newsgroup dataset, and we show that 8 domains out of 10 match with manually assigned labels. This confirms the good accuracy of this approach, which does not require supervision.","With the increasing availability of large document collections in digital format, companies, organizations but also non-expert users face everyday the need to efficiently extract and categorize relevant information from large corpora. The possibility to extract key-concepts and assign them to a domain without the need of supervision would allow them to systematically track the flow of information and retain only relevant content at two granularity levels: key-concepts, and domains to which these key-concepts can be ascribed. Although topic models AUTHOR can be used to this purpose, they have two main drawbacks: the number of topics for a corpus is arbitrary and topics are often not labelled. \\ In this work, we present a solution to the aforementioned research problem by presenting L-KD (Labelled-KD), a tool to perform keyphrase clustering and labelling through the exploitation of external linguistic and knowledge resources. The tool takes advantage of the availability of Keyphrase Digger} (KD), a multilingual rule-based system that detects a weighted list of n-grams representing the most important concepts in a text AUTHOR.

Resorting to crowd-sourcing may be a viable solution. We expect lower performances than the ones obtained for English, given that the current mapping between Open Multilingual WordNet and WordNet 3.0 covers only the 32.5\% of the English synsets: this consequently affects the mapping on the domains of WND.

Despite the official initiatives taken by the AIFA, such as the creation of the Drug Data Bank to help users to use drugs correctly, understanding the benefits and possible side effects, it is known that the language used in these and other medical texts (and not only) is complex and often not adapted to the competences of citizens.

The corpus has been built by crawling the Facebook pages of the most important newspapers in Italy and it has been organized into topics using LDA. In this work we provide a preliminary analysis of the corpus, including the most debated news in 2015.","The use of Social Networks (SN) platforms like Facebook and Twitter has developed overwhelmingly in recent years. SN are exploited for different purposes ranging from the sharing of contents among friends and useful contacts to the newsgathering about different domains such as politics and sports AUTHOR. Many journalists indeed use SN platforms for professional reasons AUTHOR. Several recent studies provide insights on how the popularity of blogs and other user generated content impacted the way in which news are consumed and reported. AUTHOR states that SN platforms provide an easy and affordable way to take part in discussions with larger groups of people and, consequently, the bond between SN and information is becoming increasingly stronger. Mass information is gradually moving towards general platforms, and official websites are losing their lead position in providing information. As noted by AUTHOR, even though the use of internet in the years 2009-2012 has grown, the same is not reflected in the consumption of online newspapers, probably because of the increasing use of SN for news diffusion and gathering. If on the one hand this apparent decline of the traditional news platforms may lead to a decline in quality and news coverage AUTHOR, on the other hand the rise of SN as platforms to spread news promotes a more fervid debate between users AUTHOR. This issue is central for the present work. In fact, user's comments very often contain their own opinions about a certain issue. In addition, because of the colloquial style of the comments, they contain large amounts of words and collocations with a high subjective content, mostly concerning the author's emotive stance. Facebook is one of the most popular online SN in the world with 1 billion active users per month and it offers the possibility to collect data from people of different ages, educational levels and cultures. From a linguistic point of view, previous studies AUTHOR demonstrated that the language in Facebook is more emotional and interpersonal compared for example to the language in Twitter. Probably, this is due to the fact that in Facebook there is a stronger psychological closeness between the author and audience because of the different structure (bidirectional vs. unidirectional graphs) of the SNs. In this paper we present the FB-NEWS15 corpus, a new Italian resource for sentiment analysis and emotion detection. The FB-NEWS15 corpus can be freely downloaded at under the Creative Commons Attribution License. The debate among users in commenting news and posts on Facebook offers a lot of subjective material to study the way in which people express their own opinions and emotions about a target event. In fact, in FB-NEWS15 we find linguistic items expressing the whole range of positive and negative emotions. In analyzing a news corpus, however, it is not simple to aggregate the posts on the basis of a certain fact, since several posts relate to the same event. For this reason, we decided to organize the corpus into clusters of topically related news identified with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA: AUTHOR). This approach allow us to infer the most debated news in the corpus, and, in a second step, to discover the readers' sentiment about a particular topic. The paper is organized as follows: Section fb-news15 describes the creation of the corpus, from crawling (crawling) to linguistic annotation (taln), and finally provides basic corpus statistics (analysis). Section topics reports on the automatic topic extraction with LDA.","As one of the most widespread social networks, Facebook offers the possibility to collect opinionated pieces of texts from people of different ages, cultures and education. The composition of FB-NEWS15, in which each comment is explicitly associated with a particular post, allows us to study the differences in terms of readers' perceptions about a particular topic. Differently from other social media like Twitter, Facebook contains larger texts including lot of subjective expressions that are very useful for the construction of sentiment and emotive lexicons. Starting from previous works AUTHOR, we plan to use this corpus to build lexical resources for sentiment analysis and emotion detection, which will include both words and complex terms. In addition, we plan to optimize the topic modeling phase and to investigate the possibility of using the extracted topics as a prior for inferring the sentiment orientation of a particular comment.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

To understand the impact of homonymy, we discuss an experiment on four Latin texts of different era and genre.","Ambiguity affects linguistic analysis at various levels. In particular, homonymy plays a substantial role in the analysis of single words. Indeed, when considered out of context, one same word can be assigned different Parts of Speech (PoS), morphological features, lemmas and meanings. Contextual disambiguation is the task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like PoS-taggers, morphological analysers, lemmatisers and word-sense disambiguators. The problem of ambiguity is particularly remarkable for NLP when Named Entity Recognition (NER) is concerned. In order to automatically classify the textual occurrences of (multi)words into categories such as names of persons, locations and organisations, NER faces that specific kind of ambiguity consisting in the homonymy between proper names and other words in the lexicon (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007). For instance, the word mark in English can be a proper name, a noun or a verb. Although such homonymy is often tackled by using the upper/lowercase distinction for the initial letter of words, this solution is neither decisive (as uppercase letters can also be motivated by punctuation) nor always available. The latter is especially true for historical languages, as a large amount of texts in such languages comes with no upper/lowercase distinction and it may follow different editorial criteria. The recent extension of the lexical basis of the morphological analyser and lemmatiser for Latin Lemlat with an Onomasticon (i.e. a list of proper names) makes it possible to evaluate the degree of homonymy of proper names in Latin and, thus, to understand the extent of the disambiguation task (Passarotti and Ruffolo, 2004). To this aim, in this paper we explore the lexical basis of Lemlat as providing the empirical evidence supporting our analysis on homonymy between names in the Onomasticon and words in the Latin lexicon.","We presented a study about the degree of homonymy between the lexical basis of a morphological analyser for Latin and an Onomasticon recently added in the tool. We have shown the impact of nominal homonymy on a number of Latin texts of different era and genre. Since the analysis of many homonymous words can be disambiguated according to the features of single texts (and authors), in the near future we foresee to enhance such words in Lemlat with information about their distribution in a number of manually tagged reference texts.",5,Latin Resources

In this work we propose a new classification of sentiment polarity that exploits the barrier features, originally introduced for the classification of relationships extracted from texts. Empirical data sets tests used in the SemEval2014 competition show that the proposed approach exceeds the performance of baseline systems in most cases.","Sentiment analysis (SA) AUTHOR, or opinion mining, is mainly about finding out the feelings of people from data such as product reviews and news articles. Most methods adopt a two-step strategy for SA AUTHOR: in the subjectivity classification step, the target is classified to be subjective or neutral (objective), while in the polarity classification step the subjective targets are further classified as positive or negative. Therefore, two classifiers are trained for the whole SA process: the subjectivity classifier and the polarity classifier. Polarity is an aspect of sentiment analysis which can be faced as a three-way classification problem, in that it aims to associate either a positive, negative or neutral polarity to each tweet. Expressions in tweets are often ambiguous because they are very informal messages no longer than 140 characters, containing a lot of misspelled words, slang, modal particles and acronyms.The characteristics of the employed language are very different from more formal documents and we expect statistical methods trained on tweets to perform well thanks to an automatic adaptation to such specifications. As identified by tasks included in competitions AUTHOR and AUTHOR, twitter sentiment analysis is a relevant topic for scientific research. To the best of our knowledge AUTHOR present a comprehensive, State-of-the-Art (SoA) review on the research work done in various aspects of SA. Furthermore some approaches, as described in AUTHOR, are based on the combination of several existing SoA ""off-the-shelf'' methods for sense-level sentiment analysis. AUTHOR proposes an approach based on the notion that the sentiment of a term depends on its contextual semantics and some trigonometric properties on SentiCircles, that is a 2D geometric circle. These properties are applied to amend an initial sentiment score of terms, according to the context in which they are used. The sentiment identification at either entity or tweet-level is then performed by levering trigonometric identities on SentiCircles. The approach we are proposing has been experimentally assigned by comparing its performance with two baseline systems. In addition to that, the capacity of adaptation of the approach to slightly different domains has been tested by comparison on a web-blog data set the performances of two systems in which the Barrier Feature(BF) dictionary has been historically built on a collection of tweets and Wikipedia webpages. Eventually, the contribution of BF has been evaluated.","We explored the effectiveness of BFs for sentiment polarity classification in Twitter posts and we showed on SemEval2014 data sets that they can be very effective. In our approach, the need of a manual intervention is really minimum. Indeed, the BFs dictionary can be built from any collection of tweets, even one that do not belong to the same domain of the considered task. This is quite interesting because it suggests that BFs are able to capture hints about the polarity of the expressions in a domain independent way. \hide{ Interestingly, the considered training set is not very large. This means that ones the BF dictionary is built in an unsupervised manner, a classier based on such features do not need a large training set to attack good performance. Last, but not least, we intend to further explore the LiveJournal2014 data set by collecting a weblog corpus from the web. Although this is not a straightforward task, such a data set would allow us to verify whether we can obtain a better performance on LiveJournal2014 data set when the BF dictionary is built on a corpus made of the same kind of texts, even if they consider different subjects.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

In this perspective, ontologies - and the OWL, their standard language of representation - play a fundamental role. However, the fundamentally static nature of the latter and the need to shape aspects of temporal evolution seem at first glance irreconcilable. The reflections that we present in this article are born from the experiences carried out within the Project Clavius on the Web. Among the objectives of the Project, in fact, there is also that of creating a termino-ontological resource (RTO) that represents the evolution of mathematical-astronomical theories from antiquity to the sixteenth - seventeenth century, as described by Clavius in his Euclids Elementorum Libri XV.

It is intended to deepen this research taking into account the aspects which, of course, follow the most essential aspects of the formalization of terminology and knowledge.

By comparatively examining two treebanks of Latin and ancient Greek, AUTHOR's study showed that the flexibility of the syntactic order, measured as the distance between the actual length of the dependencies of a sentence and its optimal AUTHOR length, is an element of complexity that can be deduced both from the lower precision of the automatic parsing in the analysis of these languages, and from the tendency that is found over time towards fixed order patterns of constituents. This article proposes a quantitative study for Italian, VO type (or initial head) and relatively unflexible, aimed at investigating whether, and to what extent, the natural or unmarked disposition of constituents in the sentence is influenced by the textual genre and the complexity of the language used in the text. To this end, two linguistic, narrative and journalistic genres have been compared, in turn distinguished in two different linguistic varieties by degree of complexity, where this degree is defined in relation to the reference reader. Unlike the traditional corpus--based analysis of the order of constituents in Italian, all the data discussed here are derived from an automatic body annotated up to the level of syntactic analysis dependent on them.\ Although the reconstruction of the syntactic structure by a statistical parser is inevitably subject to some AUTHOR errors, which increase for the texts of a domain distant from that of the AUTHOR training, the variety of phenomena that can be monitored with reliability starting from an automatic linguistic analysis is very wide and complex.\ The linguistic--computational perspective opens up promising research perspectives for the construction and validation on a large scale of theoretical models on the functioning of linguistic systems both in a typological key and compared to the traditional axes of linguistic variation. The following will be presented first the corporations used in this study and then the monitoring methodology on which the extraction of the linguistic characteristics under investigation was based (paragraph sec:preprocessing); in paragraph sec: analysis we will discuss the main results obtained and finally draw some conclusions of this research.","This article proposed a comparative study on a particular phenomenon related to syntactic complexity, that is the order of constituents in Italian. The comparison was conducted on two levels: gender variation and degree of complexity. %: The objective was to verify which systems of constituents depend on the textual genre, such as the simplification process, and which by both. As regards the first, it has been possible to note that the journalistic texts are those that most adhere to the canonical order of the elements, while the narrative texts have reported a higher frequency of marked orders. From the point of view of complexity, it is clear the tendency in both genres to use the canonical order as a result of simplification, both following a process of simplification of an original text, and when the text is natively conceived as a simple text. Regardless of gender, the most complex phenomenon is the use of subordinates. In both genera clearly prevail subordinate poses to the main as they are easier to process and when this position is not respected there is a tendency to simplify the subordinate itself both in terms of number of words, but above all structurally, in terms of depth of the syntactic subtree. Finally, it should be recalled that all the observations contained in this study are based on texts that are automatically noted, which are therefore subject to error. Despite this, we expect that at least limited to the analysis of texts of the same domain and variety of language, the distributions of errors are similar, thus allowing an internal comparison with the linguistic parameters investigated. The reliability of the data discussed is also corroborated by the fact that they were considered standard texts, linguistically close to those on which automatic annotation tools are typically trained. On the other hand, precisely because the distribution of errors may vary as the domain of texts changes, among the developments of this work we intend to carry out sample analyses to verify the impact of the error on the comparisons obtained with the different structures examined.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

They can be extracted from corpora automatically. The purpose of this paper is demonstrating that their vector representation based on word embedding provides insights onto many linguistic phenomena, such as causative-inchoative verbs. A first experiment aims at investigating the internal structure of the sets, which are known to be radial and continuous categories cognitively. A second experiment shows that the distance between the intransitive subject set and transitive object set is correlated with the spontaneity of the event expressed by the verb, defined according to morphological coding and frequency.","Lexicographic attempts to cope with verb sense disambiguation often rely on ``lexical sets'' AUTHOR, which represent the lists of corpus-derived words that appear as arguments for each distinct verb sense. The arguments are the ``slots'' that have to be filled to satisfy the valency of a verb (subject, object, etc.). For example, \{gun, bullet, shot, projectile, rifle...\} is the lexical set of the object for the sense `to shoot' of to fire. In previous works, e.g. AUTHOR, lexical sets were collected manually and were compared through set analysis. The measure of similarity between two sets was proportional to the extent of their intersection. We believe that possible improvements may stem from deriving the lexical sets automatically and from exploiting the semantic information of the fillers fully. In this work, we devise an extraction method from a huge corpus and use a distributional semantics approach to perform our analyses. More specifically, we represent fillers as word vectors and compare them with spatial distance measures. In order to test the relevance for linguistic theory of this approach, we focus on a case study, namely the properties of verbs undergoing the causative-inchoative alternation. Section 1.1. outlines a framework for word embeddings and section 1.2 introduces the case study. Section 2 presents the method and the data, whereas section 3 reports the results of a couple of experiments.","Our work provided evidence that lexical sets of Italian causative-inchoative verbs are continuous and radial categories, whose distribution around the prototype vary to a great extent. It is sensitive to the grammatical role and sometimes to the position of the verb in the so-called spontaneity scale. Moreover, a correlation was discovered between the distance between transitive object and intransitive subject lexical sets of a given verb and its cross-linguistic tendency to appear more frequently as intransitive or as transitive.

The dotted line, on the other hand, suggests the existence of and underlying motivation for the correlations, which nonetheless remains unproven and undetermined in its nature. Its possible validation is left to future research. Future works should also choose different pre-trained vector models, in order to try and replicate these results. In particular, the new vector models could be optimized for similarity through semantic lexica AUTHOR or based on syntactic dependencies AUTHOR.

In this paper we apply this approach to automatically identify the areas of semantic change in the lexicon of Ancient Greek between the pre-Christian and Christian era. Distributional Semantic Models are used to identify meaningful clusters and patterns of semantic shift within a set of target words, defined through a purely data-driven approach. The results emphasize the role played by the diffusion of Christianity and by technical languages in determining semantic change in Ancient Greek and show the potentialities of distributional models in diachronic semantics.","Distributional Semantics is grounded on the assumption that the meaning of a word can be described as a function of its collocates in a corpus. This suggests that diachronic meaning shifts can be traced through changes in the distribution of these collocates over time AUTHOR. While some studies focused on testing the explanatory power of this method over frequency- and syntax-based approaches AUTHOR, more advanced contributions to the field explored how distributional models can be used to test competing hypotheses about semantic change AUTHOR, or to investigate the productivity of constructions in diachrony AUTHOR. The results attest the explanatory power of distributional methods in modeling diachronic shifts in meaning. In this paper, we propose a method to identify semantic change through the Representational Similarity Analysis AUTHOR of distributional vector spaces built from diachronic corpora. RSA is a method extensively used in neuroscience to test cognitive and computational models by comparing the geometry of their representation spaces AUTHOR. Stimuli are represented with a representational dissimilarity matrix that contains a measure of the dissimilarity relations of the stimuli with each other. Different matrices are compared to evaluate the correspondence of the representational spaces built from different sources (e.g., behavioral and neuroimaging data). We argue that this method can be applied to compare distributional representations of the lexicon at different temporal stages. The hypothesis is that the elements in the lexical spaces showing larger geometrical variations in time correspond to the lexical areas that have undergone major semantic changes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time RSA is used in diachronic distributional semantics. Here we present a case study that applies RSA to track patterns of semantic change within the lexicon of Ancient Greek. We focus on the first few centuries AD, when the rise of Christianity caused a deep and widespread cultural shift within the Hellenic world. We predict that this shift will be reflected in the Greek lexicon of the time. In addition to past studies AUTHOR, we apply a bottom-up approach to the detection of semantic change, with no prior definition of a list of lemmas to be analyzed. The goal is to develop a quantitative “discovery procedure” to detect lexical semantic changes.
From a methodological standpoint, this study aims to show how Distributional Semantics can be applied fruitfully to such a small and literary corpus as the collection of Ancient Greek texts. The results will also highlight the ways in which Distributional Semantics can complement the intuition of the researcher in analyzing semantic change in Ancient Greek, providing a useful tool for future studies in Classics.","This paper shows how Distributional Semantics can be used as an exploratory tool to detect semantic change. In this case study on Ancient Greek, the proposed method based on distributional RSA not only confirms the hypothesis that the diffusion of Christianity was a crucial cause of semantic change in the Greek lexicon, but also allows for the identification of unexpected patterns of evolution, such as the apparent specialization in the usage of technical terms. This last phenomenon could also be influenced by the fact that the AD-corpus is richer in philosophical and technical treatises; however, a documented change in the proportion of different possible usages of a word is in itself a very informative result, especially in a field such as Classics, where the analysis of (literary) texts is paramount. Further research should undoubtedly highlight the effect of corpus composition. A focus on shorter periods of time might be of interest, since, for instance, the rise of technical prose writing is a characteristic of the Hellenistic Age AUTHOR. From a methodological standpoint, the fact that the results obtained from such a small corpus of purely literary texts are both meaningful and informative is of great relevance. Furthermore, the choice to adopt a data-driven approach proved fruitful, in that it brought to light directions of change that were not expected a priori. For traditional research in Classics, a computational approach to the lexicon of Ancient Greek is compelling because it provides new information about a language for which the judgments of native speakers are unavailable AUTHOR. The results of this study show how Distributional Semantics can complement the assertions of the philologist, as well as help discover patterns of lexical change that would otherwise be impossible to grasp beyond an intuitive level.",22,Distributional Semantics

In this paper, we want to investigate quantitative aspects of the use on Facebook of the Sardinian language. In particular, we want to focus on the co-existence of diatopic varieties. We extracted linguistic data from public pages and, through the translation of the most frequent words, we find out similarities and differences between varieties.","Everyday life makes an increasingly extensive use of digital devices that involve language use; for this reason, usability of a language over digital devices is a sign for that language of being modern, relevant to current lifestyles and capable of facing the needs of the XXI century. A positive correlation between presence in new technologies and better appreciation of a language has been repeatedly observed in the literature, see for instance AUTHOR and AUTHOR. Regional and minority languages (RMLs henceforth) are usually very poorly represented digitally AUTHOR. \\Since poor digital representation of regional and minority languages further prevents their usability on digital media and devices, it is extremely important to enhance every bottom-up effort that can boost the quantity of available digital content. In fact, if the perception of the marginal role and limited applicability of RMLs persists, their attractiveness diminishes. \\An increase in quantity of digital content available online represents today an opportunity for regional and minority languages. Online speakers can make visible the existence of a community that uses the language to interact; they can use online communication to converge toward a standard and they can instruct less skilled speakers toward better mastering of the rules of the language, especially when the language is not formally included in education. From the perspective of computational linguistics, the presence of digital content written in RMLs means that corpora can be built for them and basic tools (lemmatizers, spell checkers, lexicons etc.) can be developed. \\The presence of RMLs over digital media and their usability through digital devices is often limited to instances of digital activism and/or by means of cultural initiatives focused on the preservation of cultural heritage. \\In this paper we promote the first study we are aware of about the use on social networks (more specifically, Facebook) of Sardinian, an Italian minority language characterised by the coexistence of varieties and the difficulties for the promoted standard to emerge as unifying factor. Our starting hypothesis concerned the vitality on social networks of a language that is mainly spoken. With the help of a Sardinian linguist, we identified a small set of FB public groups where specific varieties of Sardinian are chosen as their main language plus groups where generic, not further defined Sardinian is used to communicate. We extracted messages from these pages and created a frequency lexicon for each variety. The most frequent 150 words have been translated by a Sardophone expert linguist with the aim of finding differences and commonalities between varieties. This preliminary analysis is the first step toward the use of computational linguistics methodologies in the promotion of a standard for Sardinian based on quantitative data.","In this paper we address the following open question: could quantitative analysis of written data help Sardinian community to find out a common core (not specific of a variety) that could reinvigorate the idea of a standard? We plan future work on this issue, with the awareness that digital content on social media is both an opportunity and a challenge for this kind of analyses. \\This paper is a first analysis of diatopic varieties of Sardinian through orthographical comparisons of word forms with the same meaning. Thanks to translated lists it was possible to look at commonalities and differences between varieties. Social media are a source of real data about language uses and the best observatory for regional and minority languages. Concerning Sardinian Facebook offers the possibility to test the distance between the proposed orthographic standard and the existing varieties. We will test the interplay between varieties with other methodologies to measure the distance and to find out usage patterns (e.g. Levenshtein distance for similar words). \\This work is being carried out in the framework of the project DLDP (Digital Language Diversity Project, http://www.dldp.eu). DLDP is a three year project funded under the Erasmus+ programme. It aims at addressing the problem of low digital representation of EU regional and minority languages by giving their speakers the intellectual and practical skills to create, share, and reuse online digital content.

These were obtained by replacing the components of the original expression with semantically related words. Our indices performed comparably or better than other compositionality measures reported in the distributional literature.,"While a white car is white and is a car, a red herring in a sentence like I thought he was the culprit, but he was a red herring is neither red nor a herring, but indicates something that distracts someone from a relevant issue. The former expression is compositional, since its meaning derives from the composition of the meanings of its subparts AUTHOR. The latter, by contrast, is an idiom, a non-compositional, figurative and proverbial word combination belonging to the wider class of Multiword Expressions AUTHOR. The compositionality of a given expression entails salva-veritate-interchangeability and systematicity AUTHOR. First of all, if we replace the constituents of a compositional expression with synonyms or similar words (e.g., from white car to white automobile), the whole meaning is not altered. Secondly, if we can understand the meaning of white car and red herring used in the literal sense, we can also understand what white herring and red car mean. Both these properties are not valid for idioms, which always exhibit lexical fixedness to some extent: variants of idiomatic red herring like red fish or white herring can just have a literal reading. Computational studies to date have proposed several techniques to automatically measure idiomaticity. Of note, AUTHOR and AUTHOR label a given word combination as idiomatic if the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) AUTHOR between its component words is higher than the PMIs between the components of a set of lexical variants of this combination. These variants are obtained by replacing the component words of the original expressions with semantically related words. Other researches have exploited Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) AUTHOR, comparing the vector of a given phrase with the single vectors of its subparts AUTHOR or comparing the vector of a phrase with the vector deriving from the sum or the products of their components AUTHOR. In a previous contribution AUTHOR, we started from a set of Italian verbal idiomatic and non-idiomatic phrases (henceforth our targets) and generated lexical variants (simply variants henceforth) by replacing their components with semantic neighbours extracted from a linear DSM and Italian MultiWordNet AUTHOR. Then, instead of measuring the associational scores between their subparts like in AUTHOR and AUTHOR, we exploited Distributional Semantics to observe how different the context vectors of our targets were from the vectors of their variants. Our proposal stemmed from the consideration that a high PMI value does not necessarily imply the idiomatic or multiword status of an expression, but just that its components co-occur more frequently than expected by chance, as in the case of read and book or solve and problem, which are all instances of compositional pairings. By contrast, what watertightly distinguishes an idiomatic from a collocation-like yet still compositional expression is their context of use. Comparing the distributional contexts of the original expressions and their alternatives should therefore represent a more precise refinement of the PMI-based procedure. Actually, idiomatic expressions vectors were found to be less similar to their variants vectors with respect to compositional expressions vectors. In some of our models, we also kept track of the variants that were not attested in our corpus by representing them as orthogonal vectors to the vector of the original expression, still achieving considerable results. Noteworthily, most researches conducted so far have focused on verbal idioms, while the analysis of NP idioms like red herring or second thoughts has been usually left aside.","In this contribution we applied to adjective-noun constructions the variant-based distributional measures we had previously tested on verbal idioms AUTHOR, obtaining effective performances. Interestingly, our measures performed comparably to or even better than the Additive method proposed in the distributional literature AUTHOR, while the Multiplicative one performed considerably worst than all our models, together with the Random baseline. Future work will concern testing whether these variant-based measures can be succesfully exploited to predict psycholinguistic data about the processing of idiom compositionality and flexibility, together with other corpus-based indices of idiomaticity.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We developed a Twitter Italian corpus annotated with a novel semantic annotation scheme for marking information not only about sentiment polarity, but also about the specific semantic areas/sub-topics which are the target of sentiment in the fertility-SWB domain. The relationship between big data and official statistics is increasingly a subject of attention AUTHOR. In this work we focus on Twitter data for two main reasons. First, Twitter individuals' opinions are posted spontaneously (not responding to a question) and often as a reaction to some emotional driven observation. Moreover, using Twitter we can incorporate additional measures of attitudes towards children and parenthood, with a wider geographical coverage than what is the case for traditional survey. Sentiment analysis in Twitter has been also used to monitor political sentiment AUTHOR, to extract critical information during times of mass emergency AUTHOR, or to analyse user stance in political debates on controversial topics AUTHOR. A comprehensive overview of sentiment analysis with annotated corpora is offered in AUTHOR. Focusing on Italian, among the existing resources we mention the Senti-TUT corpus AUTHOR and the TWITA corpus AUTHOR that were recently exploited in the SENTIment POLarity Classification (SENTIPOLC) shared task AUTHOR. The corpus described in this paper enriches the scenario of datasets available for Italian, enabling also a finer grained analysis of sentiment related phenomena in a novel domain related to parenthood and fertility.","The contribution of this paper is the exploration of opinions and semantic orientation about fertility and parenthood by scrutinizing about 3 million Italian tweets. This analysis is useful to identify features for the development of an automatic system to address automatic classification tasks in this domain. The corpus is available to the community. Its development constitutes a first step and a precondition to a further analysis that can be applied on such contents in order to extract, from semantically enriched data, measures of SWB constructed in an indirect way. This will hopefully improve our understanding of attitudes on fertility and parenthood. We are currently extending the corpus by exploring the very interesting debate around the ``Fertility Day's initiative"" from the Italy's Minister of Health Beatrice Lorenzin, which had a remarkable echo on social media such as Twitter, with a substantial number of (also sarcastic) messages with hashtag \#fertilityday posted.

The results obtained by the proposed system on standard datasets taken from the EVALITA campaigns show large accuracy improvements when compared with previous systems from the literature.,"In recent years there were a large number of works trying to push the accuracy of the PoS-tagging task forward using new techniques, mainly from the deep learning domain AUTHOR. All these studies are mainly devoted to show how to find the best combination of new neural network structures and character/word embeddings for reaching the highest classification performances, and typically present solutions that do not make any use of specific language resources (e.g. morphological analysers, gazetteers, guessing procedures for unknown words, etc.). This is, in general, a very desirable feature because it allows for the production of tools not tied to any specific language, but in various evaluation campaigns, at least for highly-inflected languages as Italian, the results showed quite clearly that this task would benefit from the use of specific and rich language resources AUTHOR.

However, despite being desiderata for linguistic analysis and language learning, as well as for training and evaluation of NLP tasks such as term extraction (and Machine Translation in multilingual scenarios), resources annotated with MWEs are a scarce commodity (Schneider et al., 2014b). The need for such types of resources is even greater for Italian, which does not benefit from the variety and volume of resources as does English. This paper outlines the development of a new language resource for Italian, namely a corpus annotated with Italian MWEs of a particular class: verb-noun expressions such as fare riferimento, dare luogo and prendere atto. Such collocations are reported to be the most frequent class of MWEs and of high practical importance both for automatic translation and language learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first resource of this kind in Italian. The development of this corpus is part of a multilingual project addressing the challenge of computational treatment of MWEs. It covers English, Spanish, Italian, and French and its goal is to develop a knowledge-poor methodology for automatically identifying MWEs and retrieving their translations (Taslimipoor et al., 2016) for any pair of languages. The developed methodology will be used for Machine Translation and multilingual dictionary compilation, and also in computer-aided tools to support the work of language learners and translators. Two versions of the above resource have been produced. The first version consists of lists of MWEs annotated out-of-context with a view to performing fast evaluation of the developed methodology (out-of-context mark-up). The second version consists of annotated MWEs along with their concordances (in-context annotation). The latter type of annotation is time-consuming, but provides the contexts for the MWEs annotated.","In this paper, we outline our work towards a gold-standard dataset which is tagged with Italian verb-noun MWEs along with their contexts. We show the reliability of this dataset by its considerable inter-annotator agreement compared to the moderate inter-annotator agreement on annotated verb-noun expressions presented without context. We also report the results of automatic extraction of MWEs using this dataset as a gold-standard. One of the advantages of this dataset is that it includes both 0-tagged and 1-tagged tokens of expressions and it can be used for classification and other statistical NLP approaches. In future work, we are interested in extracting context features from concordances in this resource to automatically recognise and classify the expressions that are MWEs in some contexts but not MWEs in others.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The outcome of this work is the SIMPITIKI corpus, which we make freely available, with pairs of sentences extracted from Wikipedia edits and annotated with simplification types. The resource contains also another corpus with roughly the same number of simplifications, which was manually created by simplifying documents in the administrative domain. %We also present some insight gained during corpus extraction and annotation, which could be useful to create similar simplification corpora for languages other than English.","In recent years, the shift of interest from rule-based to data-driven automated simplification has led to new research related to the creation of simplification corpora. These are parallel monolingual corpora, possibly aligned at sentence level, in which source and target are an original and a simplified version of the same sentence. This kind of corpora is needed both for training automatic simplification systems and for their evaluation. For English, several approaches have been evaluated based on the Parallel Wikipedia Simplification corpus AUTHOR, containing around 108,000 automatically aligned sentence pairs from cross-linked articles between Simple and Normal English Wikipedia. Although this resource has boosted research on data-driven simplification, it has some major drawbacks, for example its availability only in English, the fact that automatic alignment between Simple and Normal versions shows poor quality, and that only around 50\% of the sentence pairs correspond to real simplifications (according to a sample analysis performed on 200 pairs by AUTHOR). In this work, we present a study aimed at assessing the possibility to leverage a simplification corpus from Wikipedia in a semi-automated way, starting from Wikipedia edits. The study is inspired by the work presented in AUTHOR, in which a set of parallel sentences was extracted from Simple Wikipedia revision history. However, the present work is different in that: (i) we use the Italian Wikipedia revision history, demonstrating that the approach can be applied also to languages other than English and on edits of Wikipedia that were not created for educational purposes, and (ii) we manually select the actual simplifications and label them following the annotation scheme already applied to other Italian corpora. This makes possible the comparison with other resources for text simplification, and allows a seamless integration between different corpora. Our methodology can be summarised as follows: we first select the edited sentence pairs which were commented as `simplified' in Wikipedia edits, filtering out some specific simplification types (Section sect:ext). Then, we manually check the extracted pairs and, in case of simplification, we annotate the types in compliance with the existing annotation scheme for Italian (Section sect:pdf). Finally, we analyse the annotated pairs and compare their characteristics with the other corpora available for Italian (Section sec:anal).","We presented a study aimed at the extraction and annotation of a corpus for Italian text simplification based on Wikipedia. The work has highlighted the challenges and the advantages related to the use of Wikipedia edits. Our goal is to propose this resource as a testbed for the evaluation of Italian simplification systems, as an alternative to other existing corpora created in a more `controlled' setting. The corpus is made available to the research community together with the tools used to create it. The SIMPITIKI resource contains also a second corpus, of comparable size, which was created by manually simplifying a set of documents in the administrative domain. This allows cross-domain comparisons of simplification phenomena. In the future, this work can be extended in several directions. We plan to use the simplification pairs in this corpus to train a classifier with the goal of distinguishing between simplified and not-simplified pairs. This could extend the gold standard with a larger set of ``silver'' data by labelling all the remaining candidate pairs extracted from Wikipedia. Besides, the SIMPITIKI methodology is currently being used to create a similar corpus for Spanish, using the same annotation interface. The outcome of this effort will allow multilingual studies on simplification. %If this task can be performed with good accuracy, we further plan to perform a finer-grained classification and automatically label also the different simplification phenomena. Finally, we plan to evaluate the Ernesta system for Italian simplification AUTHOR using this corpus. Specifically, since different simplification phenomena are annotated, it would be interesting to perform a separate evaluation on each class, as suggested in AUTHOR. The research leading to this paper was partially supported by the EU Horizon 2020 Programme via the SIMPATICO Project (H2020-EURO-6-2015, n. 692819).",11,Text Simplification

The results achieved, although still preliminary, show the key role of factors such as the orientation of the relationship and the length of dependence in defining the various smudges of the same relationship.","Since the 1980s, the belief has been affirmed that methods and techniques developed within computational linguistics could help advance research by providing new evidence for the study of key notions of theoretical linguistics. ""Computational linguistics provides important potential tools for the testing of theoretical linguistic constructs and of their power to predict actual language use': this opens the contribution of AUTHOR, which based on the correlation between brandness and frequency proposes the results of an computational study of the notion of brandness at lexical and grammatical level conducted on the Brown corpus. While the evidence collected confirms the expected correlation between frequency and marking, interesting cases are recorded in which the statistical evidence from the Brown Corpus offers both greater problems and greater insight. [...] The frequency data is [...] the reverse of what one might have assumed under the markedness analysis'. Today, more than 40 years after AUTHOR's pionestic study, which was based on a morpho-syntactically noted corpus of about a million words, it is possible to extract accurate and varied linguistic information from the body of far greater dimensions. The increasing reliability of automatic language processing tools is making possible the acquisition of quantitative and computational evidence that spans through different levels of linguistic description, including the syntactical one, which can contribute significantly to the study of open questions of linguistic literature: AUTHOR represents an important example of this renewed line of studies. Within the framework outlined above, the objective of this contribution is to verify whether and to what extent algorithms for identifying the reliability and plausibility of syntactic annotation can contribute to the study of a linguistic phenomenon such as marking. With the increasingly widespread use of addiction syntactic annotations as a starting point for a wide range of applications aimed at extracting information from vast documentary collections, these algorithms arise from the need to identify within the automatically produced annotations the correct ones or, more simply, characterized by a greater degree of reliability and plausibility. This type of assessment can be carried out in relation to both the entire syntactic tree assigned to the single sentence (see Table 1). For example, AUTHOR and AUTHOR), both to the individual dependency relationship (see, among others, AUTHOR and AUTHOR). In this study, we will focus on the second type of algorithms, that is those that operate at the level of the single dependency relationship, to verify the potential in the study of the notion of linguistic brandness. Although these algorithms typically operate on AUTHOR's automatically recorded body, they are also used on body with manually validated annotation (qualified as ""gold'): in this case, the aim is to identify errors and inconsistencies of AUTHOR's annotation. The result of these algorithms varies from a binary classification of dependence (correct vs. wrong) as in AUTHOR, to a ordering of relationships according to the reliability and plausibility of the analysis, as proposed by AUTHOR. Beyond differences at the level of the algorithm used and the type of result, in all cases an extensive inventory of selected language characteristics as indicators of complexity is used.","In this study we have explored the hypothesis that algorithms developed to evaluate the reliability and plausibility of syntactic annotations with dependencies produced automatically can provide useful evidence for a reflection around the theme of syntactic complexity, and in particular to reconstruct 'smoothness' of increasing brandiness in relation to the same relationship of dependence. The first results achieved are encouraging: what has been observed in relation to the distribution of dependencies through the bands leads us to assume a strong correlation between the computational complexity of the analysis identified by LISCA and the notion of syntactic brandness. In particular, the role of factors such as relationship orientation and length of dependence has been investigated, with results clearly showing that an algorithm such as LISCA can also be a valid tool for linguistic analysis. Through the analysis of the distribution of dependency relationships in the bands defined on the basis of the order of LISCA it was possible not only to discriminate between marked and unmarked constructions (typically recoverable on the basis of frequency), but also to identify -- relationship by relationship -- the factors that contributed to making it marked. If the orientation of the relationship plays a crucial role in the case of amod, in the case of nsubj it is rather the distance between the head and the employee to determine the marking of the construction. Obviously, this analysis methodology should be extended to the wide range of language characteristics considered. The current developments of this work include: the extension, beyond the length and orientation of the relationship, of the type of linguistic factors explored, to arrive also at the study of the impact of lexical factors; the extension of the type of construction analysed, which could also include combinations of dependencies corresponding to syntactical sub-trees. We believe that the methodology should also be applied to treebanks of different languages, as well as different textual genres within the same language.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Secondly, we design a parse reranker based on Support Vector Machines using tree kernels, where the latter can effectively generalize syntactic patterns, requiring little training data for training the model. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art achieved by the Berkeley parser, improving it from 84.54 to 86.81 in labeled F1.","Constituency Syntactic parsing is one of the most important research lines in Computational Linguistics. Consequently, a large body of work has been also devoted to its design for Italian language AUTHOR. However, the accuracy reported for the best parser is still far behind the state of the art of other languages, e.g., English. One noticeable attempt to fill this technological gap was carried out in the EvalIta challenge, which proposed a parsing track on both dependency and constituency parsing for Italian. Among the several participant systems, the Berkeley parser AUTHOR gave the best result AUTHOR. At the beginning, the outcome for constituency parsing computed on TUT AUTHOR was much lower than the one obtained for English on the Penn Treebank AUTHOR. In the last EvalIta edition, such gap diminished as the Italian parser labeled F1 increased from 78.73% (EvalIta 2009) to 82.96% (EvalIta 2011). Some years later the parser F1 improved to 83.27% AUTHOR. However, the performance of the best English parser AUTHOR, i.e., 92.1%, is still far away. The main reason for such gap is the difference in the amount of training data available for Italian compared to English. In fact, while Penn Treebank contains 49,191 sentences/trees, TUT only contains 3,542 sentences/trees. In presence of scarcity of training data, a general solution for increasing the accuracy of a machine learning-based system is the use of more general features. This way, the probability of matching training and testing instance representations is larger, allowing the learning process to find more accurate optima. In case of syntactic parsing, we need to generalize either lexical or syntactic features, or possibly both. However, modeling such generalization in state-of-the-art parser algorithms such as the Bllip AUTHOR is rather challenging. In particular, the space of all possible syntactic patterns is very large and cannot be explicitly coded in the model. An easier solution consists in using such features in a simpler model, which can be trained to improve the outcome of the main parser, e.g., selecting one of its best hypotheses. In particular, tree kernels (TKs) by AUTHOR can be used for encoding an exponential number of syntactic patterns in parse rerankers. In this work, we aim at filling the gap between English and Italian constituency parsing: firstly, we adapted Bllip parser, i.e., the most accurate constituency parser for English, also known as Charniak parser, for Italian and trained it on TUT. We designed various configuration files for defining specific labels for TUT by also defining their type, although we did not encode head-finding rules for Italian, needed to complete the parser adaptation. Secondly, we apply rerankers based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using TKs to the k-best parses produced by Bllip, with the aim of selecting its best hypotheses. TKs allow us to represent data using the entire space of subtrees, which correspond to syntactic patterns of different level of generality. This representation enables the training of the reranker with little data. Finally, we tested our models on TUT, following the EvalIta setting and compare with other parsers. For example, we observed an improvement of about 2%, over the Berkeley parser, i.e., 86.81 vs. 84.54.","This work was inspired by AUTHOR and AUTHOR, who explored discriminative approaches for ranking problems. Their studies were limited to WSJ, though, and did not explore the use of max-margin classifiers, i.e., SVMs. The first experiments with SVMs and TKs were conducted by AUTHOR, who proposed a new SVM-based voting algorithm making use of preference reranking. In this paper, we adapted the Charniak parser for Italian gaining an improvement of 1.07\% over the Berkeley model (indicated by EvalIta as the state of the art for Italian). Then, our TK-based reranker further improved it up to 2 absolute percent points. It should also be noted that our best reranking result is 3.54 absolute points better than the best outcome reported in AUTHOR, i.e., 83.27. In the future, we would like to integrate (i) the features developed in the reranking software available by AUTHOR in our model for further improving it, (ii) generalizing lexical features (e.g., embeddings, brown clusters) and including similarity measures in PTK, i.e., SPTK AUTHOR.

In this work, we present LU4R - adaptive spoken Language Understanding 4 Robots, a Spoken Language Understanding chain for the semantic interpretation of robotic commands, that is sensitive to the operational environment. The system has been designed according to a Client/Server architecture in order to be easily integrated with the vast plethora of robotic platforms.","End-to-end communication in natural language between humans and robots is challenging for the different cognitive abilities involved during the interaction. As an example, for a robot to react to a command like ``take the book on the table'', a number of implicit assumptions should be met. First, at least two entities, book and a table, must exist in the environment and the speaker must be aware of such entities. Accordingly, the robot must have access to an inner representation of the objects, e.g., an explicit map of the environment. Second, mappings from lexical references to real world entities must be developed or made available. In this respect, the Grounding process AUTHOR links symbols (e.g., words) to the corresponding perceptual information. Hence, robot interactions need to be grounded, as meaning depends on the state of the physical world and the interpretation crucially interacts with perception, as pointed out by psycho-linguistic theories AUTHOR. To this end, the integration of perceptual information derived from the robot's sensors with an ontologically motivated description of the world has been adopted as an augmented representation of the environment, in the so-called semantic maps AUTHOR. In this maps, the existence of real world objects can be associated to lexical information, in the form of entity names given by a knowledge engineer or spoken by a user for a pointed object, as in Human-Augmented Mapping AUTHOR. While SLU for Interactive Robotics have been mostly carried out over the only evidences specific to the linguistic level (see, for example, AUTHOR), we argue that such process should be context-aware, in the sense that both the user and the robot access and make references to a shared environment. For example, in the above command, ``taking'' is the intended action whenever a book is actually on the table, so that ``the book on the table'' refers to a single argument. On the contrary, the command may refer to a ``bringing'' action, when no book is on the table and the book and on the table correspond to different semantic roles. In this paper, we present LU4R an adaptive spoken language understanding chain for the automatic interpretation of robotic spoken commands that is coherent with the above assumptions. The resulting chain is based on the approach proposed in AUTHOR that allows to produce interpretations that are consistent with (i) the world (with all the entities composing it), (ii) the Robotic Platform (with all its inner representations and capabilities), and (iii) the linguistic information derived from the user's utterance. LU4R is fully implemented in Java and is released according to a Client/Server architecture, in order to decouple the chain from the specific robotic platform that will use it. It receives as input one or more transcriptions of a spoken command and produces one or more linguistic predicates reflecting the actions intended by the user. Predicates, as well as their arguments, are consistent with a linguistically-motivated representation and coherent with the environment perceived by the robot. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section~sec:arch provides an architectural description of the entire system, as well as an overall introduction about its integration with a generic robot. In Section sec:exp we demonstrate the applicability of the chain in the interpretation of commands in English and Italian.","In this paper, we presented LU4R, an adaptive SLU processing chain focused on the interpretation of commands in the Mobile Service Robotics domain. The proposed solution relies on Frame Semantics and Distributional Lexical Semantics to support example-driven machine learning algorithms that map individual sentence transcriptions to meaningful commands. Statistical learning, i.e. \svmhmm, is applied by transforming the interpretation process into a cascade of sentence annotation tasks. The use of Frame semantics enables the reuse of large repositories of examples (i.e. AUTHOR), supporting the recognition of up to more than 1,000 different semantic frames, currently defined in the FrameNet database. The robustness of the sentence interpretation, as measured in this paper, is rather good, where language variability is tackled by relying on distributional lexical models that generalize semantics for large vocabularies, well beyond the training set dictionaries. Moreover, even though LU4R is completely decoupled from the Robotic Platform, the final interpretation is made dependent on the robot's environment, by designing perceptual knowledge through feature modeling. Perceptual knowledge is derived from the robot's semantic map and translated into feature values. The corresponding space allow to synthesize information about existence and position of named entities, useful to disambiguate predicates and role assignment. The results gathered during repeated empirical investigation campaigns confirm the effectiveness of the proposed tool and, in particular, the benefits provided by the injection of perceptual Knowledge into the understanding (i.e. labeling) process. LU4R is thus an effective example of grounded language learning framework, whereas predicates and semantic roles are acquired through an integration between linguistic (e.g. lexical and grammatical) properties and perceptual information (e.g. distances between entities in a map): this makes LU4R an interesting topic for future research, such as the extension of command interpretation process to complex interaction patterns, such as in interactive question answering or dialogue.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

This work is focused on developing new techniques that, leveraging a data driven approach, can help Human Resources to find a more precise employee satisfaction categorization, to easily identify possible issues and to act in a proactive fashion.","Every modern organization has a dedicated function which takes care of its employees, commonly called Human Resources (HR). HR duties are related to the capability of creating value through people, ensuring that everyone can express his own potential and has a productive and comfortable office environment. Nowadays, HR can rely on data to create a new paradigm based on a data driven approach, where analysts can leverage data in order to get more complete, detailed and data-supported decisions. Being able to monitor employees' engagement and satisfaction is critical in order to maintain a positive and constructive office environment. The benefit for the company is in the capability of retaining the best employees and keeping the overall workforce strong and motivated. Furthermore, recent surveys AUTHOR show the issues that companies are facing when they try to do retention or improve engagement. This paper is organized as follows. Section sec:rel_work presents a literature review on both themes of HR Management and text mining, Section sec:task_desc summarizes the motivations that drove the present study, Sections sec:exp_data and sec:model_desc discuss data and methodology, respectively, and Section sec:results presents the results.

Furthermore, it could help HR analysts to quickly decide which are the best actions to solve those issues, analyzing whether a complaint is isolated or shared by a group, whether it's trivial or urgent and act accordingly. As an example, HR Departments could test different actions over a group of unsatisfied employees, in order to understand which one is the most effective for a given issue. The very same model could also be used on neutral and positive subjects, so that HR could check whether the quality of life at work of these employees could be somehow improved, and understand which are the essential key factors for the employees' well-being.%, allowing the building of a positive working environment. From a technical point of view, one possible improvement in order to strengthen the solidity of the present approach could be to manually annotate a subset of (anonymized) texts, developing a gold standard of HR interview clusters, to be used as a test set for techniques like the one presented in this study. This gold standard may be made available company-wise, in order to encourage collaboration and to foster the creation of a data science community, to help bring a data driven way of thinking even to those areas which have been traditionally more reluctant to adopt a rigorous digital transformation. This is a first step to improve how HR Departments operate nowadays. We strongly believe that the introduction of a data driven approach can support critical HR decisional processes and improve companies' productivity, without having to sacrifice each individual's quality of life.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We compare the performance of our recursive Tree-LSTMs against other deep learning models: a recurrent version which considers a sequential connection between sentence elements, and a bag of words model which does not consider word ordering at all. We compare the approaches in an unsupervised similarity task in which general purpose embeddings should help to distinguish related content.","Word embeddings have succeeded in obtaining word semantics and projecting this information in a vector space. AUTHOR proposed two methodologies for learning semantic abstractions of words from large volumes of unlabelled data, Skipgram and CBOW, comprised in the word2vec framework. Another approach is GloVe AUTHOR, which learns from statistical co-occurrences of words. The two conceptually similar algorithms employ a sliding window of words, the context, with the intuition that words appearing frequently together are semantically related and thus should be represented closer in \mathbb{R}^n. The resulting vectors have shown strong correlation with human annotations in word-analogy tests AUTHOR. Despite the success of word embeddings in capturing semantic information, they cannot obtain on its own the composition of longer constructions, which is essential for natural language understanding. Thus, several methods using deep neural networks combine word vectors for obtaining sentence representations with linear mappings AUTHOR and deep neural networks, which make use of multiple network layers to obtain higher levels of abstraction AUTHOR. One of the first approaches of obtaining generic embeddings was Paragraph2Vec AUTHOR. Paragraph2Vec can learn unsupervised sentence representations, analogous to word2vec models for word representation, by adding an extra node, indicating the document contribution, to the model. Attending to the way the nodes of the network link with each other, two approaches are frequent in NLP: recurrent neural networks and recursive neural networks (RNN)~.}. Recurrent models consider sequential links among words, while recursive models use graph-like structures for organizing the network operations. They process neighbouring words by parsing the tree order (dependency or syntactic graphs), and compute node representations for each parent recursively from the previous step until they reach the root of the tree, which gives the final sentence abstraction. In this work, we train a variant of Tree-LSTM models for learning concept abstractions with dictionary descriptions as an input. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to embed dictionaries using such approach. Our model takes complex graph-like structures (e.g. syntactic or dependency graphs) as opposed to the most common approaches which employ recurrent models or unordered distributions of words as representation of the sentences. We use an unsupervised similarity benchmark with the intuition that better sentence embeddings will produce more coincidences with human annotations (comparably to the word analogy task in word embeddings).","The DictRep BoW model was undeniably better than the recurrent and recursive models achieving the best position in all cases (Table similarity-table). The TreeDict-Dep model ranked second. All models capture the correlations with human annotations better in neutral contexts. If there are contradictions and entailment relationships, the agreement with human annotations is less evident. Nevertheless, this behaviour is expected and also desirable, as this is an unsupervised benchmark and the system has no way of learning a similar but conflicting relationship without external help. It is clear that BoW models offered the best performance in all the datasets. The Tree-LSTM model, which is consistently better than the sequential models, ranked second. Table corrmodel-table shows the correlation among models over the SICK similarity dataset. All the models experience strong cross-correlations between them but the Tree-LSTM with dependency parsing showed the closest correlation with the BoW and recurrent models. The Table polarity-table shows the performance of the models in the supervised polarity tasks. BoW and SkipThoughts models experience similar outcomes for the 5 and 3 label task. Models trained with dictionary definitions (DictRep and TreeDict) lag behind those models. However, all the networks using dependency structures have consistently beaten its sequential counterparts. This is a strong indicative of the benefits of using this more complex network structure. The difference between the different network configurations of the same model are less pronounced that in the similarity tasks but in our tests, the models that used the extra link backwards achieved small gains (at least in the 3-label task). In previous work, AUTHOR compared other models in this same similarity benchmark achieving comparable results. Not only DictRep-BoW models outperformed the DictRep-RNNs but also the Skip-thought model, which considers the order of the words in a sentence, was beaten by FastSent, its counterpart that employs BoW representation of a sentence. The effect of word orderings is not clear. BoW models are far from being ideal as they cannot obtain which parts are negated or the dependencies among the different elements of the sentence (e.g. the black dog chases the white cat and the black cat chases the white dog cannot be differentiated by only using BoW models). It is important to mention that the similarity was tested only at the root node when using Tree-LSTM. Notwithstanding, recursive models allow to use more elaborated strategies, taking advantage of the dependencies used to build the relationships of the nodes in the deep network. These strategies could combine similarities at different levels of the sentence to obtain a more approximate value of similarity (e.g. using a pooling matrix with all the nodes of the parse tree AUTHOR). The errors during training time in held-out data were 0.57 for BoW models versus the 0.51 achieved by recurrent and recursive models. Nevertheless, better dictionary embeddings do not seem to directly translate into better performance at inferring general purpose sentence embeddings in the benchmarks. Results in the test also show that we need better mechanisms to infer sentence level representations. In this paper we introduced the use of recursive models for the generation of general purpose embeddings once they are trained by embedding dictionary definitions. We compare recurrent and recursive models in the embedding dictionary task and we test the validity of these embeddings for their use as general purpose codification of sentences with both similarity. Results demonstrate slight advantages of the Tree recursive variant over recurrent models that learn from dictionaries, which are more frequently employed. Recursive models are more expensive computationally and have a more complex implementation but they exhibit better performance in longer sentences. However, with current learning techniques recurrent and recursive models cannot offer better results than simpler models such as BoW representations of sentences in unsupervised similarity benchmarks. The results of these findings shall be confirmed in the future in more complex scenarios, such as large scale QA.",22,Distributional Semantics

Once the information is organized in a complete bilingual database, it can assist translation and conclusions can be drawn regarding connective distribution, sense distribution and ambiguity in the different languages.

To date, 105 non-native speakers – whose mother tongues are either French, Romanian, Spanish, English, German, or Russian – have been recorded. The corpus includes also a control group made up of 16 Italian speakers. There are almost 8 hours of audio material, both read speech (first and second reading), and spontaneous speech. This paper emphasizes the necessity for this type of database, it describes the steps involved in its construction, and it presents the features of CorAIt.","It has become clear that accurately designed speech corpora are of essential importance for the development of efficient speech technologies. Investigating how native and foreign-accented speech differ is a necessary step in non-native speech recognition AUTHOR. Currently, the number of non-native speech databases seems almost insignificant if compared to corpora of native speech. Moreover, until recently, the majority of the research has focused on English. Therefore, some of the largest non-native speech databases are available for this language: TED AUTHOR, Duke-Arslan AUTHOR, ISLE AUTHOR, IBM-Fisher AUTHOR, ATR-Gruhn AUTHOR, CSLU AUTHOR, NATO M-ATC AUTHOR, and Speech Accent Archive AUTHOR. Large speech corpora of foreign-accented English are owned by Speechocean, and they are specifically built for commercial purposes, especially for training and testing speech recognizers, but some of them are also available for academic research on the KilingLine Data Center platform AUTHOR. Only in the last few years has there been an interest in other languages. Without claiming to be exhaustive, some of the largest non-native speech databases for languages other than English will be mentioned: BAS Strange I+II AUTHOR for German, WP Russian AUTHOR for Russian, Tokyo-Kikuko AUTHOR for Japanese, TC-STAR AUTHOR and WP Spanish AUTHOR for Spanish, SINOD AUTHOR for Slovenian, and iCALL AUTHOR for Chinese. However, as a result of that fact that many nonnative speech databases are built for commercial purposes within private research centres, it is actually quite difficult to map all the resources of this type ever built (Cf. AUTHOR, for an overview of the non-native speech databases available at the date their study was published). This paper presents CorAIt, a non-native speech database for Italian. The database is part of a Ph.D. project which intends to study foreign accented Italian speech both from a computational perspective (automatic identification and classification of non-native accent) and a perceptual perspective (interpretation of quantitative and qualitative judgments delivered by expert and naïve native Italian speakers with respect to non-native pronunciations). The design and the development of this corpus were determined by several factors, which are outlined below.","Considering that currently this non-native speech database presents some imbalance issues as regards the speakers’ age of Italian language onset, their proficiency level, as well as the length of their residence in Italy, the data collection will be further extended. In the future, the web database might also be enhanced with orthographic and phonetic transcriptions. Disfluencies (i.e. false starts, filled and silent pauses, phoneme lengthening, mispronounced words), mouth clicks, and external noise could be annotated.",13,Multimodal

This wealth, especially in terms of information on morphological, semantic and syntactic characteristics almost absent in other available research tools, makes the database particularly useful to prepare lists of adequately balanced stimuli for factorial experiments in all areas of research where words can be used as stimuli.

Such behavior could indicate a propensity, in contemporary Italian, for a clear separation between the functions carried out by the two Aux. Alternatively, preference can be assumed for the creation of V inergatives, over the indictments. As mentioned above (§1.1 and §2.4), this analysis wanted to investigate mainly quantitative aspects, therefore it will necessarily be expanded to determine what are, if any, the reasons for the data found. In particular, the hypotheses concerning the semantic aspect of VNeo will be investigated. An analysis focused on the semantics of the neologisms studied could be useful, in fact, to show any trends in the creation of new verbs (in terms of semantic and/or visual preferences). A further field of investigation worthy of further investigation could be that relating to the values and functions carried out by the past participle in conjunction with the Aux being. Despite the limitations of a broad but subtle notion of neologism and the use of a vast corpus but relative representativeness, the work offers quantitatively clear data confirming the importance of resources such as corporations for the advancement of lexicographic studies (and not only).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The work is performed through the combined use of a morphological analyser for Latin (Lemlat), and a database collecting all word forms occurring through different periods of Latin language (TF-CILF).","The investigation of lexical data of Classical languages through the use of linguistic resources and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools has witnessed a surge of interest in the past decade. As far as Latin is concerned, today several textual and lexical resources, as well as NLP tools, are being used in lexicographic research., AUTHOR, AUTHOR and AUTHOR.} One of the bedrocks of this type of research is the use of morphological analysers, that is, tools that, given an input word form, output its corresponding lemma(s) and morphological features. First released at the beginning of the 1990s and recently made freely available in its version 3.0 AUTHOR, Lemlat is one of the best performing morphological analysers and lemmatisers for Latin.. See AUTHOR for a comparative evaluation of the morphological analysers currently available for Latin. Lemlat is currently in the process of being enriched with all lemmas contained in the glossary of Medieval Latin Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis compiled by Charles Du Cange et alii in 1883-1887 AUTHOR. One of the first groups of lemmas from Du Cange which was included into the lexical basis of Lemlat was that collecting all 3\textsuperscript{rd} declension nouns ending in \mbox{-io}, one of the most productive affixes in all periods of Latin, up to Romance languages AUTHOR. The aim of this study is to perform a diachronic quantitative evaluation of 3\textsuperscript{rd} declension nouns ending in \mbox{-io}. To do so, first we use Lemlat to lemmatise all word forms of such nouns contained in Thesaurus formarum totius latinitatis a Plauto usque ad saeculum XXum (TF-CILF) AUTHOR. Then we evaluate the results of the lemmatisation in both quantitative and qualitative terms.","In this paper, we presented a study of the diachronic distribution of Latin nouns ending in \mbox{-io} by processing word forms from the TF-CILF corpus with the morphological analyser Lemlat. We demonstrated that the \mbox{-io} suffix is very productive across all periods of Latin language, showing a particularly high frequency in both Medieval and Neo-Latin texts. Ratio remains always the most used \mbox{-io} noun across the entire diachronic span covered by the corpus used in our work. One step further in the study of \mbox{-io} nouns would be to establish derivational relationships for each lemma and to verify which of the two lexical groups (Lemlat or Du Cange) the input lemma belongs to. Also, an evaluation of the unknown word forms after the lemmatisation process should be performed. Given the wide lexical coverage provided by Lemlat, our work represents a positive example of how much NLP tools can help to investigate diachronic aspects of language. %However, if this holds true when dealing with basic levels of linguistic analysis (like lemmatisation and PoS tagging), things become trickier when syntactic parsing is concerned. In this respect, Ponti and Passarotti (2016) show the dramatic drop of the accuracy rates of a dependency parser trained on a Medieval Latin treebank when applied to Classical Latin texts. The wide diachronic as well as diatopic span over which Latin texts are spread opens an appealing challenge for research in NLP, which has to address the problem of portability of NLP tools across time, place and genre. In this sense, Latin texts represent a perfect dataset both for developing and for evaluating techniques of domain-adaptation of NLP tools.",5,Latin Resources
191_2017,2017,paper014/chesi-2017-CLiC.docx,Cristiano Chesi,Phase-based Minimalist Parsing and complexity in non-local dependencies,ENG,1,0,0,IUSS,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pavia,"A cognitively plausible parsing algorithm should perform like the human parser in critical contexts. Here I propose an adaptation of Earley’s parsing algorithm, suitable for Phase-based Minimalist Grammars AUTHOR, that is able to predict complexity effects in performance. Focusing on self-paced reading experiments of object clefts sentences AUTHOR I will associate to parsing a complexity metric based on cued features to be retrieved at the verb segment (Feature Retrieval & Encoding Cost, FREC). FREC is crucially based on the usage of memory predicted by the discussed parsing algorithm and it correctly fits with the reading time revealed.","The last twenty years of formal linguistic research have been deeply influenced by Chomsky’s minimalist intuitions (Chomsky 1995, 2013). In a nutshell, the core Minimalist proposal is to reduce phrase structure formation to the recursive application of a binary, bottom-up, structure-building operation dubbed Merge. Merge creates hierarchical structures by combining two lexical items (1.a), one lexical item and an already built (by previous application of Merge operations) phrase (1.b) or two already built phrases (1.c). Phrases are not linearly ordered by Merge. Only when they are spelled-out (i.e. sent to the SensoryMotor interface, aka Phonetic Form, PF), linearization is required: assuming that x and y are terminal nodes (i.e. words), either <x, y> or <y, x> can both be proper linearizations of (1.a). Hierarchical structure (and linearization) is also determined by another structure building operation: Move (or Internal Merge, Chomsky 1995); Move re-arranges phrases in the structure by re-merging an item (already merged in the structure) to the edge of the current, top-most, phrase: for instance [XP [YP [ZP]]] can lead to [ZP [XP [YP (ZP)]] if XP (the probe) has a feature triggering movement (e.g. +f) and ZP (the goal) has the relevant feature qualifying it as a plausible target for movement (e.g. -f). At the end, the element displaced (ZP) will occupy the edge of the structure. When the items within an already built phrase, for instance XP, are delivered to PF, they get properly linearized according to their hierarchical structure (e.g. Linear Correspondence Axiom, Kayne 1994), intrinsic phonetic properties (e.g. cliticization), as well as economy conditions (e.g. an items should not be pronounced twice). Such a (cyclic) spellout happens at phases: XP will be delivered to PF only if it qualifies as a phase (Chomsky 2013). In this sense, a phase should be a constituent/phrase with some degree of completeness with respect to semantic interpretation (Logic Form, aka LF). Most minimalist linguists agree on the fact that a full-fledged sentence (aka Complementizer Phrase, CP) is a phase, the highest argumental shell of a predicate qualifies as a phase (aka littlev Phrase, vP) and also a full argument is a phase (aka Determiner Phrase, DP). Such a simple (and computationally appealing) model has been fully formalized (Stabler 1997, Collins & Stabler 2016) and some parsing algorithm that implements main minimalist insights has been discussed in literature (e.g. Harkema 2001, Chesi 2012 a.o.). In these pages, I will present some of the advantages of retaining such a simplified computational approach to syntactic derivation. Crucially, I will try to overcome some clear disadvantages in assuming the just presented standard, bottom-up, structure building operations, while obtaining, at the same time, a better empirical fit: on the one hand, I will avoid any non-efficient deductiveparsing perspective (that is a consequence of the assumed bottom-up nature of the Merge and Move operations); on the other, I will promote a more transparent relation between formal competence, parsing and psycholinguistic performance by presenting a simple adaptation of Earley’s Top-Down parsing algorithm (Earley 1970) and a complexity metric that refers directly to parsing memory usage: this metric will be able to account for complexity in retrieving the correct item while processing specific non-local dependencies. By “non-local” dependencies I refer to those relations involving movement, namely constructions where the very same item occurs in two distinct, non-adjacent, positions: for instance, wh-dependencies in English require the whitem (who, in (1)) to be interpreted both in a the left peripheral (focalized) position (the Criterial position, in the sense of Rizzi 2007) and in the thematic lower position (right next to the verb meet in (1))1: (1) Who1 do you think Mary will meet _1? The critical derivation I will discuss in this paper is that of object clefts (Gordon et al. 2001) that with wh-questions share a similar non-local dependency formation: (2) a. It is [DP1 the banker|John|me] that [DP2 the lawyer|Dan|you] will meet _DP1 In short, the head of the dependency (DP1) should be interpreted both as a focalized item and as the direct object (this is where the name of the construction “object cleft” comes from) of the embedded verb. The difficulty of parsing this structure has been deeply discussed in literature (Gordon et al. 2004). What is considered a crucial factor is the role of the similarity between DP1 and DP2 (the subject of the cleft, Belletti and Rizzi 2013, §2). To capture this fact, I will re-adapt Earley’s algorithm (§3.1) to operate on a specific version of Minimalist Grammar (§3). This would allow us to subsume the similarity effect by predicting reading differences as revealed in self-paced reading experiments (e.g. Warren & Gibson 2005, §4).","In this paper I presented an adaptation of Earley’s Top-Down parsing algorithm to be used with a simple implementation of a Minimalist Grammar (PMG). The advantages of this approach are both in terms of cognitive plausibility and parsing/performance transparency. From the cognitive plausibility perspective, I showed how a re-orientation of the minimalist structure building operations Merge and Move is sufficient to include such operations directly within a parsing procedure. This is a step toward the “Parser Is the Grammar” (PIG) default hypothesis (Phillips 2006) and a welcome simplification of the linguistic competence description: such a grammar description (i.e. our linguistic competence) is shared both in production (generation) and in comprehension (parsing); this seems trivial from a cognitive perspective (we have a unique Broca’s area activated in syntactic processing both in parsing and in generation), but it is far from trivial in computational terms. On the other hand, from the parsing/performance transparency perspective, I presented a complexity metric (FREC), based on cued features stored in memory which better characterize performance in object clefts constructions compared to alternative models: for instance the Depencency Locality Theory (DLT) based on accessibility hierarchy (Gibson 2000) is unable to predict high complexity in N-N condition comparable to N-D or D-D condition, since N should be uniformly more accessible than D, contrary to the facts. The proposed model, obviously should be extended in many respects to capture other critical phenomena (see Lewis & Vasishth 2005) but the first results on specific well-studied constructions, like object clefts, seem very promising.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

That is to say, `news is not simply that which happens, but that which can be regarded and presented as newsworthy' AUTHOR. Galtung and Ruge AUTHOR identify a list of factors that an event should satisfy to become news; in other words, the likelihood of an event being considered newsworthy increases with the number of factors it complies with. The newsworthiness factors reflect a set of values and provide a certain representation of the world AUTHOR. This representation and the corresponding values are constructed and encoded in the language used in the news. For this reason, each particular linguistic form or stylistic variation can be motivated by the purpose of representing a certain value. According to Labov's axiom AUTHOR, style ranges along a single dimension, namely the attention paid to speech. Bell AUTHOR refutes this axiom, stating that style can be considered also as a response to other factors. These factors constitute a new dimension of stylistic variation, that, in headlines, might be related to the necessity of reflecting newsworthy factors, and meeting two needs: attracting users’ attention and summarizing contents AUTHOR. This paper aims to provide a preliminary analysis of the linguistic features in news headlines and how these relate to specific newsworthiness categories. The analysis rests on the hypothesis that each particular linguistic form or stylistic variation can be motivated by the purpose of encoding a certain newsworthy value.

In fact, popular films have the power to sway our collective imagination and influence our attitudes on crucial issues related to race, class, gender, etc. Characters in films reflect and perpetuate the status and options of them in today’s society and culture, and thus play an active part in creating symbolic role models (Kord 2005, Bednarek 2015). Accordingly, it is interesting to examine the ways in which both females and males are represented on celluloid to better understand the ideologies they bear, and how gender identities are idealized. There seems to be wide agreement on the fact that characterization in filmic discourse heavily relies on archetypes and simplification AUTHOR. This is especially true in gender representation, as stereotypical roles simplify characterization in a way that it is easier to be received by the viewing audience. This, however, often results in an extreme polarization of gender roles. Film dialogues are therefore an ideal ground on which to study gender stereotypes and their linguistic representation and reception. Hence, this paper aims to fathom the discursive representation and the perception of well-established gender stereotypes in the dialogues of a sample of cult British and American romantic comedies, by integrating the tools of discourse analysis, corpus linguistics and perception analysis.","The present paper proposes an original take on investigating gender stereotypes in language. The novelty in our approach lies in the hybrid methodology that falls neither in the tradition of the literature on “gendered discourse” nor in the more recent field of corpus linguistics, but combines the two and adds insights from psycholinguistics as well. This kind of integrated analysis provided us with preliminary results that help identify gender archetypical roles, behaviours and linguistic representations in modern western culture. What is interesting to note is that the gender representations coming to light from our corpus of pop-culture films are based on features that are now dismissed as clichéd and stereotypical by the literature AUTHOR, but which seem to be nonetheless entrenched in our interpretation of reality. The archetypical depiction of characters is particularly evident in popular comedies, which do not examine characters’ psychology in depth. The test validated our assumption that film language stereotypically portrays the way in which men and women talk drawing on recognisable traits attached to femininity and masculinity in our culture. In fact, speakers were mostly able to correctly assign the utterances to the right gender. In addition, all our informants showed metalinguistic –or second-level –awareness about stereotypical concepts and linguistic clues, and several of them also provided us with insightful and creative inferences based on the event described in the utterance. We interpret this as a sign of stereotypes being conceptual in nature, deeply entrenched in our representation of the world and accessed via linguistic clues. The “reverse stereotypes” also reinforce this idea.",21,Gender and Inclusive Language Studies

Metadata for drama describe the dramatic qualities of a text, connecting them with the linguistic expressions. Relying on an ontological representation of the dramatic qualities, the paper presents a proposal for the creation of a corpus of annotated dramatic texts.","Drama annotation is the process of annotating the metadata of a drama. Given a drama expressed in some medium (text for screenplays, audiovisual for cinema, interactive multimedia for videogames, etc., termed by Esslin ``dramatic media'', i.e. media that display characters performing actions): the process of metadata annotation identifies what are the elements that characterize the drama and annotates such elements in some metadata format. For example, in the sentence ``Laertes and Polonius warn Ophelia to stay away from Hamlet.'', the word ``Laertes'', which refers to a drama element, namely a character, will be annotated as ``Character'', taken from some set of metadata. Drama annotation projects, with the sets of metadata and annotations proposed in the scientific literature, rely upon markup languages and semantic encoding. Recently, there have been many approaches to the annotation of stories (a larger set than drama, including general narrative, not exclusively conveyed by characters performing actions). Annotations are going to enrich drama documents with appropriate metadata. Most of the approaches, e.g., the Story Workbench tool AUTHOR and the DramaBank project AUTHOR, build upon the linguistic expression of the story, typically some natural language, and annotate story elements, such as characters and conflicts, over the linguistic layer of part-of-speech tagging and verbal frames. Other approaches are more detached from the linguistic expression: they consider the cultural object of the story and rely on conceptual models encoded in logic frameworks, e.g., the Contextus Project, visited on 7 July 2017.}, the StorySpace ontology AUTHOR. However, most projects work in an isolated fashion: each approach provides its own annotation schema, without connection with the general knowledge, and do not provide the annotated documents with a clear status. This paper presents an overview of the Drammar approach for the metadata annotation of dramatic texts: the gathering of such corpus is relevant for teaching drama through schematic charts AUTHOR, informing models of automatic storytelling AUTHOR, preserving drama as an intangible form of cultural heritage AUTHOR. We shortly review the current approaches, before introducing the Drammar ontology underlying the annotation schema.

195_2017,2017,paper019/Laudanna_Bracco_clic.docx,"Alessandro Laudanna, Giulia Bracco",Stem and fragment priming on verbal forms of Italian,ENG,2,1,0,Università di Salerno,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Salerno,"In this paper we investigate the respective roles of orthographic and morphological structure in the processing of Italian verbal forms by using the masked priming paradigm. According to the morphology-based view, in a priming condition the recognition of an inflected word should be facilitated by the presentation of the stem. The cohort model, instead, postulates that the orthographic material from the word’s onset to the uniqueness point should be sufficient for the activation of the morphological family.","According to the cohort models of visual word recognition AUTHOR, all the sources of information that contribute to the identification of a target word proceed from left to right: a single word of the cohort becomes unique at the uniqueness point, when it remains the only candidate corresponding to the orthographic configuration of the stimulus. At that point the recognition takes place. Cohort models use the neighborhood size and the frequency distribution of neighbors as predictors of the competition between candidates and of the consequent recognition latencies. The same models not always deal with the internal morphological structure of the word (but see AUTHOR). In Italian, verbal families have orthographically similar members, but these words often become ‘unique’ only at the end, since information about mood, tense and number is carried by affixes in the final part of the word. The N-count is not the best measure to describe their relatedness. On the other hand, morphological parsing accounts (e.g., AUTHOR;AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR) support the argument that the stem is the key of access to the lexicon. Morphological priming shows that, even though morphologically related pairs share some orthographic material (verbs sharing the stem also share letters in initial position, unless they are prefixed), the role played by the morphological structure is different from the one played by the orthographic structure AUTHOR. In the following experiments, we used the priming paradigm to preactivate both the morphological and the orthographic keys of access. Many studies employing the priming paradigm used an orthographically similar baseline, while others (e.g., AUTHOR; AUTHOR) employed orthographically and morphologically dissimilar baselines, and others, finally, (AUTHOR; AUTHOR) estimated morphological facilitation in comparison with both types of baselines. To our knowledge, no study employed the stem priming in Italian, by using both an orthographic and a morphological baseline. We use the term ‘stem’ to denote the residual part of the word when all inflectional affixes are removed and that can, or cannot be, complex. In contrast, the root is not analysable AUTHOR. The stem does not end in a vowel, and if presented in isolation, it appears as an incomplete word, an orthographic fragment, even if it carries lexical information. By this token, this feature could also turn out to be a benefit: studies employing the priming paradigm usually have to deal with the objection that the base form is a word. The stem primes provide an abstract lexical information in a non-lexicalized form. In order to ascertain if the initial string of letters up to the uniqueness point is the orthographic access code, in Experiment 1 we used Italian verbs with the uniqueness point occurring before the stem (e.g., ‘ABBAN’ is a fragment present only in the morphological family of ‘abbandonare’, to abandon. All the words starting with the fragment ‘ABBAN’ (e.g. ‘abbandonai’, I abandoned, ‘abbandonato’, abandoned) belong to the same morphological family). Then, in Experiment 2, we started from the consideration that, when the initial fragment before the stem is shared by more than one family, only a non homographic stem is the true ‘uniqueness point’: we used verbal forms with the uniqueness point only at the stem boundary (e.g., the fragment ‘DISTRI’ is shared by two morphological families: ‘distribuire’, to distribute, and ‘districare’, to unravel, whose stems, ‘DISTRIB’ and ‘DISTRIC’, respectively, have no homograph). The masked priming paradigm was used in order to avoid intuitions or response strategies in participants (AUTHOR; AUTHOR): this technique avoids the overt detection of any relation between prime and target. Moreover, it has been argued that lexical decision latencies associated with masked priming also reflect the organization of the lexicon in the mind, rather than representing the mechanisms directly involved during single words access AUTHOR. In Experiment 2 cohorts defined by the fragment and by the stem had different frequency distribution, with fragments matching the initial part of lower or higher frequency morphological families. By this token, on the one hand we expected to detect the morphological vs. orthographic nature of the key(s) of access to the lexicon; on the other hand, we indirectly tested the stem frequency effect.","Results of Experiment 1 show that when orthographic information about initial part of the word is exhaustive, it is as reliable as stem priming, and these results are difficult to reconcile with the morphologicallybased view which postulates that the stem is critical for lexical access. In addition, the ‘relative frequency’ effect (Experiment2), which arises in Stem Condition, suggests that, during recognition, when a low frequency word shares the stem with higher frequency members, it is disadvantaged. In order to gain lexical access, the word has to sustain a harder competition with other members according to their frequency distribution in the morphological family. This effect has been largely described for orthographic neighborhood AUTHOR, but, again, it is difficult to reconcile with the stem frequency effect AUTHOR which states the opposite, with cumulative frequency of morphologically related words facilitating the recognition of a low frequency word. These results are in line with previous data on Italian, which failed in replicating root frequency effects AUTHOR. Root morpheme frequency effects are crucial in the general issue of whether words are accessed through decomposition rather than as full forms, since it has been widely used as the strongest evidence in favor of the hypothesis of the root morpheme representation. Nevertheless, the morphological parsing account is not the unique explanation for root frequency effects: also full listing models (see AUTHOR) can provide a general outline in which this effect is explained, for instance, in terms of lexical connections. This view has been inspected also in linguistics: AUTHOR proposed that the activation level of a word is the result of lexical connections and lexical strength, with the first one determined by the frequency of the lexical item, and lexical connections corresponding to the pattern of weight connections associated with the links between related items. For high frequency words the individual lexical strength is elevated; low frequency words have a weak lexical activation and need the support of the activation of lexical connections. This theory is consistent with the claim that whole word frequency effects arise over a precise threshold AUTHOR. If the measure for these connections is the stem frequency, the more frequent the stem, the faster the recognition (AUTHOR, AUTHOR, AUTHOR). AUTHOR found that the relative frequency of family members affects the recognition of auditory stimuli: words with high-frequency suffixed candidates derived from the same stem were recognized more slowly than words with morphological family members of a lower frequency. The effects discussed in this paper are also consistent with previous data on stem priming and the “relative frequency” effect in Italian AUTHOR, suggesting that the relations between words in the paradigm need to be taken into account, even if we maintain that whole word representations are the keys for lexical access. In summary, the results presented in this paper about the processing of Italian verbal forms suggest that it is performed sequentially and it proceeds from left-to-right. Morphological structure does not play a deterministic role, and recognition is guided by the information carried by the initial part of the word, whether it matches a morpheme or not. Priming induced by ‘unique’ fragments is as reliable as stem priming. In addition, stem priming is not explainable in terms of a stem frequency effect. Furthermore, the observation of a ‘relative frequency’ rather than a ‘stem frequency’ effect, suggests that we are tapping into a phenomenon concerning connections among whole words.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

This has been necessary, considering the poor performances of out-of-the-box Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) tools tested in the initial phase of this work.","Current NLP techniques allow us to treat some types of historical textual resources provided by, among others, historical archives and libraries, as a source of information (and, in prospect, of knowledge) for automatic systems. Besides encyclopedic resources, libraries and archives provide many different types of texts, often spanning very specific geographical, individual or thematic contexts, for which current knowledge extraction systems may lack the suitable information. Nevertheless, the tasks of extracting, disambiguating and linking information provided by historical textual documents with respect to external knowledge bases is still a crucial step towards automatic access to written resources and for further employ of such knowledge in end-user applications (e.g. navigation, rich semantic search, creation of narrative chains). In order to address longer term tasks, such as event extraction from historical texts AUTHOR, we first addressed the task of extracting and disambiguating Named Entities (Persons, Locations and Organizations) from a corpus of historical memories of the \enquote{Liberation War} in Italy, during the Second World War. Due to the specificity of the domain and of the involved entities, state-of-the-art tools for Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation show low performances, thus suggesting us to try to achieve our goal using a different approach.

The PARSEME-It VMWE corpus has been developed by the PARSEME-IT research group in the framework of the PARSEME Shared Task on Automatic Identification of Verbal Multiword Expressions AUTHOR, a joint effort, carried out within a European research network, to elaborate universal terminologies and annotation guidelines for verbal multiword expressions in 18 languages, among which also the Italian language is represented. Notably, multiword expressions represent a difficult lexical construction to identify, model and treat by Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, such as parsers, machine translation engines among others, mainly due to their non-compositional property. In particular, among multiword expressions verbal ones are particularly challenging because they have different syntactic structures (prendere una decisione 'make a decision', decisioni prese precedentemente 'decisions made previously'), may be continuous and discontinuous (andare e venire versus andare in malora in Luigi ha fatto andare la societ\`a in malora), may have a literal and figurative meaning (abboccare all'amo 'bite the hook' or 'be deceived').

We propose an approach that can detect specific emotions from positive, neutral and negative sentiments and which favors the tweets that occur at recent sentiment spikes. Our results suggest that our approach can effectively detect joy, neutral and anger emotions and that it performs better compared to the baselines.","Recent years have seen the emergence of social media that enable people to share their thoughts and opinions in an easy and fast way. Opinions posted on social media are very useful to understand what people think and how they feel about a specific entity (e.g. a product, a person, a company etc.). For example, companies can mine users' opinions on a product that has just been released to understand if the users are satisfied or not and act accordingly. Therefore, the automatic detection of emotions and sentiments from text has attracted a lot of research interest AUTHOR. Although sentiment and emotion analysis share some similarities, they are two different problems AUTHOR. Sentiment analysis focuses on understanding the sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, negative) of a text AUTHOR whereas emotion analysis refers to its affectual attitude such as anger, joy, fear etc. AUTHOR. Most of the previous work have tried to predict sentiments from data annotated with sentiments and emotions from data annotated with emotions. However, preliminary experiments showed that some emotions are related to sentiments. Specifically, negative sentiment is related to anger, positive sentiment to joy and text with no emotion (neutral emotion) to text with no sentiment (neutral sentiment). In addition, public sentiment towards a specific entity changes over time and in some cases sentiment spikes may occur. Sentiment spikes occur when a large amount of documents of a specific sentiment is posted AUTHOR. The documents that occur at sentiment spikes usually refer to a topic or event that attracted a lot of attention and therefore they can be very helpful for sentiment and emotion analysis. To this end, in this study we propose to incorporate information from the documents that have occurred at sentiment spikes to improve the performance of the emotion analysis task. In this paper, we focus on Twitter and we propose the emerging Sentiment Language Model (emerging-SLM) approach which favors tweets that occur at recent sentiment spikes with the aim to predict joy, anger and neutral emotions from positive, negative and neutral sentiments respectively. We test our approach on a collection of tweets that spans over nine days and we show that the emerging-SLM performs better compared to both state-of-art Sentiment Language Model (SLM) and to a random Sentiment Language Model (random-SLM).","In this paper, we proposed the emerging-SLM approach to detect joy, neutral and anger emotions from positive, neutral and negative sentiments respectively.

Besides, we describe how a freely available system can be tuned to cover also the simplification of phrases, and perform an evaluation comparing different experimental settings.","Lexical simplification is a well-studied topic within the NLP community, dealing with the automatic replacement of complex terms with simpler ones in a sentence, in order to improve its clarity and readability. Thanks to the development of benchmarks AUTHOR and freely available tools for lexical simplification AUTHOR, a number of works have focused on this challenge, see for example the systems participating in the simplification shared task at SemEval-2012 AUTHOR. However, the task has been designed as an exercise to replace complex single tokens with simpler single tokens, and most widely used benchmarks and systems all follow this paradigm. We believe, however, that this setting covers only a limited number of lexical simplifications as they would be performed in a real scenario. In particular, we advocate the need to shift the lexical simplification paradigm from single tokens to phrases, and to develop datasets and tools that deal also with these cases. This is mainly the contribution of this work, which covers four main points: \item We analyse existing corpora of simplified texts, not specifically developed for a shared task or for system evaluation, and we measure the impact of phrases in lexical simplifications \item We modify a state-of-the-art tool for lexical simplification in order to support phrases \item We compare different strategies for phrase extraction and evaluate them over a benchmark \item We perform all the above on Italian, for which there was no lexical simplification system available.

AL allows for the collection of more useful training data, while at the same time reducing the annotation effort AUTHOR. In the AL framework samples are usually selected according to several criteria, such as informativeness, representativeness, and diversity AUTHOR. This paper investigates AL selection strategies that consider the categories the current classifier assigns to samples, combined with the confidence of the classifier on the same samples. We are interested in understanding whether these strategies are effective, particularly when category distribution and category performance are unbalanced.

Unfortunately, this straightforward result requires the existence of large-scale corpora and they are not available for many languages. This paper describes a simple methodology to automatically acquire a large-scale corpus of 600 thousand image/sentences pairs in Italian. At the best of our knowledge, this corpus has been used to train one of the first neural systems for the same language. The experimental evaluation over a subset of validated image/captions pairs suggests that results comparable with the English counterpart can be achieved.","The image captioning task consists in generating a brief description in natural language of a given image that is able to capture the depicted objects and the relations between them, as discussed in AUTHOR. More precisely, given an image I as input, an image captioner should be able to generate a well-formed sentence {S(I)=(s_1,...,s_m)}, where every s_i is a word from a vocabulary V=\{w_1,...,w_n\} in a given natural language. Some examples of images and corresponding captions are reported in Figure fig:mscoco_images. This task is rather complex as it involves non-trivial subtasks to solve, such as object detection, mapping visual features to text and generating text sequences. Recently, neural methods based on deep neural networks have reached impressive state-of-the-art results in solving this task AUTHOR. One of the most successful architectures implements the so-called encoder-decoder end-to-end structure AUTHOR. Differently by most of the existing encoder-decoder structures, in AUTHOR the encoding of the input image is performed by a convolutional neural network which transform it in a dense feature vector; then, this vector is ``translated'' to a descriptive sentence by a Long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, which takes the vector as the first input and generates a textual sequence starting from it. This neural model is very effective, but also very expensive to train in terms of time and hardware resources on a dataset of over 580,000 image-caption examples takes about two weeks even with a very performing GPU.}, because there are many parameters to be learned; not to mention that the model is overfitting-prone, thus it needs to be trained on a training set of annotated images that is as large and heterogeneous as possible, in order to achieve a good generalization capability. Hardware and time constraints do not always allow to train a model in an optimal setting, and, for example, cutting down on the dataset size could be necessary: in this case we have poor training conditions. Of course, this reduces the model's ability to generalize on new images at captioning time. Another cause of poor training conditions is the lack of a good quality dataset, for example in terms of annotations: the manual captioning of large collections of images requires a lot of effort and, as of now, human-annotated datasets only exist for a restricted set of languages, such as in English. As a consequence, training such a neural model to produce captions in another language (e.g. in Italian) is an interesting problem to explore, but also challenging due to the lack of data resources. A viable approach is building a resource by automatically translating the annotations from an existing dataset: much less expensive than manually annotating images, but of course it leads to a loss of human-like quality in the language model. This approach has been considered in this work to perform one of the first neural-based image captioning in Italian: more precisely, the annotations of the images from the MSCOCO dataset, one of the largest datasets in English of image/caption pairs, have been automatically translated to Italian in order to obtain a first resource for this language: this has been exploited to train a neural captioner and whose quality can be improved over time (e.g., by manually validating the translations). Then, a subset of this Italian dataset has been used as training data for the neural captioning system defined in AUTHOR, while a subset of the test set has been manually validated for evaluation purposes. In particular, prior to the experimentations in Italian, some early experiments have been performed with the same training data originally annotated in English, to get a reference benchmark about convergence time and evaluation metrics on a dataset of smaller size. These results in English will suggest if the Italian image captioner shows similar performance when trained over a reduced set of examples or the noise induced in the automatic translation process compromises the neural training phase. Moreover, these experiments have also been performed with the introduction of a pre-trained word embedding, (derived using the method presented in AUTHOR), in order to measure how it affects the quality of the language model learned by the captioner, with respect to a randomly initialized word embedding that is learned together with the other model parameters. Overall the contributions of this work are threefold: (i) the investigation of a simple, automatized way to acquire (possibly noisy) large-scale corpora for the training of neural image captioning methods in poor training conditions; (ii) the manual validation of a first set of human-annotated resources in Italian; (iii) the implementation of one of the first automatic neural-based Italian image captioners. In the rest of the paper, the adopted neural architecture is outlined in Section sec:arch. The description of a brand new resource for Italian is presented in Section sec:resource. Section sec:exp reports the results of the early preparatory experimentations for the English language and then the ones for Italian. Finally, Section sec:concl derives the conclusions.","In this paper a simple methodology for the training of neural models for the automatic captioning of images is presented. We generated a large scale of about 600,000 image captions in Italian by using an automatic machine translator. Although the noise introduced in this step, it allows to train one of the first neural-based image captioning systems for Italian. Most importantly, the quality of this system seems comparable with the English counterpart, if trained over a comparable set of data. These results are impressive and confirm the robustness of the adopted Neural Architecture.

The long term goal which oriented the study is the formalization of this information into a natural language generation system. Providing that adjectives mainly occur within noun phrases, we focused on them and we collected data from corpora representing very different text genres, i.e. social media and standard ones, in order to compare the theoretical predictions with the real use of the adjective in Italian. The results obtained by confirm the previsions of the modern linguistic theories but also show the different behaviour of adjectives in the distinct analysed genres.","Corpus linguistics is a methodological approach based on the extraction from a set of texts of data useful for the study of language. Even if in principle any collection of texts can be called corpus, the term assumes a more precise connotation in the context of modern linguistics, where a corpus is featured by sampling, representativeness, finite size, machine-readable form and a standard reference AUTHOR. In this work we have applied a corpus-based approach and we considered two different corpora which represent two different text genres: one concerning social media language (PoSTWITA corpus) and one concerning balanced standard Italian (UD-it corpus). Indeed, while social media texts have recently gained great attention from the NLP community since they have many peculiar properties, standard texts can give a more accurate view on the status of some linguistic notions in ``traditional'' written text. These above mentioned corpora allowed us an in depth investigation about the position of the adjective in the nominal phrase. Indeed, even if this grammatical category is described in several traditional Italian grammars AUTHOR, its theoretical status is not currently enough formalized to be used within the computational context. A more useful perspective on the behaviour of the adjective is proposed in a recent theoretical study which is focussed on the position of the adjective in Romance languages AUTHOR. This work aims at achieving two major goals. The first is to empirically confirm with the analysis of corpora the theoretical predictions given in AUTHOR. The second goal is instead to provide a representation and classification of Italian adjective category that can be spent within the SimpleNLG-IT AUTHOR, a surface realizer for Italian language.\\ The paper is organized as follows: in Section~sec::theory we review the linguistic literature concerning the position of the adjective within the Italian noun phrase. In Section~sec::corpora, we explain the details of our corpus linguistic investigation. In Section~sec::nlg, we describe the use of the empirical data in the SimpleNLG-IT realizer. Finally, the Section~sec::conclusions closes the paper with conclusions and some pointers to future work.","The paper presents a study about the behaviour of the adjective within the noun phrase. Providing that the qualitative description given by traditional grammars does not allow the definition of a formal model, we considered a recent study that classifies the descriptive adjectives. The long term goal which oriented this study is to contribute to the development of a natural language generation system for Italian featured by a more careful modelling of the behaviour of words within sentence structures.\\ Assuming a corpus-based perspective we tested on two corpora for Italian the tenets of this study. The results confirm and validate the theory thus opening the window for a definition of a formal model that can be exploited in our computational framework. Future work is planned to extend the validation of our model on larger datasets, where a wider variety of adjectives is used and also more complex noun phrase structures are taken into account with respect to the simple \textlessadjective - noun\textgreater or \textlessnoun - adjective\textgreater associations here considered. In particular, providing that more than one adjective can occurs within a noun phrase and can be syntactically linked to a single noun, we intend to investigate on the preference order also in these cases.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We focus on why Pragmatics is important in developing next generation chatbots by bringing a few generalizable examples. We report our current experience on the design and implementation of a task-oriented textual chatbot for a closed-domain Question Answering system, which tackles problems in Pragmatics.","Chatbot, chatterbot, natural-language interface, dialogue system are some of the terms used to re- fer to softwares that aim to carry on conversations with humans (AUTHOR; LAUTHOR; AUTHOR). We will not go into further details about the classification and definition of such softwares. We will use chatbot as if it was a hypernym of the above mentioned softwares instead. Chatbots and Intent Understanding. The goal of an intelligent chatbot is to understand the user’s intent AUTHOR and behave accordingly. Such goal is quite complex to achieve, and beyond the capability of current state of the art chatbots. However, the hype around chatbots has raised awareness of what elements are needed for a chatbot to manage human-like interactions. It is generally agreed that to build effective and solid chatbots the following is needed: Natural Language Processing (NLP): much of the intelligence needed to understand human intent lies in the processing of human language. Hence, the development and improvement of NLP algorithms is a necessary prerequisite for the creation of intelligent chatbots. Machine Learning (ML): chatbot design should rely on ML for learning and automatically con- solidating NLP rules by means of observation of past experience - i.e., past conversations and their outcomes AUTHOR. Current chatbot development, given enough annotated data, should consider adopting recently developed algorithms that are task-oriented (AUTHOR) or topic aware (AUTHOR). Developments in reinforcement learning applications seem promising for task-oriented dialogue systems AUTHOR. Context and State Awareness: depending on the purpose of the chatbot, the component responsible for the managing of the conversation (Dialogue Manager System - DMS) should take into account both context and states variables AUTHOR. From the DMS point of view, chatbots are usually classified as: stateless chatbots; semi-stateful chatbots; stateful chatbots (next generation chat- bots). During the conversation, state transitions depend on the information acquired before. As for the follow up action, it depends on the recognized context. Natural Language Generation (NLG): NLG concerns what information and in what form it should be delivered AUTHOR. Dealing with ""real"" conversation requires being both proactive (e.g. suggest the best option; drive along the compilation of a form; remind planned activities; ...) AUTHOR and adaptive (e.g. change style - both in written and spoken scenarios - according to domain, mood of the user, or sociolinguistic variables). We argue here that, in addition to the above mentioned, moving from Semantics to Pragmatics plays a crucial role in building chatbots. This is because a lot of the knowledge human beings share during a conversation gets constructed along the conversation itself (AUTHOR; AUTHOR). For instance, let’s consider the following mock dialogue between Human (H) and Chatbot (C): H lands on a money transfer service page. H: Hello, I would like to make a transfer C: Hello. Sure. Would you like to know more about: [FAQ menu about transfer service is shown]? H navigates the FAQ menu H signs up online to proceed with the transfer. H: I would like to make a transfer C: Sure. It only takes a couple of minutes C starts the procedure to execute the transfer. In this interaction, the sentence “I would like to make a transfer” instantiates two different in- tents: informative intent, at first (H is looking for information about the transfer service); follow up intent, then (once H is satisfied with transfer service conditions, he/she wants to proceed with the transfer). Such pragmatic disambiguation involves taking knowledge from the conversational context into account, which is one of the most difficult tasks for a chatbot. We report below how we deal with this task in our task-oriented closed- domain chatbot.","We are currently in the process of evaluating Financial QA according to a framework based on PARADISE (AUTHOR; AUTHOR), which considers, among the others, the following indicators: Task Ease, NLU Performance, Expected Behavior, Presentation, Verbal Presentation, Future Use. We plan to finalize our evaluation in the next months. NLP is crucial for the development of robust chatbots; since extra-linguistic elements are potenTially very important in intent understanding, moving from semantics to pragmatics is a necessary step to develop next-generation chatbots. We have shown how Dialogue Management can support a more robust handling of context, at least in closed- domain QA tasks. Further work is required to handle more business cases and a broader definition of context, such as history of activities conducted by the same user, which can be especially useful in chatbots with recommender functions AUTHOR. We would like to thank Andrea Bolioli for his help in the review phase and all of our CELI colleagues for their invaluable work and support.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

In this paper we will test the effectiveness of the computational treatment of the taboo contents shared on the web, the output is a corpus of 31,749 Facebook comments which has been automatically annotated through a lexicon-based method for the automatic identification and classification of taboo expressions.","Flaming, trolling, harassment, cyberbullying, cyberstalking, cyberthreats are all terms used for referring to vulgar and offensive contents shared on the web. The shapes can be different and the focus can be on various topics, such as physical appearance, ethnicity, sexuality, social acceptance and so forth. Although taboo language is generally considered to be the strongest clue of harassment in the web, it must be clarified that the presence of bad words in posts does not necessarily indicate the presence of offensive behaviors. The words collected in vulgar lexicons, in some cases, are neutral or even positive. Moreover, profanity can be used with comical or satirical purposes, and bad words are often just the expression of strong emotions AUTHOR. In this paper, we propose a system for the automatic treatment of vulgar and offensive utterances in Italian. The strength of our method is that lexical items are not considered in isolation. Instead, we recognize the power of the local context of the words, which can modulate the meaning of words, phrases and sentences. Section soa briefly illustrates the state of the art contributions on offensive language modeling. Next, Section LGR describes the Italian lexical and grammatical resources for the automatic detection of taboo language in Italian. Then, Section evaluation explains how we tested our method and resources on a Facebook corpus and describes the results of the taboo expressions automatic annotation. Finally, Section conclusion reports the future works that will enhance our research.","In this paper we described an experiment on the detection and classification of offenses, threats and insults shared through User Generated Contents. As a matter of fact, in May 2016, the European Commission, together with companies like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft, underlined the relevance of these topics by presenting a code of conduct which aimed to constrain the virality of illegal online violence and hate speech, with a special focus on utterances fomenting racism, xenophobia and terrorist contents. The negative impact of such practices is not limited to individuals, but strongly affects the freedom of expression and the democratic discourse on the Web. Our research focused on a particular Facebook page, which became famous in Italy for the number of times it has been shut down due to its disturbing content. More than 31,000 users' comments downloaded from this page have been automatically annotated according to a dataset of taboo expressions, in the form of simple words and multiword expressions. This operation has led to a hate speech annotated corpus which distinguishes eight harassment semantic fields, four types of insult and four hate targets (traits). The evaluation of the experiment performances confirmed the hypothesis that the local context of words represents an essential feature for an effective hate speech mining on the web. In future works we will test the interaction of the taboo item located in the corpus with some Italian Contextual Valence Shifters AUTHOR in order to verify if the sentence context of the insult indicators affects the semantic orientation of the items into an Opinion Mining view. Furthermore, it would be interesting to verify the efficacy of our resources and our method on different domains, Political Communication, among others. In the end, just because the automatic extraction has been done in this paper on a very polarized corpus, future analyses will focus on testing the reliability of this research on more neutral collections of texts.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The goal was pursued by carrying out incremental feature selection through Grafting using different sets %(word-level vs multi-level) of linguistic features. Achieved results for discriminating among four traditional textual genres show the key role played by syntactic features, whose impact turned out to vary across genres.","Automatic classification of textual genres has always received significant attention from both theoretical and application perspectives. On the one hand, it has been considered relevant by linguists and educators to teach students the correct way of writing in specific communicative scenarios AUTHOR. On the other hand, the classification of textual genres is seen as a way to cope with the well known problem of information overload: the exploitation of information about document genre can help to develop more accurate Information Retrieval tools. Genre identification has been considered a key factor for reducing irrelevant %inadequate results of search engines, as users would be able to specify the desired textual genre along with the keywords expressing the content they are looking for AUTHOR. In fact, document genre and document content represent orthogonal dimensions of classifications AUTHOR. A variety of different approaches to Automatic Genre Classification (AGC) has been proposed so far differing at the level of the genre and the typology of features considered. According to the widely acknowledged fact that no established classification of genres exists (see e.g. AUTHOR or AUTHOR), previous studies focused on `traditional genres' such as journalism, handbooks, academic prose, see among the others AUTHOR, and on `web genres', i.e.\ genres of web pages, see e.g. AUTHOR. Despite the great interest in the investigation of which linguistic features qualify a text genre AUTHOR, so far little effort has been devoted to use sophisticated NLP techniques, such as %dependency syntactic parsing, to capture complex linguistic features for the automatic classification of textual genres. Differently from other application scenarios where the form (the style) of a document is investigated, such as e.g. Authorship Attribution AUTHOR, Readability Assessment AUTHOR and Native Language Identification AUTHOR, AGC approaches proposed so far mainly focus on word level linguistic features, in particular the distribution of function words, word frequency, n--gram models of both characters and Parts--Of-Speech AUTHOR or finer-grained Parts--Of-Speech tags including morpho-syntactic features such as verb tense AUTHOR. Very few studies rely on features extracted from syntactically annotated texts, the exception being AUTHOR who combines lexical features (i.e.\ word frequency) with features extracted from the output of a chunk boundary detector (e.g. the distribution of noun, verbal, adjectival phrases), the average number of words included in verbal phrases. Similar structural features have been also used by AUTHOR who combined web--specific features (e.g.\ HTML tags) with lexical information and features aiming at capturing the syntactic structure of a sentence, e.g. the distribution of declarative and imperative sentences, syntactic ambiguities, etc. In this paper, we tackle the AGC task for traditional genres (namely literary, scientific, educational and journalistic texts) by using different types of linguistic features, i.e. lexical, morpho-syntactic and syntactic. In particular, the following research questions are addressed: i) which are the most effective features to classify a textual genre, and ii) whether and to what extent features identified as most effective remain the same across different genres. These questions have been addressed by carrying out incremental feature selection with the final aim of identifying the most predictive ones. So far, studies focused on the best set of features to classify textual genres have been carried out mainly on English. In this paper, this issue is investigated for a typologically different language, Italian.","""In this paper we investigated impact and role of different feature types for Automatic Genre Classification. The goal was pursued by carrying out incremental feature selection through Grafting augmented with TinyEst. Two sets of features were taken into account, token-based and structure-based. Achieved results %for discriminating among four traditional textual genres show the key role played by syntactic features, % with respect to token-based ones: a result %, possibly influenced by the language dealt with (Italian), which is new with respect to the AGC literature.

The features contributing to AGC for Italian are possibly influenced by the language dealt with. Although it is widely acknowledged that linguistic variation across genres is a language universal, the question is whether similar linguistic features are expected to play a similar role across languages. If this might be the case of features such as e.g. TTR, use of passive voice, tenses or pronouns, on the other hand features concerned with the ordering of sentence constituents or the overall sentence structure (e.g. parse tree depth or dependency length) may be distinctive to a specific language or language family. Further directions of research thus include comparison of results in a multilingual perspective as well as across a wider variety of genres.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

One limitation of NMT is the difficulty to learn representations of rare words. The most common solution is to segment words into sub-words, in order to allow for shared representations of infrequent words. In this paper we present ways to directly feed a NMT network with external word embeddings trained on monolingual source data, thus enabling a virtually infinite source vocabulary. Our preliminary results show that while our methods do not seem effective under large-data training conditions (WMT En-De), they instead show great potential for the typical low-resourced data scenario (IWSLT En-Fr). By leveraging external embeddings learned on Web crawled English texts, we were able to improve a word-level En-Fr baseline trained on 200,000 sentence pairs by up to 4 BLEU points.","The latest developments of machine translation have been led by the neural approach (AUTHOR; AUTHOR), a deep-learning based technique that has shown to outperform the previous methods in all the recent evaluation campaigns (AUTHOR; AUTHOR). NMT mainly relies on parallel data, which are expensive to produce as they involve human translation. Recently, back-translation AUTHOR has been proposed to leverage target language data. This consists in enriching the training data with synthetic translations produced with a reverse MT system AUTHOR. Unfortunately, this method introduces noise and seems really effective only when the synthetic parallel sentences are only a fraction of the true ones. Hence, this approach does not allow to leverage huge quantities of monolingual data. One consequence of the scarcity of parallel data is the occurrence of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and rare words. In fact, being NMT a statistical approach, it cannot learn meaningful representations or rare words and no representation at all for OOV words. The solution up to this moment is to segment words into sub-words (AUTHOR; AUTHOR) in order to have a better representation of rare and OOV words, as parts of their representation will be ideally shared with other words. The drawback of this approach is that it generates longer input sequences, thus exacerbates the handling of long-term dependencies (AUTHOR). In this paper, we propose to keep the source input at a word level while alleviating the problem of rare and OOV words. We do it by integrating the usual word indexes with word embeddings that have been pre-trained on huge monolingual data. The intuition is that the network should learn to use the provided representations, which should be possibly more reliable for the rare words. This should be true particularly for the low-resource settings, where pa- rameter transfer has shown to be an effective approach (AUTHOR). Because of the softmax layer, the same idea cannot be applied straightforwardly to the target side, hence we continue to use sub-words there. We show that the network is capable to learn how to translate from the input embeddings while replacing the source embedding layer with a much smaller feed-forward layer. Our results show that this method seems effective in a small training data setting, while it does not seem to help under large training data conditions. In the following section we briefly describe the state-of- the-art NMT architecture. Then, we introduce our modification to enable the use of external word embeddings. In Section 4, we introduce the experimental setup and show our results, while in Section 5 we discuss our solution. Finally, in Section 6 we presents our conclusions and the future work.","In this paper we propose three methods to extend the input word embeddings to an NMT network in order to leverage a word representation coming from a big monolingual corpus. Our results show that this approach greatly improves over an NMT baseline in a low-resource scenario, while it is not helpful for better-resourced tasks. Using monolingual data for improving NMT is a problem also in the latter case, thus our future work will focus on how to integrate models larger than word embeddings, and trained on monolingual data, to improve word and sentence representations.",10,Machine Translation

We discuss our results comparing them both to other unsupervised models designed to perform idiom detection and to similar supervised classifiers trained to detect metaphoric bigrams.,"Figurative expressions like idioms (e.g. to learn the ropes `to learn how to do a job', to cut the mustard `to perform up to expectations', etc.) and metaphors (e.g. clean performance, that lawyer is a shark, etc.) are pervasive in language use. Important differences have been stressed between the two types of expressions from a theoretical AUTHOR, neurocognitive AUTHOR and corpus linguistic AUTHOR prespective. On the one hand, as stated by \citet{lakoff2008metaphors}, linguistic metaphors reflect an instantiation of conceptual metaphors, whereby abstract concepts in a target domain (e.g. the ruthlessness of a lawyer) are described by a rather transparent mapping to concrete examples taken from a source domain (e.g. the aggressiveness of a shark). On the other hand, although most idioms originate as metaphors AUTHOR, they have undergone a crystallization process in diachrony, whereby they now appear as fixed and non-compositional word combinations that belong to the wider class of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) AUTHOR and always exhibit lexical and morphosyntactic rigidity to some extent AUTHOR. It is anyway crucial to underline that idiomaticity itself is a multidimensional and gradient phenomenon AUTHOR with different idioms showing varying degrees of semantic transparency, formal versatility, proverbiality and affective valence.% All this variance within the class of idioms themselves has been demonstrated to affect the processing of such expressions in different ways AUTHOR. The aim of this work is to explore the fuzzy boundary between idiomatic and metaphorical expression, by applying a method designed to discriminate figurative vs. literal usages to the task of distinguishing idiomatic from compositional expressions. Our starting point is the work of \citet{Bizzoni:17}. The authors managed to classify adjective-noun pairs where the same adjectives were used both in a metaphorical and a literal sense (e.g. clean performance vs. clean floor) using a neural classifier trained on a composition of the words' embeddings AUTHOR. Actually, the neural network was able to detect the abstract/concrete semantic shift of nouns when used with the same adjective in figurative and literal compositions respectively, basically treating the noun as the ``context'' to discriminate the metaphoricity of the adjective. In our attempt, we will use a relatively similar approach to classify idiomatic expressions by training a three-layered neural network on a set of idiomatic and non-idiomatic expressions and we'll compare the performance of the network when trained on different syntactic patterns (Adjective-Noun and Verb-Noun expressions, AN and VN henceforth). Importantly, the abstract/concrete polarity the network was able to learn in AUTHOR will not be available this time, since none of the idiom constituents will ever appear in its literal sense inside the expressions, whatever their concreteness may be. What we want to find out is whether the sole information captured by the distributional vector of a single expression is sufficient to learn its potential idiomaticity. Differently from AUTHOR, for each idiom we collect a count-based vector AUTHOR of the expression as a whole, taken as a single token. We compare this approach with a model trained on the composition of the individual words of an expression, showing that the latter is less effective for idioms than for metaphors. In both cases we will be operating on scarce training sets (26 AN and 90 VN constructions). Traditional ways to deal with data scarcity in computational linguistics resort to a wide number of different features to annotate the training set (see for example AUTHOR) or rely on artificial bootstrapping of the training set AUTHOR. In our case we test the performance of our classifier on scarce data without bootstrapping the dataset and relying only on the information provided by the distributional semantic space, showing that the distribution of an expression in large corpora can provide enough information to learn idiomaticity from few examples with a satisfactory degree of accuracy.","It seems that the distribution of idiomatic and compositional expressions in large corpora can suffice for a supervised classifier to learn the difference between the two linguistic elements from small training sets and with a good level of accuracy. Unlike with metaphors AUTHOR, feeding the classifier with a composition of the individual words' vectors of such expressions performs quite scarcely and can be used to detect only some idioms. This takes us back to the core difference that while metaphors are more compositional and preserve a transparent source domain to target domain mapping, idioms are by and large non-compositional. Since our classifiers rely only on contextual features, their ability in classification must stem from a difference in distribution between idioms and non-idioms. A possible explanation is that while the literal expressions we selected, like vedere un film or ascoltare un discorso, tend to be used with animated subjects and thus to appear in more concrete contexts, most of our idioms (e.g. cadere dal cielo or lasciare il segno) allow for varying degrees of animacy or concreteness of the subject, and thus their context can easily get more diverse. At the same time, the drop in performance we observe in the joint models seems to indicate that the different parts of speech composing our elements entail a significant contextual difference between the two groups, which introduces a considerable amount of uncertainty in our model. It is also possible that other contextual elements we did not consider have played a role in the learning process of our models. We intend to deepen this aspect in future works.",22,Distributional Semantics

To understand how Part-of-Speech taggers that have been pre-trained on standard Italian fare with a wide array of language anomalies, we evaluate five Part-of-Speech taggers on a corpus of student essays written throughout the largest Italian-speaking area outside of Italy. Our preliminary results show that there is a significant gap between their performance on non-standard Italian and on standard Italian, and that the performance loss mainly comes from relatively subtle tagging errors within morphological categories as opposed to coarse errors across categories.","The goal of this paper is to present the preliminary results of the evaluation of a set of state-of-the-art Part of Speech (PoS) taggers on the \tiscrivo corpus of Italian-language (L1) K-12 student essays from schools in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. The \tiscrivo corpus represents an example of non-standard Italian} because its contributors are young students with a poor command of the Italian language living in the largest Italian-speaking area outside of Italy, and therefore prone to regionalisms as well as orthographic mistakes. The key research question at this stage is how well state-of-the-art PoS taggers that were pre-trained on standard Italian cope with a specific flavor of non-standard Italian. It would of course be possible to retrain all these tools on texts with similar properties as the ones in our corpus, but at this stage in our work this is not possible due to the overly small size of the available annotated data. In turn, using pre-trained models gives us a twofold advantage: it allows us to obtain a performance baseline on non-standard Italian, and it makes it possible to directly compare our performance metrics to previously published results (obtained with the same models we use). While our work is still in progress and the results reported herein are preliminary in nature, we can already share several notable observations.","We have presented a comparative performance assessment of five state-of-the-art PoS taggers on the \tiscrivo corpus of K-12 student essays, along with an analysis of the patterns that can be observed in the mistakes made by individual taggers. As this is still a work in progress, the results in the paper are limited to a subset of the corpus containing fifth grade essays. These results provide a valuable baseline that could likely be improved with domain adaptation. On the other hand, it is fair to ask whether the \tiscrivo corpus is different enough from standard Italian to warrant domain adaptation, or whether we would encounter issues with overfitting. In the latter case, an alternative would be the rule-based combination of the output of the five taggers, informed with the knowledge of the observed error patterns.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

These algorithms have many hyper-parameter that have to be carefully tuned in order to obtain accurate word representation in vectorial space. We provide an extensive analysis and an evaluation, showing what are the best configuration of parameters for specific analogy tasks.","The distributional hypothesis of language, set forth by AUTHOR and AUTHOR, states that the meaning of a word can be inferred from the contexts in which it is used. Using the co-occurrence of words in a large corpus, we can observe for example that the contexts in which client is used are very similar to those in which customer occur, while less similar to those in which waitress or retailer occur. A wide range of algorithms have been developed to exploit these properties. Recently, one of the most widely used method in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks is word embeddings AUTHOR. It is based on neural network techniques and has demonstrated to capture semantic and syntactic properties of words taking as input raw texts without other sources of information. It represents each word as a vector such that words that appear in similar contexts are represented with similar vectors AUTHOR. The dimensions of the word are not easily interpretable and, with respect to explicit representation, they do not correspond to specific concepts. In AUTHOR, the authors propose two different models that seek to maximize, respectively, the probability of a word given its context (Continuous bag-of-word model), and the probability of the surrounding words (before and after the current word) given the current word (Skip-gram model). In this work we seek to further explore the relationships by generating word embedding for over 40 different parameterizations of the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and the skip-gram (SG) architectures, since as shown in AUTHOR the choice of the hyper-parameters heavily affect the construction of the embedding spaces. Specifically our contributions include: \item Word embedding. The analysis of how different hyper-parameters can achieve different accuracy levels in relation recovery tasks AUTHOR. \item Morpho-syntactic and semantic analysis. Word embeddings have demonstrated to capture semantic and syntactic properties, we compare two different objectives to recover relational similarities for semantic and morph-syntactical tasks. \item Qualitative analysis. We investigate problematic cases.",We have tested two word representation methods: SG and CBOW training them only on a dump of the Italian Wikipedia. We compared the results of the two models using 12 combinations of hyper-parameters. We have adopted a simple word analogy test to evaluate the generated word embeddings. The results have shown that increasing the number of dimensions and the number of negative examples improve the performance of both the models. These types of improvement seems to be beneficial only for the semantic relationships. On the contrary the syntactical relationship are negatively affected by the low frequency of many of its terms. This should be related to the morphological complexity of Italian. In the future it would be helpful to represent the spatial relationship regarding specific syntactical domain in order to evaluate the contribution of hyper-parametrization to syntactical relationship accuracy. Moreover future work will include the testing of these word embedding parametrizations in practical applications (e.g. analysis of patents'descriptions and books' corpora).,22,Distributional Semantics

Most of the work has been focused on the detection of figurative language in Twitter data due to relative ease of obtaining annotated data, thanks to the use of hashtags to signal irony. However, irony is present generally in natural language conversations and in particular in online public fora. In this paper, we present a comparative evaluation of irony detection from Italian news fora and Twitter posts. Since irony is not a very frequent phenomenon, its automatic detection suffers from data imbalance and feature sparseness problems. We experiment with different representations of text -- bag-of-words, writing style, and word embeddings to address the feature sparseness; and balancing techniques to address the data imbalance.","The detection of irony in user generated content is one of the major issues in sentiment analysis and opinion mining AUTHOR. The problem is that irony can flip the polarity of apparently positive sentences, negatively affecting the performance of sentiment polarity classification AUTHOR. Detecting irony from text is extremely difficult because it is deeply related to many out-of-text factors such as context, intonation, speakers' intentions, background knowledge and so on. This also affects interpretation and annotation of irony by humans, often leading to low inter-annotator agreements. Twitter posts are frequently used for the irony detection research, since users often signal irony in their posts utilizing hashtags such as \#irony, \#justjoking, etc. Despite the relative ease of collecting the data, Twitter is a very particular kind of text. In this paper we experiment with different representations of text to evaluate the utility of Twitter data for the detection of irony in text coming from other sources such as news fora. The representations of text -- bag-of-words, writing style, and word embeddings -- are chosen such that they are not dependent on the resources available for the language. Due to the fact that irony is less frequent than literal meaning, the data is usually imbalanced. We experiment with balancing techniques such as random undersampling, random oversampling and cost-sensitive training to observe its effects on a supervised irony detection. The paper is structured as follows. In Section sec:works we introduce related work on irony. In Section sec:data we describe the corpora used throughout experiments. In Sections sec:method and sec:exp we describe the methodology and the result of the experiments. In Section sec:conc we provide concluding remarks.","We have presented experiments on irony detection in Italian Twitter and news fora data comparing different document representations -- bag-of-words, writing style as stylometric features, and word embeddings. The objective is to evaluate the suitability of Twitter data for detecting irony in news fora. The models were compared for balanced and imbalanced training, as well as cross-corpora performance. We have observed that the bag-of-words representation with imbalanced cost-insensitive training produces the best results (micro-F_1) across settings, closely followed by cost-sensitive training. The models outperform the results on irony detection in Italian tweets AUTHOR in terms of macro-F_1 scores reported for SENTIPOLC 2016 AUTHOR. However, micro-F_1 is the most informative metric for the downstream application of irony detection, as it considers the total amount of true positives. Given that the highest micro-F_1 is attained by the majority baselines for both corpora (0.8829 for SENTIPOLC and 0.7996 for CorEA), the task of irony detection is far from being solved.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Results show that the system is able to achieve state of the art performance in all the tasks and in some cases overcomes the best systems previously developed for the Italian.","Deep Learning (DL) gained a lot of attention in last years for its capacity to generalize models without the need of feature engineering and its ability to provide good performance. On the other hand good performance can be achieved by accu- rately designing the architecture used to perform the learning task. In Natural Language Processing (NLP) several DL architectures have been proposed to solve many tasks, ranging from speech recognition to parsing. Some typical NLP tasks can be solved as sequence labeling problem, such as part-of-speech (PoS) tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER). Traditional high performance NLP methods for sequence labeling are linear statistical models, including Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) (AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR), which rely on hand-crafted features and task/language specific resources. However, developing such task/language specific resources has a cost, moreover it makes difficult to adapt the model to new tasks, new domains or new languages. In AUTHOR, the authors propose a state of the art sequence labeling method based on a neural network architecture that benefits from both word- and character-level representations through the combination of bidirectional LSTM, CNN and CRF. The method is able to achieve state of the art performance in sequence labeling tasks for the English without the use of hand-crafted features. In this paper, we exploit the aforementioned architecture for solving three NLP tasks in Italian: PoS-tagging of tweets, NER and Super Sense Tagging (SST). Our research question is to prove the effectiveness of the DL architecture in a different language, in this case Italian, without using language specific features. The results of the evaluation prove that our approach is able to achieve state of the art performance and in some cases it is able to overcome the best systems developed for the Italian without the usage of specific language resources.

All tasks exploit data coming from EVALITA a standard benchmark for the evaluation of Italian NLP systems. Our system is able to achieve good performance in all the tasks without using hand-crafted features. Analyzing the results, we observe the importance of building word embeddings on appropriate corpora and we note that the system in the SST task is not able to generalize a good model without the pos-tag feature, this underline the importance of this kind of feature in the SST task. As future work, we plan to perform a parameters optimization by reducing the training set and using a portion as validation set. Using less data for training could affect the final performance and it could be interesting to have insights on the trade-off between training on more examples versus the parameters optimization.",1,Language Models

We discuss the creation of an annotated corpus with documents from the Italian Albo Pretorio Nazionale and provide results of the system evaluation.","In the Public Administration (PA) domain, the rapid adoption of the new legislation about the governance transparency has been forcing Italian municipalities to produce their acts in a digital form and to make them available for both citizens and authorities. However, the acts delivered by PAs are typically in a free-text electronic format, which is not convenient for searching, decision-support, and data analysis. Therefore, the development of NLP tools to extract high-quality structured information, including Named Entities (NEs) such as Persons and Organizations, represents a key factor to enable the access to the wealth of information produced by PAs, and a crucial step in turning the keyword of ``transparency'' into reality. The potentialities of NLP tools can be exploited to mine the large document repositories produced by PA daily, with the aim of identifying trends in their activity, suggesting possible synergies to increase their efficiency, and raising ``red flags'' about suspicious behaviors, especially for their relationships with private companies. In this paper, we focus on Named Entity Recognition (NER) for PA. Several approaches have been proposed in literature including Rule-based, Machine Learning-based and Hybrid methods. Hand-made Rule-based NERs focus on extracting names using lots of human-made rules. In general, these systems consist of a set of patterns based on grammatical (e.g., part of speech), syntactic (e.g., word precedence) and orthographic features (e.g., capitalization) in combination with dictionaries AUTHOR. These approaches usually give good results, but require long development time by expert linguists. On the one hand, these systems have better results for restricted domains, being capable of detecting very complex entities, but, on the other one, they lack portability and robustness and do not necessarily adapt well to new domains and languages. Machine learning techniques, on the contrary, use a collection of annotated documents for training the classifiers. Therefore the development time moves from the definition of rules to the preparation of annotated corpora AUTHOR. The systems identify and classify nouns using machine learning algorithms such as Maximum Entropy AUTHOR, Support Vector Machines AUTHOR and Conditional Random Field AUTHOR. More recently, also deep learning architectures have been proposed for Named Entity Recognition AUTHOR. Finally, Hybrid NER systems, combine rule-based and machine learning-based methods, and make new methods using strongest points from each method AUTHOR. Existing general purpose Italian corpora annotated with NEs such as I-CAB AUTHOR are not optimal for training a NER for the domain of PA because of the gap between bureaucratic language and standard Italian, and also because of the lack of important classes such as act and normative references, that are very useful in PA-oriented applications. To tackle these problems, we decided to create a new corpus from scratch starting from: \item administrative documents belonging to the Italian Albo Pretorio; \item the CoLingLab NER, a general NER trained on I-CAB, from which we took the initial configuration of features. The corpus of PA documents written in Italian ``bureaucratese'', has the characteristics described in AUTHOR:\item Pseudo-technicisms or collateral technicisms (e.g., balneazione, fattispecie); \item Abstract nouns with -zione/-mento suffixes (e.g., stipulazione, espletamento), deverbal nouns, usually with zero suffix (e.g., subentro, scorporo, utilizzo) and denominal verbs (e.g., relazionare, disdettare); \item Archaic terms (e.g., allorché, suddetto) and latinisms (e.g. una tantum, pro capite); \item Forestierisms (e.g., governance, front office); \item Uncommon and formal terms (e.g., diniego for rifiuto); \item Stereotyped phrases (e.g., entro e non oltre, in riferimento all’oggetto); \item Abbreviations and acronyms. For the creation of a NER for PA, we decided to exploit the existing architecture employed for the project SEMPLICE) is a 2-year project funded by Regione Toscana in collaboration with IT companies to develop NLP-based tools for knowledge management, information extraction and opinion mining for local public administrations.} and in particular we adopted a statistical method based on the Stanford NER AUTHOR, a system implemented in Java and available for download under the GNU General Public License. This choice allowed us to easily compare the gain obtained by enriching the training corpus with PA documents and to speed up the development process. Moreover, using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) AUTHOR as learning algorithm made it possible for us to compare the PA model with other domain-adapted NERs AUTHOR.\\ This paper is structured as follows: In section CoLingLab, we present the CoLingLab NER and we show its performance on a sample of PA documents; in section paner we describe the adaptation of the system to PA texts and its performances (section performances). In section relations, we report on the annotation of relations that we performed on a sample of the corpus and finally discuss the results and ongoing work.","Named entities play an important role in administrative acts, especially in those - like the documents in the Albo Pretorio - describing the main actions taken by Municipalities. This kind of information is very useful to fullfil the obligations related to supervisory monitoring, disclosure, periodic self-assessment, and review of the government decisions. In this paper, we presented a NER for PA that shows a significant ability to identify the relevant entities, and in particular legislative reference and connected acts. It is important to stress the lexical and syntactic complexity of bureaucratic language represents a big challenge for NLP tools and methods. Such a complexity derives from the technical lexis of other domain-specific languages with which PA deals daily, such as education, environment, ICT technologies, public health and so on. In near feature we plan to explore the possibility of re-engineering our system to take advantage of new algorithms for entity extraction such as neural networks and in particular from character level word embeddings.

The task consists in labelling death certificates, in French with international standard codes. In particular, we wanted to accomplish the goal of the `Replication track' of this Task which promotes the sharing of tools and the dissemination of solid, reproducible results.""","When researchers use `traditional' methods of scientific publication to describe computational research, we, as readers and researchers, may incur into the so-called `reproducible research' problem AUTHOR. For example, a traditional conference paper usually specifies the relevant computations of the main approach, because the limitations of a paper medium prohibit a complete documentation, which would ideally include experimental data, parameter values, and the source code of the program. Those readers who wish to use the same approach of the paper, hence reproduce the results, must reimplement the whole process, which sometimes may be an unfeasible task. The extreme of reproducibility is `replicability', i.e. a perfect replica of a scientific experiment. The discussion of the difference between replicability and reproducibility is beyond the scope of this paper AUTHOR, and we will just point out that, in general, even in the most accurate replica of an experiment will be done by a different person, in a different lab, using different equipment. Researchers of different areas have identifyied the necessity for reproducibility, or reproducible research, as an attainable minimum standard for assessing the value of scientific claims AUTHOR. As Roger Peng suggests, ``one aim of the reproducibility standard is to fill the gap in the scientific evidence-generating process between full replication of a study and no replication. Between these two extreme end points, there is a spectrum of possibilities, and a study may be more or less reproducible than another depending on what data and code are made available''. Reproducibility matters because the lack of reproducibility in science causes significant issues for science itself, for other researchers in the community, and for public policy. For example, Nature published a special issue about ``Challenges in Irreproducible Research''} where the examined cases showed that there is [ \dots ] a growing alarm about results that cannot be reproduced. Explanations include increased levels of scrutiny, complexity of experiments and statistics, and pressures on researchers. Journals, scientists, institutions and funders all have a part in tackling reproducibility. Among many other problems, the article showed that most of the drug validation studies (43 out of 67 studies) failed to reproduce. Another important case concerned Science, where the Editor-in-Chief retracted in 2015 a study of how canvassers can sway people's opinions about gay marriage because: `` (i) Survey incentives were misrepresented [ \dots ], (ii) The statement on sponsorship was false. [ \dots ]'' There are also cases of papers retracted by authors themselves because ``After carefully re-examining the data presented in the article, they identified that data of two different hospitals got terribly mixed. The published results cannot be reproduced in accordance with scientific and clinical correctness.'' as declared in the note of retraction of the paper ``Low Dose Lidocaine for Refractory Seizures in Preterm Neonates'' AUTHOR.","The aim of this work was to continue the work on the reproducible research approach that can be used as a baseline for further experiments. The performance of the system that uses a semi-manual spell-checking approach improved the baseline set by the original paper. The documentation produced for the reproducibility approach helped us to spot bugs during the implementation phase and we strongly believe that this type of actions should be supported more and more because, as reported by the analysis who tested the systems at CLEF eHealth “[ . . . ] still experienced varying degrees of difficulty to install and run the systems. [ . . . ] Analysts also report that additional information on system requirements, installation procedure and practical use would be useful for all the systems submitted, although documentation was overall more abundant and detailed compared to last year’s experiments.

The obtained results show a correlation between the editing extent and the compliance to some specific linguistic features, suggesting that supporting translators in writing translations following a desired style may actually reduce the number of following necessary interventions (and, consequently, save time) by revisors, editors and curators.","The Progetto Traduzione Talmud Babilonese (PTTB) is a research and education project carrying out the digitized Italian translation of the Babylonian Talmud (BT), a fundamental book of the Jewish tradition, covering every aspect of human knowledge: law, science, philosophy, religion and even aspects of everyday life. The translation of the Talmud has been assigned to more than 50 scholars comprising expert translators, trainee translators, instructors, editors and curators. The translated text is accompanied by the explanations and comments on specific words and subjects, and also by illustrative sheets for the various scientific, historical and linguistic topics addressed inside the Talmudic discussions. However, the Project objectives include more than the translation of the Talmud: the whole work has been set up to be completely digital. Everything, from the very first activities of assigning users to the translation of specific chapters to supporting in the definition of the final printing layout, revolves around Traduco, a collaborative web-based Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) tool developed within the Project. Today, many CAT tools, both commercial and freely distributed, are already available, but they have been designed for the translation of technical manuals or domain-specific texts (legislative, medical) with the main purpose of speeding up the translation process. The BT is a very complex text in many ways: its content, the different, ancient, languages it is composed of (though mainly Babylonian Aramaic and Mishnaic Hebrew), and the history of its composition over the centuries. For these reasons, the approach we adopted for the development of Traduco had to take into account the needs of translators working on a text with very particular interpretative issues. Traduco allows a user to distinguish the literal part of the translation (in bold, see Fig.fig:lifeCycle) from explicative additions, included by translators to make the most difficult passages clearer to readers. Indeed, a full understanding of this kind of texts requires a translation to be enriched with comments, notes, and glossary entries. Furthermore, due to the complexity of the inner structure of the BT, Traduco allows users to split autonomously their translations into ``strings'' (representing, typically, a sentence, see Fig.fig:lifeCycle), gathered into ``logical units'' . Finally, Traduco provides a collaborative and training environment allowing a translator to instantly consult translations done by others, when portions of text (and sometimes even a single word) are difficult to interpret and translate. For a comprehensive description of how Traduco works refer to AUTHOR. The size and complexity of the text and the need to produce a printed version of the BT translation, required a team of users composed of translators, revisors, editors, curators and supervisors. The whole translation workflow can be described by following the ``life-cycle'' of each string (Fig.fig:lifeCycle). It all starts as soon as the coordinator of the translation assigns a chapter to a specific translator: the first phase of the work, the translation, begins. The translation is carried out by scholars having two distinct profiles: expert translators, working autonomously, and trainee translators, these latter being constantly supported by instructors monitoring online their work and providing face-to-face lectures. Once the translation of a specific chapter is concluded, the revision phase starts. Revisors are chosen among the most expert scholars involved in the Project and their main task is to verify if translators have understood correctly the meaning of each string. They also have to check if the domain terms (if present) have been appropriately annotated and explained in the relative glossary entry. After the content has been revised, the editing starts. In this phase, a formal and linguistic control of the translation is carried out, where the editors ensure that the translated strings are syntactically and orthographically correct. Contextually, each string can be enriched, if needed to help in the understanding of the text, with pictures and tables. The last phase is the curatorship, during which one more general control of the translation is done before proceeding with the final exporting and printing of the volume. As we showed in a previous work AUTHOR, the introduction of Natural Language Processing techniques in CAT tools can bring concrete advantages to the translation work and pave the way to innovative research in the area of NLP for Digital Humanities. One way to ease the translation of a text as the BT is to assist translators in writing, in the first place, good translations requiring as few corrections as possible by revisors, editors and curators. In other words, we want to find a way of alerting a user about to submit a new translation by highlighting specific characteristics of the sentence that may further require a revision and, thus, slow down the overall translation process. To do that, we chose to experiment the application of stylometric measures to Italian translations. The assumption we would like to prove is that translations being more compliant to the style of revisors will actually require less revisions. If that will be demonstrated, we may develop a strategy to alert translators of potential ``unfit'' translations and suggest a way to improve them in order to minimize the following editing for revision, editing, and curatorship.","The experiment described in this paper proves that the application of NLP to CAT contexts can open new research perspectives and, more importantly, may be of concrete help in real usage translation scenarios. The proposed methodology can be applied, in principle, to any translation project in which a revision phase is a part of the whole translation workflow and where an history of the edits is maintained. The same analysis could be performed on different languages depending solely on the availability of the suitable NLP tools. Some of the NLP techniques adopted for the stylometric analysis of Italian may also be adapted to the processing of Mishnaic Hebrew and Aramaic (the main source languages). The automatic linguistic analysis of Mishnaic Hebrew, for example, is being experimented AUTHOR. However, an analysis of the style (or complexity) of the source text, though interesting in a historical text analysis perspective, would be pointless in the specific context of revision support in computer-assisted translation. The correlation we found between the revision measures and some linguistic features (some of which are actually used as indicators of linguistic complexity) is the first step towards the design of a technique aimed at providing users a way of writing translations less prone to revisions. In this way, the whole translation workflow would benefit from a reduced time in the revision, editing and curatorship phases. Once the approach will be defined, the relative software will be implemented as a new component of Traduco. Moreover, the possibility of suggesting a way of writing ``better'' translations (at least wrt revisor's style) will be exploited in the education of trainee translators.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The final result of the annotation represents a first step toward a corpus of discourse relations for Italian, compatible with the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) project AUTHOR, the largest and the most used corpus annotated with discourse relations in the NLP field. A number of annotated corpora similar to the PDTB have been realised since its creation, for instance, the Prague Discourse TreeBank AUTHOR), the Chinese Discourse TreeBank AUTHOR), the Leeds Arabic Discourse TreeBank AUTHOR). propose an overview of projects also mentioning resources for French, Turkish and Hindi. For Italian, a similar attempt was proposed by AUTHOR, which uses the PDTB scheme for the annotation of the LUNA conversational spoken dialogue corpus. The authors annotated 60 real dialogues in the domain of software/hardware troubleshooting. Another project for Italian inspired by the PDTB is proposed by Pareti and Prodanof AUTHOR and it is focused on the relation of attribution, i.e ``the relation of “ownership” between abstract objects and individuals or agents'' AUTHOR. Resources manually annotated with discourse relation have been used for instance for developing methods and tools for the automatic identification and disambiguation of explicit marked or implicitly conveyed discourse relationsThe task of identifying discourse relations in the form of a discourse connective taking two arguments is also called shallow discourse parsing and constituted a shared task of the CONLL conference in 2015 and 2016 AUTHOR, for the identification of the spans of text that are linked by relations (discourse segmentation), for the automatic creation of a summary of a written text (text summarization) AUTHOR, and for machine translation AUTHOR. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the contrast relation; Section 3 describes the annotation guidelines; Section 4 presents the content of the resource and Section 5 discusses the inter annotator agreement.","We presented Contrast-Ita Bank, a corpus annotated with discourse contrast relations in Italian. Following the PDTB annotation schema, we annotated explicit, implicit and altelex relations of contrast. We also present the list of connectives that convey contrast in the corpus. The new resource can be integrated with LICO, the Lexicon of Italian Connectives AUTHOR, validating the list of connectives and adding examples from corpus to the connectives.

Passaro, Alessandro Lenci",Emo2Val: Inferring Valence Scores from fine-grained Emotion Values,ENG,3,1,0,Università di Pisa,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"This paper studies the relationship between the valence, one of the psycholinguistic variables in the Italian version of ANEW AUTHOR, and emotive scores calculated by exploiting distributional methods AUTHOR. We show two methods to infer valence from fine grained emotions and discuss their evaluation.","Recent years have seen a surge in studies concerning emotional ratings, both in psycholinguistics and in affective computing. Traditionally, the three main behavioral dimensions to measure the emotional value of a word are valence, arousal and dominance. AUTHOR define valence as the ``pleasantness of the stimulus'', usually ranging from 1 (very unpleasant) to 9 (very pleasant). The word dead has a low valence rating, whereas holiday has a higher one. Arousal is the intensity of the feeling evoked on a scale from ``stimulated'' to ``unaroused''. A highly stimulating word is passion. On the contrary, sleep is not arousing. Finally, dominance is identified with the degree to which the stimulus makes the reader feel ``in control'' AUTHOR. Victory is a word with high dominance. In the domain of Affective Computing, the goal moves from the identification of such variables to the annotation of the texts with the emotions they express and - for Sentiment Analysis - with their degree of positivity and/or negativity. The aim of this work is to study the relationship between the most important psycholinguistic variables and emotive scores calculated by exploiting distributional methods. In particular, we will focus on valence ratings, assuming that, within these three dimensions, valence is the most highly related with a positive, negative or neutral emotional content. In fact, it can be defined as the ``the polarity of emotional activation'' AUTHOR. A possible approach to infer the valence of the words from co-occurrence statistics is the one adopted by AUTHOR, who followed a bootstrapping method to extend the ANEW lexicon AUTHOR. Another approach would be to exploit a resource such as SenticNet AUTHOR to infer valence based on values of polarity for words or conceptual primitives. An alternative strategy is to infer the valence from an emotive lexicon such as ItEM AUTHOR, a distributional lexicon for Italian, in which words are associated with an emotive score for 8 different emotions. In our opinion, this solution has several advantages: first of all, ItEM has been proven to be quite robust, and guarantees high coverage over Italian words; secondly, it is not only a static resource, but it can be easily expanded with new words, allowing for a quick adaptation to different contexts. Finally, associating words with fine-grained emotional values allows for a wide range of analyses, such as for instance hate and violence detection in texts. Experimental results showed, in an indirect way, that distributional emotive ratings can be very useful in the implementation of systems for polarity classification AUTHOR. However, what is the real relation between emotive scores and valence? Our hypothesis is that emotions can be seen as a representation of valence on a more granular scale. The Plutchik's emotion taxonomy AUTHOR is partitioned into positive or negative emotions. However, borderline emotions such as \textsc{Surprise} are harder to be included into a positive or negative class, and therefore to be attributed with a direct valence rating. Words like party and gun will have widely differing valence ratings, but both strongly elicit the emotion of \textsc{Surprise}. Hence it is interesting to ask the following question: given ItEM, are we able to predict the valence (i.e., positivity and/or negativity) of its words? In order to address this latter point, we performed a simple regression model to predict the valence ratings of words in ANEW AUTHOR given the respective emotive values in ItEM AUTHOR. This paper is organized as follow: in Section sec:resources we describe the resources used for the creation of the model. Section sec:From fine-grained Emotion Values to Polatity shows our method and the results obtained. Finally, in Section sec:resultAndDiscussion we evaluate the results and discuss our findings.","In this work we studied the relationship between valence and distributional emotive scores. We modeled our data with regression in order to predict both a continuous score for valence and its corresponding binarized version (i.e., polarity). Despite the difficulties of modeling an accurate representation of a continuous valence rating from a small and unbalanced dataset like the Italian ANEW, we can identify a clear relationship between distributional emotional scores and a discrete valence obtained by categorizing the ratings into a positive and a negative class. In the near future, we plan to improve our regression models, with the aim of reducing the impact of the distribution of the data in ANEW, possibly implementing new strategies able to cope with non linear data. ANEW is a highly renown psycholinguistic dataset, but we plan to extend the present work to predict sentiment polarity scores taken from SentiWordNet AUTHOR, thereby exploiting the larger coverage of this resource. Moreover, we plan to follow the approach employed in ItEM to create a polarity lexicon for Italian, using ANEW words as seed to build positive and negative polarity centroids. This would also be beneficial for evaluating performances on a emotion-based approach and a polarity-based one. Finally, we aim at testing the effectiveness of our system for Sentiment Polarity Classification.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

However, NMT systems are limited in translating low-resource languages (LRL), due to the fact that neural methods require a large amount of parallel data to learn effective mappings between languages. In this work we show how so-called multilingual NMT can help to tackle the challenges associated with LRL translation. Multilingual NMT forces words and sub-words representation in a shared semantic space across multiple languages. This allows the model to utilize a positive parameter transfer between different languages, without changing the standard attention-based encoder-decoder architecture and training modality.} We run preliminary experiments with three languages (English, Italian, Romanian) covering six translation directions and show that for all available directions the multilingual approach, i.e. just one system covering all directions is comparable or even outperforms the single bilingual systems. Finally, our approach achieve competitive results also for language pairs not seen at training time using a pivoting (x-step) translation.","Neural machine translation (NMT) has recently shown its effectiveness by delivering the best performance in various evaluation campaigns (IWSLT 2016 AUTHOR, WMT 2016 AUTHOR).} Unlike rule-based or phrase-based MT, the end-to-end learning approach of NMT models the mapping from source to target language directly through a posterior probability}. The basic component of an NMT system include an encoder, a decoder and an attention mechanism AUTHOR.

For this reason,} building effective NMT systems} for low-resourced languages becomes a} primary challenge AUTHOR. Recently, AUTHOR showed how a standard string-to-tree statistical MT system AUTHOR can effectively outperform NMT methods for low-resource} languages, such as Hausa, Uzbek, and Urdu. In this work, we focus on a so-called multilingual NMT AUTHOR, which considers the use of NMT to target many-to-many language translation. Our motivation is that intensive cross-lingual transfer AUTHOR via parameter sharing should ideally help in the case of similar languages and sparse training data. Hence, in this work we investigate multilingual NMT across Italian, Romanian, and English, and simulate low-resource conditions by limiting the amount of parallel data. Our approach showed a BLEU increase in various language directions, in a low-resource setting. To compare a single language pair NMT models with a single multilingual NMT (M-NMT) model, we considered six translation directions (i.e English\leftrightarrowItalian, English\leftrightarrowRomanian, and Italian\leftrightarrowRomanian). For evaluating the zero-shot translation (i.e. a translation between language pair with no available parallel corpus), we removed the (Italian\leftrightarrowRomanian) language pairs. In the same way as the six-language-pairs, the performance of the four-language-pairs M-NMT model is comparable with the bilingual models for the language directions with parallel data. We start in Section 2 with a brief description of NMT and state-of-the-art multilingual NMT approaches. In Section 3, we give a background on our M-NMT model. In Section 4, we present the experimental setting and the NMT model configurations. In Section 5, we show and discuss the results of the experiments. Finally, in Section 6 we present our conclusion and future works.","In this paper, we used a multilingual NMT model in a low-resource language pairs scenario. We showed that a single multilingual system achieves comparable performances with the bilingual baselines while avoiding the need to train several single language pair models. Then, we showed how a multilingual model can be used for zero-shot translation by using a pivot language for achieving slightly lower results than a bilingual model trained on that language pair. As a future work we want to explore how the choice of different languages can enable a better parameter transfer in a single model, using more linguistic features of the surface word form, and how to achieve a direct zero-shot translation in a low-resource scenario without the pivoting mechanism.",10,Machine Translation

A gold standard of the target data was annotated in order to evaluate some data-driven tools, trained on contemporary web news. Results are reported and discussed.","A constantly increasing amount of digital texts of the German literary history is freely available online as downloadable raw texts, especially thanks to important ongoing projects, such as deutschestextarchiv.de or zeno.org, to name but a few. In spite of this, we still lack annotated corpora gathering them per author and genre. Indeed, this is a strong bottleneck in exploiting such textual treasure for linguistic analysis through computational methods. At the same time, available training data for data-driven annotation tools mainly come from the domain of contemporary web news. Therefore, models have to be trained on this particular variety of the German language, which could be very different, in terms of linguistic features, from the target unannotated data. Such variation between the training set and the test set could cause tools' performances to drop AUTHOR. Therefore, testing such models on a portion of the target texts is crucial. On the one hand, to show their robustness. On the other hand, more practically, to understand to what extent available tools can actually boost the semi-automatic annotation of new data.\\ In this paper, I will highlight the methodology behind the development of a first sample of a dependency treebank aiming to collect German aesthetic essays of the late 18\textsuperscript{th} century. By aesthetic essays I mean theoretical writings about art, poetics, beauty and related issues, which were mainly published on literary magazines, chiefly targeting non-academic middle-class readers. In that period, there was a remarkable production of these texts in Germany, and they contributed to popularize the recently born modern 'Hochdeutsch', i.e. the modern variety of the German language. To the best of my knowledge, despite its importance, such textual genre has never been studied in depth at any linguistic level. In a long-term perspective, a dependency treebank will surely provide empirical data to fill the gap, especially concerning syntax and semantics. Indeed, many studies can be done on such resource, ranging from using dependency networks to describe syntactic phenomena AUTHOR, to extracting a valency lexicon AUTHOR.\\ In the rest of this paper, some fundamental issues concerning the treebank design are highlighted and preliminary results concerning automatic lemmatization, POS-tagging and dependency parsing are reported and discussed.","In this work, I described the methodology behind the development of a first sample of a German treebank collecting a particular kind of aesthetic essays from the late 18th century, called fragments. A gold standard was annotated adhering to UD 2.0. Then some data-driven tools were tested either on the target data and on a test set of the source variety. Some core issues concerning the automatic annotation were highlighted. As for LEMMA and XPOS, overall accuracy on the target data was high and very close to that on the source variety. As for UPOS, the accuracy by the best tagger dropped, especially on the target data. Therefore, to assign POS-tag, the very good results on the STTS tagset may suggest to automatically assign XPOS first and then derive UPOS from XPOS. Furthermore, the influence of POS-tagging granularity on parsing has not been studied yet. As for dependency parsing, the overall gap between the target variety and the source variety was remarkable (19%). An in-depth comparison between the two varieties concerning single relations will surely help to better detect parsing problems on fragments. In addition, parsing manually lemmatized and POS-tagged texts will surely shed light on the error propagation on parsing.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

A distributed model, where nodes independently interact with the environment, may provide a widespread support for both users and other devices. In the latter setup, each entity has a partial awareness about defines the requests accepted by the network, and this aspect complicates the task. This paper improves an existing distributed model, called PHASER, by proposing linguistic analysis techniques to manage non-matching requests. NLP methods produce a confidence; any PHASER node forwards non-matching requests to close peers. PHASER exploits the confidence to rank the adjacent peers and deliver the question to the best node. Partial Matching and a Bag-of-Words models will be compared with the currently adopted full matching. The Bag-of-Words approach offered the best results in terms of both quality and required time.","This paper introduces a new distributed approach to question answering and command execution in different Intelligent Environments (henceforth IE). This idea is rarely encountered in literature (with a few exceptions by AUTHOR). IE is a new discipline including Domotic, Internet of Things, Cultural Heritage Technological Innovation and other similar issues. In our approach, devices in the environments constitute nodes of a network and this network provides services to an interacting user. Reasons of interests for NLP studies in this kind of application lie in the idea that user requests are delivered using Natural Language (mainly speech) in the simplest case, or multimodally by integrating speech with gestures and interaction with physical controls. Nowadays, smart devices commonly propose interaction through natural language to the users. As the services offer becomes wider, a network of specialised applications managing very specific domains is masked behind a single named character (Alexa, Siri, Cortana). While this is common for single devices hosting multiple applications, which inform the operating system about their capabilities through dedicated languages (e.g. SRGS, AUTHOR), the model is being transferred to networks of different devices. Optimising the communication between these devices is a critical issue to reduce response times, balance communication and improve quality of service. In this paper, we will concentrate on showing how the confidence metric, commonly available in NLP techniques, can be exploited to support rapid adaptation of the network to request dispatching, avoiding broadcasting. We will mainly describe the simplest case of speech interaction and understanding; for a view on the complex multimodal approach, please refer to AUTHOR. Given these premises, nodes in the given network are able to respond to simple questions or commands uttered by the user. In a first approach, utterances should conserve a coherence with the ``nature'' of the node, i.e. if I am ``talking'' to the kitchen or to the microwave oven, I should make requests strictly inherent with the device functions. On the contrary, we wish to expand the ``intelligence'' of the environment giving to the user the possibility to make any kind of requirements to any node in the network. In this view, each node is able to classify the string deriving by the speech utterance assigning it to one of the many classes of relevant action the environment can realise, even if the node itself is not able to execute that action. The introduction of a distributed knowledge base and of network information spreading techniques concur to the realisation of an environment extremely reactive, scalable and easily configurable for different domains. The system is reactive as the network connections are strongly optimised: redundant and rarely used paths are pruned. Mechanisms for knowledge distribution are optimised in order to deliver the proper answer minimising network reaction times. The system is easily configurable to different domains as this kind of networks just require a formal description of the semantics of each node, of the action classes they are able to process, and of the most probable connection among nodes that a-priori the environment designer implements. In order to realise this system, many NLP software modules are needed, and among these: an automatic spoken dialogue manager, a Spoken Language Understanding system, an ontology modelling the environment and the devices. An extended description of each part can be found in AUTHOR; this paper focuses on a linguistic analysis to improve the navigation of the request through the network. In Section sec:related we present related works; Section sec:model recalls the model of our system. In Section sec:navigation we discuss a network of interactive entities, highlighting differences about the current version and the contribution of this paper. Experiments and Discussion are presented in Sections sec:experiment and sec:discussion. Section sec:conclusion concludes the paper.","This paper presented PHASER, a distributed model for Human-Computer Interaction in Intelligent Environments. This work aims at improving the Navigation Problem, where a node forwards a received command if it is not able to understand or process it. Since the node operates with partial knowledge about both the request and the environment, it tries to analyse the input and choose the best adjacent node. The most crucial part is not a refined linguistic analysis of each request, but a quick confidence on how much each adjacent node could be a good candidate to understand that request. This requirement is motivated by two reasons: (i) this process is part of a longer step where a user is waiting for a response; (ii) all the evaluations rely on information each node shares with others. In order to deeply understand the command, the node should expose sensible data and it is not always desired in a distributed context. The work focused on three strategies: perfect and partial matches with regular expressions and a bag-of-words model. This last approach has given the best results with positive aspects mainly related to easy network design and security of each node. The investigated methods are just used to rank close peers on as an out-of-context request reaches the current node. It operates without understanding the request, so finer considerations are not possible. The considered approaches do not limit PHASER nodes in adopting more refined techniques in assessing and categorising an input request.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

When dealing with social media data, the shortness of text and the extraction of the statement from his context usually makes it hard to understand irony even for humans but especially for machines. In this paper we propose an analysis of the role that textual information plays in the perception and construction of irony in short texts like tweets. We will focus on the impact of conventional expedients of digital writing, which seem to represent a substitution of typical gestures and tones of oral communication, in figurative interpretation of messages in Italian language. Elaborated computational model has been exploited in the development of an irony detection system, which has been evaluated in the Sentipolc's shared task at EVALITA 2016.","The growing scientific interest on natural language understanding has been supported in the last decade by a great amount of user-generated texts available on the Web. People usually use social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, to express their opinions on different topics, which can be exploited, for example, by companies for marketing researches. This is one of the motivations which prompted actual research in this direction on automatic analysis of short-texts. Social micro-texts are great examples of rhetorical production due to their shortness, which supports the creativity of linguistic expressions AUTHOR. In fact 140 characters of tweets encourage users to use some creative devices in order to communicate briefly their opinions or their feelings about events, products, services or other individuals. Among creative devices, irony and sarcasm hinder correct sentiment analysis of texts and, therefore, correct opinion mining. Indeed, irony is a figurative language device used to convey the opposite of literal meaning: contrarium quod dicitur intelligendum est (Quintiliano, Institutio Oratoria, 9, 22-44). In order to express an ironic utterance in short text, users prefer to use conventional expedients in digital writing or particular linguistic constructs which seem to represent a substitution of typical gestures and tones of oral communication. These reveal themselves as good clues for Irony Detection as demonstrated by results obtained with our system participating in SENTIPOLC's at EVALITA 2016 AUTHOR, where we ranked third on twelve participants. In this paper we present linguistic analysis on ironic tweets extracted from corpora used in SENTIPOLC and computational model elaborated in Master's thesis upon which our rule-based system is based.","Although limited amount of Italian ironic examples, this analysis and the results of developed computational system AUTHOR show that people tend to use textual and conventional expedients of oral communication to express irony in informal context as social networks. We can observe this in Figure 1 and 2, where some linguistic constructions expressing tone and accent of user-speaker, like regional expressions and heavy punctuation, are used mainly in ironic tweets. With respect to ironic hashtags we can observe that same hashtags are mentioned in different ironic tweets in both corpora, revealing their important role of established conventional elements in communication in social networks. Finally, in Figure 3 and 4 we can observe that there are cases of incongruity between literal and real meaning, for example there are sentences with negative polarity that contain positive interjections or exclamatory constructions used, indeed, in ironic manner. It is interesting to underline that most of ironic tweets are negative in both corpora: 493 negative ironic tweets on 564 ironic tweets in SENTIPOLC 2014 corpus and 742 on 865 in SENTIPOLC 2016 corpus. In this scenario where automatic irony detection is still challenging for Italian, pragmatic analysis of ironic texts allows to take a closer look at how people use the language and his expedients to express irony.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We report both quantitative data about the tagging and a qualitative analysis of cases of disagreement between two annotators.,"""Words that fill a certain verb argument position are characterised for their semantic properties. For instance, the fillers of the object position of the verb ``eat"""" are typically required to share the fact that they are edible objects, like ``meat"""" and ``bread"""". There has been a vast literature in lexical semantics addressing, under different perspectives, this issue, including the notion of selectional preferences AUTHOR AUTHOR, the notion of prototypical categories AUTHOR, and the notion of lexical sets AUTHOR AUTHOR. However, despite the large theoretical interest, there is still a limited amount of empirical evidences (e.g. annotated corpora) that can be used to support linguistic theories. Particularly, for the Italian language, there has been no systematic attempt to annotate a corpus with semantic tagging of verb argument positions In this paper we assume a corpus-based perspective, and we focus on manually tagging verb argument positions in a corpus with their corresponding semantic classes, selected from those used in the T-PAS resource AUTHOR. We make use of an explicit set of semantic categories (i.e., an ontology of Semantic Types), hierarchically organised (e.g. inanimate subsumes food): we are interested in a qualitative analysis, a rather different perspective with respect to recent works that exploit distributional properties of words filling argument positions AUTHOR. We run a pilot annotation on a corpus of sentences. We aim at investigating how human annotators assign semantic types to argument fillers, and to what extent they agree or disagree. A mid term goal of this work is the extension of the T-PAS resource with a corpus of annotated sentences aligned with the T-PASs of the verbs (see section 2). This would have a twofold impact: it would allow a corpus based linguistic investigation, and it would provide a unique dataset for training semantic parsers for Italian.

This paper describes the analysis of a mapping between two linguistic resources: IMAGACT and T-PAS. The motivation behind this mapping starts with the observation that both resources deal with Italian verbs disambiguation, are corpus-based and contain pieces of information that can be integrated with each other. IMAGACT is a linguistic ontology of actions, that are grouped in concepts and related to different verb Types. For example, the action ``John takes the cup from the shelf"""" belongs to the concept ``take an object"""" and refers to Type 3 of the verb to take. Each Type is also associated to one or more thematic structures (e.g. [AGENT-verb-THEME-SOURCE]) and to videos via a set of captions. T-PAS is a repository of argument typed structures for Italian verbs. Each verb is listed with its structures, which correspond to different senses of the verb. For each structure, the specification of the expected semantic type in every argument position (e.g. for the subject) is provided. In this paper, we describe the results of a first attempt of mapping information between these resources. Specifically, for each of the 248 verbs analysed in both resources, we aim at matching the IMAGACT Types with the corresponding typed argument structures in T-PAS. We operate this mapping by applying a set of rules which convert the information from the argument structure into a thematic-role combination, and find all the Types that match this combination. The linking between argument and thematic structures of a predicate is a debated complex task in linguistic theories AUTHOR. The predictability of thematic roles from argument structure (or viceversa) belongs to the syntax-semantics interface, and a study in this direction is out of the scope of this paper. Our experiment is focused on an empirical analysis of argument and thematic structures in Italian verbs and our aim is to evaluate whether, and to which extent, a rule-based system is able to produce thematic structures. We also intend to verify how these results can be exploited for a mapping purpose. The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present the resources; in Section 3 we describe the mapping procedure; in Section 4 we present and discuss the results of the mapping, tested on a gold standard; in Section 5 we provide direction for future work; in Section 6 we report our conclusions.""","In this paper we presented a first attempt of mapping IMAGACT and T-PAS by using a rule-based algorithm for the automatic conversion of T-PAS semantic types into thematic structures. We took advantage of the strong discriminative power of semantic types in their argument position to reduce the possible set of allowed thematic structures. This approach has an intrinsic limit: thematic roles are determined by verb semantics and their difference is not always reflected in the related semantic type. We also found out that the ts AG-v-TH represents the most critical issue, being the most frequent structure, and appearing in more than one Type of the same verb. The results report a good recall and a low precision, confirming that our algorithm is not able to produce an actual mapping between the two resources, but it provides a reliable set of mapping candidates: we believe that it can be fruitfully exploited for a first step of a mapping process, in order to filter a lot of unwanted matching possibilities. We are confident that by exploiting additional linguistic information from the two resources (e.g. captions and occurrences in IMAGACT, lexical information and examples in T-PAS), the precision of this mapping will improve sensibly.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Works in the areas of Sentiment Analysis AUTHOR, Emotion Detection AUTHOR, and Stance Detection AUTHOR are, on the other hand, only partially related, as they focus on predicting/classifying the content of a message with respect to specific categories, such as ``positive'', ``negative'', ``neutral'', or ``joy'', ``sadness'' (among others), or as ``being in favour'' or ``being against''. They may be seen as necessary but not sufficient tools for detecting/predicting controversy AUTHOR. The main contribution of this work is two-fold: i.) we propose a distant supervised entropy-based model to predict controversial news; and ii.) we present and share an automatically created corpus to train and test models for controversy detection. At this stage of development, we focused only on Italian, although the methods are completely language independent and can be reproduced for any language for which news are available on Facebook. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section~sec:method illustrates the methods used to collect the data and develop the entropy-based model. Section~sec:experiments reports on the experiments and results both in a within- and across-source setting. Finally, Section~sec:conclusion draws conclusions and outlines future research. Data and code are made available at .","This paper presents a simple regression model to predict the entropy of a post's reactions based on the Facebook reaction feature. We take this measure as a proxy to predict the controversy of news, where the higher the entropy (indicated by highly mixed reactions), the bigger the controversy. We run experiments both within and across communities, exemplified by the Facebook pages of specific newspapers. As a by-product, we have also automatically generated a first reference corpus for controversy prediction in Italian. The results are promising, given that our model beats the baseline in almost all cases in cross-validation of same source data (see Table~tab:cross-val), and in the large majority of cases when applied cross-sources (see Table~tab:cross-val2). At this stage of development, we observed that coarse-grained sentiment values are not useful, although this may depend on the quality of the lexicon employed. Test and training on openly biased datasets (e.g. Il Giornale_T_R_A_I_N - Il Manifesto_T_E_S_T, and vice-versa) results in the lowest entropy, suggesting perspective bias in the different community. The approach we have developed is based on discrete linguistically motivated features. This has an impact in the learned model as it is not able to generalise enough when dealing with low-frequency features and unseen data in the test set. To alleviate this issue, we are planning to model the post representations by using word embeddings. We are planning to expand the model to account for perspective bias in different communities. News from different sources may be aggregated per event type, for example via the EventRegistry API}, allowing to explore entropy (and polarisation of reactions) on exactly the same event instance. A first step in this direction would be to detect and match Named Entities to approximately identify similar events. At the reaction-level, the obvious next step is to explore and experiment with clusters of reactions (for instance, positive (LIKE, LOVE, AHAH), negative (ANGRY, SAD), or ambiguous (WOW)), instead of treating them all as single and distinct indicators. Another follow-up is to extend this work to other social media data, such as Twitter. Twitter does not allow for nuances in reactions in the same way that Facebook does, as only one kind of ``like'' is provided. However, the substantial use of hashtags and emojis might offer alternative proxies to capture a variety of reactions. There is plenty of work on the usefulness of leveraging hashtags as reaction proxies both at a coarse and finer level AUTHOR, but this information, to the best of our knowledge, has not been used to predict likelihood of controversy.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

As a philological problem it is no less felt among music historians, often struggling with more or less ancient compositions of uncertain paternity. However, the musicologist lacks useful analytical tools that allow to go beyond the simple subjective impression of listening, while the methodologies of stylistic investigation applied to music up to now have mostly worked at the level of macro-composition genres. It is therefore necessary to identify appropriate analytical methods before dealing with real problems of musical attribution. The application to simple musical repertoires of computational stylistic survey methods (stilo-metry) already verified on verbal texts now offers the first good results, to be tested on more complex compositions, with the necessary modifications. The ultimate aim is not the construction of efficient algorithms for the attribution of musical texts, comparing the absolute effectiveness of the different methods, nor to replace the machine to the ear and discernment of the musicologist, but rather to offer this an instrument of philological investigation in addition that brings out further distinctive traits (features) of the various music, of the various authors, thus allowing him to evaluate stylistic aspects that alone would not perceive.","""The results presented, with exact percentages of recognition around and over 90%, give the hope that the quantitative method of n-grams can validly apply also to more complex musical compositions, characterized by a greater number of overlapping parts,"" and that potentially it is also able to help solve problems of attribution still open among musicologists: to distinguish, for example, the different authors in scores resulting from collaborations, or to evaluate the degree of reliability of the attribution of a composition of uncertain paternity. It would then be interesting to find out what results are obtained if the calculated n-grams are processed as features by a supervised classifier (e.g. an SVM with 10-fold cross-validation), or which features are selected by other algorithms. Recently the use of character-level embeddings and convolutional neural networks has also shown good potential in attribution problems (AUTHOR, AUTHOR): the effectiveness on musical texts remains to be verified. In order to maintain high levels of recognition, however, music must always be simplified as much as possible, keeping in quantitative analysis only those components that can effectively discriminate against the problem examined, assessed from time to time.

Our approach is based on (i) a search engine to retrieve previously answered question candidates and (ii) kernel methods applied to advanced linguistic structures to rerank the most promising candidates. We show that methods developed for cQA work well also when applied to data generated in customer service scenarios, where the user seeks for explanation about products and a database of previously answered questions is available. The experiments with our system demonstrate its suitability for an industrial scenario.","In recent years, open-domain Question Answering (QA) has been more and more used by large companies, e.g., IBM, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc., for their commercial applications. However, medium and smaller enterprises typically cannot invest billions of dollars in achieving the desired QA accuracy: this limits the use of this technology, especially, in case of less supported languages, e.g., Italian. One viable alternative for smaller companies is the design of close-domain systems looking for answers in specific data. For example, most companies require to quickly and accurately search their own documentation or the one of their customers, which are often available in terms of unstructured text. However, even this scenario is complicated as reaching the a satisfactory accuracy may require a lot of resources. An interesting alternative is provided by cQA technology, which uses techniques tailored for answering questions in specific forums. In addition, to the intuitive observation that the forum topics are rather restricted, making the retrieval task easier, cQA offers an even more interesting property: when a new question is asked in a forum, instead of searching for an answer, the system tries to look for a similar question. Indeed, similar questions were asked before and may have received answers, thus the system can provide the users with such responses. The main advantage of this approach is that searching for similar questions is much easier than searching for text answering a given question. \antonio{Due to this, challenges such as SemEval-2017 Task 3 AUTHOR and QA4FAQ AUTHOR, aimed at testing current cQA available technology, have been organized}. In this paper, we show that help desk applications, generally required by most companies, can adopt the cQA model to automatize the answering process. In particular, we describe our QA system developed for RGI, which is a software vendor specialized in the insurance businesses. One important task carried out by their help desk software regards answering customers' questions using a ticket system. Already answered tickets are stored in specialized databases but manually finding and routing them to the users is time consuming. We show that our approach, using standard search engines and advanced reranker based on machine learning and NLP technology, can achieve answer recall of almost 85% when considering the top three retrieved tickets. This is particularly interesting because the experimented data and models are completely in Italian, demonstrating the maturity of this technology also for this language.","In this paper, we have described our experience in building a QA model for an Italian help desk in the field of insurance policies.

The annotation is rigorously evaluated by means of a newly developed strategy based on the alignment of the entire epistemic constructions as identified and marked up two annotators. The corpus and the agreement scoring tools are publicly available.","Modality is a pervasive phenomenon crucial to language understanding, analysis, and automatic processing AUTHOR. The creation of modality-annotated data would benefit Natural Language Processing in at least two major aspects: (i) factuality detection, consisting in the automatic distinction between propositions that represent factual events and propositions that represent non factual ones; and (ii) sentiment analysis, which involve the processing of extra-propositional aspects of meaning and the detection of polarised judgements. Additionally, the annotation of modality may also have important repercussions in the field of corpus linguistics, as the techniques developed in the automatic treatment of modality can be used to improve our linguistic knowledge of modality itself. As far as the detection of polarised judgments goes, there have been substantial annotation efforts in recent years, exemplified by recurring and increasing sentiment analysis tasks within the context of the Semeval evaluation campaign.. Note that in 2017 within the sentiment analysis track there was also a task on truth detection, which goes to show how closely related the two phenomena indeed are.} Attention has also been given to more specific factuality tasks such as the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task on identifying hedges AUTHOR, and factuality annotation in languages other than English, such as Italian AUTHOR, and Dutch AUTHOR. However, these are annotation efforts involving specific phenomena rather than modality in general. Indeed, a major bottleneck in the creation of modality-annotated resources is the very notion of modality itself, as encapsulating this phenomenon in one exhaustive but workable definition is far from trivial AUTHOR. Building on the function-based proposal advanced in AUTHOR and AUTHOR, we have created a comprehensive annotation scheme for epistemic modality and have applied it to multiple languages. Contextually, we have developed and deployed an evaluation strategy which shows that the corpus is annotated reliably. \paragraph{Summary of contributions} We produced the first multilingual corpus annotated for modality.

With this approach, we have produced the first multilingual corpus annotated for modality, which can be potentially used to train modality detection models as well as to further study modality itself. By making all of the data publicly available, and by sharing our annotation experience, we also hope to provide a blueprint for creating modality-annotated resources in yet more languages.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Datasets (development, training and test data) are being developed for different languages and different domains, both for research and industrial purposes. A relevant consequence of this is the increasing demand for annotated datasets, both in terms of quantity and quality. This in turn calls for tools with a rich apparatus of functionalities (e.g. annotation, visualization, monitoring and reporting), able to support and monitor a large variety of annotators (i.e. from linguists to mechanical turkers), flexible enough to serve a large spectrum of annotation scenarios (e.g. crowdsourcing and paid professional annotators), and open to the integration of %classification NLP tools (e.g. for automatic pre-annotation and for instance selection based on Active Learning).

The final aim is to build a novel resource from the filtering applied to the existing lexical resources, which can integrate them with missing lexical entries and more reliable associations of polarity with entries.","Sentiment Analysis (SA), described as the task of automatically determine the polarity in a given piece of text AUTHOR, is currently among the most widely investigated topics within NLP. Overall, the approaches for addressing such task are mainly based on techniques ranging from traditional machine learning to novel deep learning ones, as it can be seen also in the context of shared tasks on sentiment polarity classification in Twitter recently proposed, respectively for English AUTHOR and Italian AUTHOR, within the SemEval and Evalita periodical evaluation campaigns. Moreover, the detection of specific words associated with polarity values or emotions has been considered as a powerful information source for identifying the sentiment behind a text. Among the resources which are more commonly exploited by SA systems for performing their task there are therefore sentiment lexica, i.e., lists of words with associated polarity values or emotions. Several techniques have been applied for the development of lexical resources for SA: they can be built from scratch, manually or automatically, or extracted from corpora AUTHOR. Nevertheless, the vast majority of these resources are written in English, and a lack of resources currently features several other languages. One of the most commonly applied alternatives for having resources in language other than English is to automatically translate some available English lexicon via tools such as Google translate }. But there are many constraints involved in this kind of process, such as handling synonyms and polysemous words, multi-word expressions, but also to deal with cultural differences between source and target language. Apart from this, possible variations of polarity across different contexts and languages should be carefully taken into account, while such approaches rely somehow on the assumption that affective norms related to sentiment are stable across languages. In this paper we are interested into evaluate the reliability of the lexical resources currently available for Italian SA and, providing that the most of them are obtained by translation, we will mainly focus on the reliability of automatically translating English resources to Italian language. For doing so, we carried out a methodology involving different facets. %\\ Our final aim is to develop a new SA resource for Italian, which comprises pre-existing translated lexical entries enriched with the manual correction of the polarity assigned, as resulting from our analysis, but also includes entries which are featured by a polarity but are missing in the available lexica.

In the next section, we describe our methodology which mainly consists in three steps: the selection of a sample of tweets from an Italian sentiment corpus and exploited as part of the gold standard in the Sentipolc@Evalita2016 shared task AUTHOR; automatic extraction of the lexical entries polarized according to a set of benchmark sentiment lexica for Italian; the analysis of these entries and the comparison with those expected by a human judge. Section three shows instead an extrinsic evaluation of the impact of the detected errors on the results of the SA system. Some hints about future development of this research are given in the conclusion.","In this paper we propose the preliminary investigation about a methodology for the development of a novel lexical resource for Italian SA, namely polarITA, which takes advantage of the analysis and filtering of errors occurring in the available lexical resources. We carried out a manual analysis of a set of tweets for determining the reliability of sentiment-related lexica, showing that, even if the transfer of lexical information between two different languages is a common practice to address the lack of resources, information related to sentiment is lost during it. The identified errors are then exploited as a starting point for developing the novel resource.\\ As future work, we are planning to extend the resource in several directions: by investigating multi-word expressions, extending the coverage to a larger corpus, exploring the impact of figurative language devices such as irony and sarcasm in the use of certain polarized words AUTHOR.

Furthermore, a manual analysis of the terms is carried out. Results suggest that in some cases - despite the simplistic approach implemented to inject terms into the MT system - the termbase was able to bias the word choice of the engine.","Availability of {course unit descriptions or course catalogues} in multiple languages has started to play a key role for universities especially after the Bologna process AUTHOR and the resulting growth in student mobility.~These texts aim at providing students with all the relevant information regarding contents, pre-requisites, learning outcomes, etc. Since course unit descriptions have to be drafted in large quantities on a yearly basis, universities would benefit from the use of machine translation (MT).~Indeed, the importance of developing MT tools in this domain is further testified by two previous projects funded by the EU Commission, i.e.~TraMOOC} and Bologna Translation Service}. The former differs from the present work since it does not focus on academic courses, while the latter does not seem to have undergone substantial development after 2013 and in addition to that, it does not include the Italian-English language combination. Automatically producing multilingual versions of course unit descriptions poses a number of challenges.~A first major issue for MT systems is the scarcity of high quality human-translated parallel texts of course unit descriptions. Also, descriptions feature not only terms that are typical of institutional academic communication, but also expressions that belong to specific disciplines AUTHOR. This makes it cumbersome to choose the right resources and the most effective method to add them to the MT engine. For this study, we chose to concentrate on course units belonging to the disciplinary domain of exact sciences, since Italian degree programmes whose course units belong to this domain translate their contents into English more often than other programmes. A phrase-based statistical machine translation system (PBSMT) was used to translate course unit descriptions from Italian into English. We trained one engine on a subset of the Europarl corpus and on a small in-domain corpus including course unit descriptions and degree programs (see sect.~Subsection3.2) belonging to the domain of the exact sciences. Then, we enriched the training data set with a bilingual terminology database belonging to the educational domain (see sect.~Subsection3.3) and built a new engine. To assess the overall performance of the two systems we automatically evaluated them with the BLEU score. We then focused on the evaluation of terminology translation, by computing the f-score on the list of termbase entries occurring both in the system outputs and in the reference translation (see sect.~results). Finally, to gather more information on term translation, a manual analysis was carried out (see sect. sect:ManualEvaluation).","This paper has described a preliminary analysis aimed at assessing the use of in-domain terminology in PBSMT in the institutional academic domain, and more precisely for the translation of course unit descriptions from Italian into English. Following the results of the present experiment and given its preliminary nature, we are planning to carry out further work in this field. In section results we have seen that the institutional academic terms contained in our testing data also appeared in the training data, thus limiting the impact of terminology on the output. However, course catalogues and course unit descriptions include terms belonging to the specific disciplines (see sect.~intro) as well. In our future works we are therefore planning to focus not only on academic terminology, but also on the disciplinary one testing its impact on the output of an MT engine translating course unit descriptions. After this first experiment on the widely-used PBSMT architecture,~in future work we are planning to exploit neural machine translation (NMT).~In particular, our goal is to develop an NMT engine able to handle terminology correctly in this text domain, in order to investigate its effect on the post-editor's work.~For this reason, a termbase focused on the institutional academic domain, e.g.~the UCL-K.U.Leuven University Terminology Database} or the Innsbrucker Termbank 2.0} could be used to select an adequate benchmark for the development and evaluation of an MT engine with a high degree of accuracy in the translation of terms.",10,Machine Translation

Although the process is not based on morpheme segmentation, the model shows sensitivity to stem selection and stem-ending boundaries.","Morphological induction can be defined as the task of singling out morphological formatives from fully inflected word forms. These formatives are understood to be part of the morphological lexicon, where they are accessed and retrieved, to be recombined and spelled out in word production. The view requires that a word form be segmented into meaningful morphemes, each contributing a separable piece of morpho-lexical content. Typically, this holds for regularly inflected forms, as with Italian cred-ut-o 'believed' (past participle, from \textsc{credere}), where cred- conveys the lexical meaning, and -ut-o is associated with morpho-syntactic features. A further assumption is that there always exists an underlying base form upon which all other forms are spelled out. In an irregular verb form like Italian appes-o 'hung' (from \textsc{appendere}), however, it soon becomes difficult to separate morpholexical information (the verb stem) from morpho-syntactic information. A different formulation of the same task assumes that the lexicon consists of fully-inflected word forms and that morphology induction is the result of finding out implicative relations between them. Unknown forms are generated by redundant analogy-based patterns between known forms, along the lines of an analogical proportion such as: rendere `make' :: reso `made' = appendere `hang' :: appeso `hung'. Support to this view comes from developmental psychology, where words are understood as the foundational elements of language acquisition, from which early grammar rules emerge epiphenomally AUTHOR. After all, children% are exposed to fully inflected forms in acquisition, and have no privileged access to underlying base forms. Besides, they {} appear to be extremely sensitive to subregularities holding between inflectionally-related forms AUTHOR. Further support is lent by neurobiologically inspired computer models of language, blurring the traditional dichotomy between processing and storage AUTHOR. In particular we will consider here the consequences of this view on issues of word inflection by recurrent Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks AUTHOR.","To meaningfully assess the relative computational difficulty of the cell-filling task, we calculated a simple baseline performance, with 695 forms of our original datasets selected for training, and 55 for testing. For this purpose, we used the baseline system for Task 1 of the CoNLL- SIGMORPHON-2017 Universal Morphological Reinflection shared task.5 The model changes the infinitive into its inflected forms through rewrite rules of increasing specificity: e.g. two Italian forms such as badare ‘to look after’ and bado ‘I look after’ stand in a BASE :: PRES _ IND _3 S relation. The most general rule changing the former into the latter is -are -> -o, but more specific rewrite rules can be extracted from the same pair: -dare -> -do, -adare -> -ado, -badare -> -bado. The algorithm then generates the PRES _ IND _3 S of - say - diradare ’thin out’, by using the rewrite rule with the longest left-hand side matching diradare (namely -adare > -ado). If there is no matching rule, the base is used as a default output. The algorithm proves to be effective for regu- lar forms in both languages (Table 2). However, per-word accuracy drops dramatically on German irregulars (0.23), and Italian irregulars (0.5). The same table shows accuracy scores on test data obtained by running 128, 256 and 512 LSTM blocks. Each model instance was run 10 times, and overall per-word scores are averaged across repetitions. The CoNLL baseline is reminiscent of AUTHOR Minimal Generalization Learner, inferring Italian infinitives from first singular present indicative forms AUTHOR. In the present case, however, the inference goes from the infinitive (base) to other paradigm cells. The inference is much weaker in German, where stem allomorphy is more consistently distributed within each paradigm. In Appendix, Table 3 contains a list of all German forms wrongly produced by the CoNLL baseline, together with per-word accuracy of our models. Most wrong forms are inflected forms requiring ablaut, which turn out to be over-regularised by the CoNLL baseline (e.g. *stehtet for standet, *beginntet for begannt). It appears that, in German, a purely syntagmatic approach to word production, deriving all inflected forms from an underlying base, has a strong bias towards over-regularisation. Simply put, the orthotactic/phonotactic structure of the German stem is less criterial for stem allomorphy than the Italian one. LSTMs are considerably more robust in this respect. Memory resources allowing, they can keep track of local syntagmatic constraints as well as more global, paradigmatic constraints, whereby all paradigmatically-related forms contribute to fill in gaps in the same paradigm. For example, knowledge that a paradigm contains a few stem allomorphs is good reason for an LSTM to produce a stem allomorph in other (empty) cells. The more systematic the distribution of stem alternants is across the paradigm, the easier for the learner to fill in empty cells. German conjugation proves to be paradigmatically well-behaved. An LSTM recurrent network has no information about the morphological structure of input forms. Due to the predictive nature of the production task and the LSTM re-entrant layer, however, the network develops a left-to-right sensitivity to upcoming symbols, with per-symbol accuracy being a function of the network confidence about the next output symbol. To assess the correlation between per-symbol accuracy and “perception” of the morphological structure, we used a Linear Mixed Effects (LME) model of how well structural features of German and Italian verb forms interpolate the “average” network accuracy in producing an upcoming symbol (1 for a hit, 0 for a miss) in both training and test. The marginal plots of Figure 2 show that there is a clear structural effect of the distance to the stem-ending boundary of the symbol currently being produced, over and above the length of the input string. Besides, stems and suffixes of regulars exhibit different accuracy slopes compared with stems and suffixes of irregulars. Intuitively, production of an inflected form by a LSTM network is fairly easy at the beginning of the stem, but it soon gets more difficult when approaching the morpheme boundary, particularly with irregulars. Accuracy reaches the minimum value on the first symbol of the inflectional ending, which marks a point of structural discontinuity in an inflected verb form. From that position, accuracy starts increasing again, showing a characteristically V-shaped trend. Clearly, this trend is more apparent with test words (Figure 2, bottom), where stems and endings are recombined in novel ways. The same results hold for German. On the other hand, no evidence of structure sensitivity was found in a LME model of the baseline output for both German and Italian. The cell-filling problem is an ecological, developmentally motivated task, based on evidence of fully inflected forms. Although other (simpler) models have been proposed to account for form- meaning mapping in Morphology (AUTHOR; AUTHOR, among oth- ers), we do not know of any other artificial neural networks that can simulate word inflection as a cell-filling task. Unlike more traditional connectionist architectures AUTHOR, recurrent LSTMs do not presuppose the existence of underlying base forms, but they learn possibly alternating stems upon exposure to full forms. Admittedly, the use of orthogonal one-hot vectors for lemmas, unigram temporal series for inflected forms, and abstract morphosyntactic features as a proxy of context-sensitive functional agreement effects, are crude representational short-hands. Nonetheless, in tackling the task, LSTMs prove to be able to orchestrate “deep” knowledge about word structure, well beyond pure surface word relations: namely stem- affix boundaries, paradigm organisation and degrees of regularity in stem formation. Acquisition of different inflectional systems may require a different balance of all these pieces of knowledge.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In this paper we follow the approach proposed in AUTHOR and we use public textual descriptions of urban areas to design a novel machine learning representation. We represent urban areas as: (i) a bag-of-concepts (BOC), e.g., the terms Arts and Entertainment, College and University, Event, Food extracted from the Foursquare description of the area; and (ii) the same concepts above organized in a tree, which reflects the hierarchical organization of Foursquare activities.

For the development of IFrameNet linguistic analysis, corpusprocessing and machine learning techniques are combined in order to support the semiautomatic development and annotation of the resource.","Firstly developed at the University of Berkeley (California) in 1997, FrameNet adopts theories from Frame Semantics AUTHOR to NLP and explains words’ meanings according to the semantic frames they evoke. It illustrates semantic frames (i.e. schematizations of prototypical events, relations or entities in the reality), through the involved participants (called frame elements, FEs) and the evoking words (or, better, the lexical units, LUs). Moreover, FrameNet aims to give a valence representation of the lexical units and underline the relations between frames and between frame elements AUTHOR. The initial American project has since been extended to other languages: French, Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese, German, Spanish, Japanese, Swedish and Korean. All these projects are based on the idea that most of the Frames are the same among languages and that, thanks to this, it is possible to adopt Berkeley’s Frames and FEs and their relations, with few changes, once all the language-specific information has been cut away (AUTHOR, AUTHOR). With regard to Italian, over the past ten years several research projects have been carried out at different universities and Research Centres. In particular, the ILC-CNR in Pisa (e.g. AUTHOR; AUTHOR), FBK in Trento (e.g. AUTHOR, AUTHOR) and the University of Rome, Tor Vergata (e.g. AUTHOR, AUTHOR) proposed automatic or semiautomatic methods to develop an Italian FrameNet. However, as of today, a resource even remotely equivalent to Berkeley’s FrameNet (BFN) is still missing. As a lexical resource of this kind is useful in many computational applications (such as HumanRobot interaction), a new effort is currently being jointly made at the universities of Bologna and Roma, Tor Vergata. The IFrameNet project aims to develop a large-coverage FrameNet-like resource for Italian, relying on robust and scalable methods, in which the automatic corpus processing is consistently integrated with manual lexical analysis. It builds upon the achievements of previous projects that automatically harvested FrameNet LUs exploiting both distributional and WordNet based models (AUTHOR). Since the LUs induction is a noisy process, the data thus obtained need to be manually refined and validated. The aim is also to provide Sample Sentences for LUs with the highest corpus frequency. On the one side, they will be derived from already existing resources such as the HuRIC corpus AUTHOR or the EvalIta2011 FLaIT task data: FBK set AUTHOR and ILC set AUTHOR. On the other side, candidate sentences will also be extracted through semi-automatic distributional analysis of a large corpus i.e. CORIS AUTHOR and refined through linguistic analysis and manual validation of data thus obtained.","In order to evaluate the proposed supervised classification method for the stage “First Lexical Analysis and Validation” we run and experimental evaluation over a set of 3261 frames, the ones with more than 5 lexical units in the initial lexicon. In this way, we selected 1,095 different LUs, represented as an embedding vector in the wordspace. On average, we have 12 LU per frame, and every individual lexical entry l appears in about 1.88 frames. The baseline of a classification task that maps a sentence s including a lexical unit into its own frame is about 35%, as for the ambiguity characterizing most frequent entries. We asked three annotators to evaluate individual triples ⟨l, s, f⟩ validating the system proposal. Four main cases where possible: • MISSING FRAME. The sentence s is not manifesting any of the frames f evoked by the lexical unit l, but corresponds to a frame not yet present in the lexicon for l. In this case the algorithm cannot provide the suitable frame, as it cannot generate a novel frame. • NOT APPLICABLE. The sentence s does not contain an occurrence of the lexical unit l in one of its proper senses: this case is typical for phraseological uses of a verb such as morire di freddo, andare di fretta, … that do not directly correspond to lexical predicates and thus cannot be treated through the lexical embedding vectors. • CORRECT/INCORRECT, when the outcome argmaxf’ { h(l,s,f’) } is correct (or incorrect) as the frame evoked by l in s is exactly (or not) f. According to the above method annotators validated 667 sentences for 113 frames and 212 different verbal lexical units. The analysis resulted into a precision (i.e. the number of correct candidate frames emitted by the algorithm w.r.t. the number of valid cases, that is all but the MISSING FRAME or NOT APPLICABLE cases) is 75,2%, well beyond the 35% baseline. The method could be applied onto the 74,5% of the sentences, including CORRECT cases and MISSING FRAME cases. We neglected in this coverage score the NOT APPLICABLE cases that amount to 44 sentences, i.e. about 6,4%. Examples of the correct assignment of the algorithm on quite ambiguous verbs, such as finire (i.e. to end, in frames ACTIVITY_FINISH, CAUSE_TO_END and KILLING) or rivelare (i.e. to reveal, in frames REVEAL_SECRET, OMEN, EVIDENCE) are the following: La vicenda avrebbe potuto [finire]ACTIVITY_FINISH lì , ma il prefetto di Nuoro fece presentare ... In prova si è [rivelato]EVIDENCE ad altissimo livello sia sull' asciutto sia sul … An example of Missing Frame is BEAT_OPPONENT for the verb battere in ... impegnato a fornire quante più informazioni possibili, anche per [battere]BEAT_OPPONENT la concorrenza dei siti Ipsoa e il ... as the lexicon of the verb battere only includes the frames CAUSE_HARM, CORPORAL_PUNISHMENT and EXPERIENCE_BODI-LY_HARM. The experiments only run over verbal lexical units will be extended soon to nouns and adjectives. However, the encouraging precision reached by the method allows for direct use it in an iterative active learning schema, where the more ambiguous sentences found and annotated within a specific training stage are used to train the system at the next stage. We expect this to speed up the lexicon development process and to allow bootstrapping with fewer resources. The lexicon will be made available for crowdsourcing further annotations and delivered incrementally in the next few months.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Different from academic work, which is oriented towards complex networks for achieving a marginal improvement, real scenarios require flexible and efficient neural models. The possibility to use the same models on different domains and languages plays an important role in the selection of the most appropriate architecture. We found that a small modification of the state-of-the-art network according to academic benchmarks led to a flexible neural model that also preserves high accuracy.","In recent years, Sentiment Analysis (SA) in Twitter has been widely studied. Its popularity has been fed by the remarkable interest of the industrial world on this topic as well as the relatively easy access to data, which, among other, allowed the academic world to promote evaluation campaigns, e.g., AUTHOR, for different languages. Many models have been developed and tested on these benchmarks, e.g., AUTHOR. They all appear very appealing from an industrial perspective, as SA is strongly connected to many types of business through specific KPIs. However, previous academic work has not provided clear indications on how to select the most appropriate learning architecture for industrial applications. In this paper, we report on our experience on adopting academic models of SA to a commercial application. This is a social media and micro-blogging monitoring platform to analyze brand reputation, competition, the voice of the customer and customer experience. More in detail, sentiment analysis algorithms register customers' opinions and feedbacks on services and products, both direct and indirect. An important aspect is that such clients push for easily adaptable and reliable solutions. Indeed, multi-tenant applications and sentiment analysis requirements cause a high variability of the approaches to the tasks within the same platform. This should be capable of managing multi-domain and multi-channel content in different languages as it provides services for several clients in different market segments. Moreover, scalability and lightweight use of computational resources preserving accuracy is also an important aspect. Finally, dealing with different client domains and data potentially requires constantly training new models with limited time availability. To meet the above requirements we started from the state-of-the-art model proposed in AUTHOR, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with few layers mainly devoted to encoding a sentence representation. We modified it by adopting a recurrent pooling layer, which allows the network to learn longer dependencies in the input sentence. An additional benefit is that such simple architecture makes the network more robust to biases from the dataset, generalizing better on the less represented classes. Our experiments on the SemEval data in English as well as on a commercial dataset in Italian show a constant improvement of our networks over the state of the art. In the following, Section sec:rel-work places the current work in the literature. Section sec:scenario introduces the application scenario. Sections sec:arch and sec:experiments presents respectively our proposal for a flexible architecture and the experimental results. Finally, Section sec:conclusion reports the conclusions.","In this paper, we have studied state-of-the-art neural networks for the Sentiment Analysis of Twitter text associated with a real application scenario.

In the present study, we investigated to what extent compounding involves general-level cognitive abilities related to conceptual combination. If that was the case, the compounding mechanism should be largely invariant across different languages. Under this assumption, a compositional model trained on word representations in one language should be able to predict compound meanings in other languages. We investigated this hypothesis by training a word embeddingbased compositional model on a set of plied this model to German and Italian test compounds. The model partially predicted compound meanings in German, but not in Italian.","Compounds are complex words such as airport, with two constituents that can be used as free words. Compounding is a highly prevalent phenomenon across many languages. It has been argued to be a proto-linguistic structure to combine simple words into novel and complex concepts, from which more complex compositional language structures have been derived (Jackendoff, 2002). Given the prevalence and ubiquity of compounding across languages, it is reasonable to assume that speakers of different languages rely, to some degree, on the same cognitive mechanisms to compose the meanings of constituents into a compound meaning. Indeed, the linguistic phenomenon of compounding is generally considered to be the linguistic mirror of the cognitive process of conceptual combination (Gagn´e and Spalding, 2009; Murphy, 2002). Thus, while speciﬁc aspects of compounding will inevitably vary between languages due to differences in the language structure and other idiosyncracies, we assume that there is also a language-invariant aspect of compounding that can be transferred across languages. We will investigate this hypothesis by examining whether a compositional model trained on one language (English) is able to predict compound meanings in other languages (German and Italian).","Our results show that a compositional model trained in one language exclusively (English) can be applied to another language (German) to partially predict the meanings of compounds in the latter, of which the model had no training experience at all. Obviously, the model trained on English compounds predicted English compound meanings far better than German compound meanings. This does not stand contrary to our hypothesis: We do not assume that compounding is a tout-court language-invariant mechanism, but that compounding also encompasses general mechanisms besides language-speciﬁc features. However, the model trained on English was not able to predict Italian compound meanings above baseline level. Thus, our results only partially support our hypothesis. In interpreting this ﬁnding, it has to be considered that the Italian evaluation set was far smaller than the English and the German sets, leading to decreased statistical power in this case (note that, on a purely descriptive level, model performance in Italian is slightly above baseline). Keeping that in mind, our results indicate that the applicability of a compositional model across languages seems to depend on the similarity between the language in which a model was trained and the one where it is applied. 1The head is the compound constituent that denotes the semantic category of a word: an airport is a type of port. In structural terms, German is in fact much more similar to English than Italian. Both English and German are West-Germanic languages which almost exclusively produce head-second compounds and have highly productive and very rich compounding systems. Italian compounds however can be head-ﬁrst or head-second, and the compounding system is far less productive in Italian than in English or German (one of the factors responsible for the fact that our Italian item set was smaller than the English or German sets). This explanation is still tentative given the restricted range of languages investigated here. A more thorough investigation on this speciﬁc issue would require tests on a wide range of languages, which should be theoretically characterized in terms of their structural similarity with respect to compounding beforehand. Additionally, future work is required to address other language-dependent aspects of compounding. For example, we focussed only on closedform compounds, while some languages (for example English and Italian, but not German) can produce open forms such as school bus or pesce spada. Another issue to be investigated more closely is headedness. On the one hand, headsecond Italian compounds are more similar to English and German from a structural point of view; on the other hand, head-ﬁrst compounds are assumed to be more like English and German in terms of productivity and regularity of meaning. Although our item set included head-ﬁrst as well as head-second Italian compounds, both are obviously still smaller than the complete Italian item set. Thus, in future studies larger item sets are required to provide such differential tests with the necessary statistical power.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We present a text classiﬁer that can distinguish Italian news stories from editorials. Inspired by earlier work on pus and implemented a range of features, which can predict the distinction with an accuracy of 89,12%. As demonstrated by the earlier work, such a feature-based approach outperforms simple bag-of-words models when being transferred to new domains. We argue that the technique can also be used to distinguish opinionated from non-opinionated text outside of the realm of newspapers.","The computational task of text classiﬁcation is typically targeting the question of domain: Is a text about sports, the economy, local politics, etc. But texts can also be grouped by their genre: Is it a business letter, a personal homepage, a cooking recipe, and so on. In this paper, we perform genre classiﬁcation on newspaper text and are speciﬁcally interested in the question whether a text communicates a news report or gives an opinion, i.e., it is an editorial (or some similar opinionated piece). This task is relevant for many information extraction applications based on newspaper text, and it can also be extended from newspapers to other kinds of text, where the distinction ”opinionated or not” is of interest, as in sentiment analysis or argumentation mining. Our starting point is the work by (Kr¨uger et al., 2017), who presented a news/editorial classiﬁer for English. They demonstrated that using linguistically-motivated features leads to better results than bag-of-words or POS-based models, when it comes to changing the domain of text (which newspaper, which time of origin, which type of content). To transfer the approach to Italian, we assembled a suitable corpus for training and testing, selected preprocessing tools, and adapted the features used by the classiﬁer from Kr¨uger et al. Our results are in same range of the original work, indicating that the problem can be solved for Italian in pretty much the same way. We found some differences in the relative feature strengths, however. After considering related work in Section 2, we describe our corpus (Section 3) and the classiﬁcation experiments (Section 4), and then conclude.","We presented, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst classiﬁer that is able to distinguish ‘news’ from ‘editorials’ in an Italian newspaper corpus. It follows a linguistic feature-oriented approach proposed by (Kr¨uger et al., 2017) for English, who had demonstrated that it outperforms lexical and POS-based models. In our implementation, With an accuracy of 89.09% the distinction between the two subgenres can be drawn quite reliably. Our results are comparable to that of Kr¨uger et al., which indicates (again, to our knowledge for the ﬁrst time) that their feature space is applicable successfully to languages other than English. Our central concern for this kind of task is robustness against domain changes of different kinds. To this end, Kr¨uger et al. had worked with different newspaper sources and demonstrated the utility of the feature approach in such settings. While we were not able to assemble large corpora from different papers, we ran other experiments in the same vein, where the ﬁrst shows that the system is robust against changing the portions of the newspapers (i.e., economy versus local affairs, and so on). In the second one, we applied the classiﬁer, as trained on the newspaper data, to the distinction between Italian Wikipedia articles and Amazon reviews, where the results remained stable as well. We take this as an indication that the classiﬁer captures a general difference between ‘opinionated’ and ‘non-opinionated’ text, and not just some ‘ad hoc’ phenomena of certain newspaper sub-genres.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

Results show that, on the basis of contexts of use, a negated adjective (e.g., not cold) is typically more similar to the adjective itself (cold) than to its antonym (hot); such effect is less strong for antonyms derived by afﬁxation (e.g., happy - unhappy).","Negation has long represented a challenge for theoretical and computational linguists (see Horn (1989) and Morante and Sporleder (2012) for overviews): in spite of the relative simplicity of logical negation (¬p is true ↔p is false), complexity arises when negation interacts with morphosyntax, semantics and pragmatics. In this work, we focus on the negation of adjectives in English, expressed by the particle not modifying an adjective, as in not cold. A na¨ıve ∗Part of the work presented in this paper was carried out while the ﬁrst author was at the University of Amsterdam. account of these expressions would be to equate them to antonyms, and hence take them to convey the opposite of the adjective (e.g., not cold = hot). In fact, this simplifying assumption is sometimes made in computational approaches which model negation as a mapping from an adjective to its antonym (e.g., The Pham et al., (2015), Rimell et al., (2017)). However, a range of studies support what is known as mitigation hypothesis (Jespersen, 1965; Horn, 1972; Giora, 2006), according to which a negated adjective conveys an intermediate meaning between the adjective and its antonym (e.g., not large ≈medium-sized). The meaning of the adjective is mitigated by negation, while some emphasis on it still persists in memory (Giora et al., 2005). This view is compatible with pragmatic theories predicting that the use of a more complex expression (not large) when a simpler one is available (small) triggers the implicature that a different meaning is intended (e.g., medium-sized) (Grice, 1975; Horn, 1984). Computational models predicting similar mitigating effects are those by Hermann et al., (2013) and Socher et al., (2012; 2013). In this work, we investigate negated adjectives from the perspective of Distributional Semantics (Lenci, 2008; Turney and Pantel, 2010). We study antonymic adjectives and their negations in terms of their distribution across contexts of use: to this end, we employ an existing dataset of antonyms, whose annotation we further extend, and the distributional representations of these and their negated version, as derived with a standard distributional model. This allows us to conduct a data-driven study of negation and antonymy that covers a large set of instances. We compare pairs of antonyms with distinct lexical roots and those derived by afﬁxation, i.e., lexical and morphological antonyms (Joshi, 2012) (e.g., small large and happy - unhappy respectively). More over, we investigate the distinction between lexical antonyms that are contrary or contradictory, that is, those that have or do not have an available intermediate value (Fraenkel and Schul, 2008): e.g., something not cold is not necessarily hot - it could be lukewarm - but something not present is absent. As for negations of morphological antonyms, we compare instances of simple and double negation, where the latter occurs if the antonym that is negated is an afﬁxal negation (e.g., not unhappy). Our analyses show that, when considering distributional information, negated adjectives are more similar to the adjective itself than to the antonym (e.g., not cold is closer to cold than to hot), regardless of the type of antonym or of negation. However, we ﬁnd that morphological antonymy is closer to negation than lexical one is.","We have investigated negated adjectives using the tools of Distributional Semantics, which allows us to quantify the similarities between expressions on the basis of how they are used. Our analyses show that, when considering contexts of occurrence, negating an adjective does not make it closer to the antonym than to the adjective itself. This can be seen as a result of the various functions of negation (e.g., mitigation, contradiction to an expectation, politeness) that may lead to different patterns of use for negated adjectives and antonyms. Further research may shed light on which type of contexts actually discriminate them, for example through a corpus study, and which other properties negated adjectives have in a distributional space, such as their interaction with scalar dimensions (e.g., not hot vs. freezing, cold, lukewarm, hot etc.; Wilkinson and Tim (2016)). Finally, while for the purpose of this study we opted for a standard word2vec model, one could test for the same effects with differently obtained distributional vectors. Despite its current limitations in covering truthrelated aspects of meaning, Distributional Semantics was shown by Kruszewski et al. (2017) to be apt to model at least some aspects of negation, especially if graded in nature, such as alternativehood. Our study provides supporting evidence for this line of research and in addition points at the utility of using Distributional Semantics to uncover nuanced differences in use between a negation and other expressions, even when logically equivalent. Moreover, we regard our results to be of general interest for the NLP community, since effects of negation like the ones we studied and how they are represented in a distributional space can be critical for tasks like sentiment analysis (e.g., what does it imply that a costumer is not happy or not unhappy with a product?; Wiegand et al, (2010)).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis
244_2018,2018,paper04,"Fabio Celli, Bruno Lepri",Is Big Five better than MBTI? A personality computing challenge using Twitter data,ENG,2,0,0,Fondazione Bruno Kessler,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Trento,"Personality Computing from text has become popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP). For assessing gold-standard personality types, Big5 and MBTI are two popular models but still there is no comparison of the two in personality computing. With this paper, we provide for the ﬁrst time a comparison of the two models from a computational perspective. To do that we exploit two multilingual datasets collected from Twitter in English, Italian, Spanish and Dutch.","The last decade has been characterized by the rise of personality computing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Vinciarelli and Mohammadi, 2014): for example, several works have dealt with the automatic prediction of personality traits of authors from different pieces of text they wrote in emails, blogs or social media (Mairesse et al., 2007; Iacobelli et al., 2011; Schwartz et al., 2013) (Rangel Pardo et al., 2015). Personality computing is also broadening its application to many ﬁelds in academia as well as in industry, including security (Golbeck et al., 2011), human resources (Turban et al., 2017), advertising (Celli et al., 2017) and deception detection (Fornaciari et al., 2013). Historically, there are two popular but very different psychological tests to asses personality: (i) the Big Five (Costa and McCrae, 1985; Costa and McCrae, 2008), which is widely accepted in academia, and (ii) the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) (Myers and Myers, 2010), which is very popular and widely used in industry. The Big Five model deﬁnes personality along 5 bipolar scales: Extraversion (sociable vs. shy); Emotional Stability (secure vs. neurotic); Agreeableness (friendly vs. ugly); Conscientiousness (organized vs. careless); Openness to Experience (insightful vs. unimaginative). In contrast, the MBTI deﬁnes 4 binary classes that combines into 16 personality types: Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Perception/Judging, Feeling/Thinking. Correlation analyses of the personality measures showed that Big Five Extraversion was correlated with MBTI Extraversion-Introversion, Openness to Experience was correlated with Sensing-Intuition, Agreeableness with Thinking-Feeling and Conscientiousness with Judging-Perceiving (Furnham et al., 2003). A reason for the recently gained popularity of MBTI is the fact that it is easier to collect gold-standard labelled data about MBTI than about Big Five, as an MBTI type is a 4-letter coding (e.g., INTJ) that could be retrieved with simple queries. In a ﬁeld like personality computing, where data is costly and difﬁcult to collect, this is an enormous advantage. In this paper we address the question whether it is easier to predict Big Five or MBTI classes with a machine learning approach. To do so, we collect two Twitter datasets in English, Italian, Dutch and Spanish, one annotated with the Big Five personality types and one with MBTI. We believe that this work will be useful for the scientiﬁc community of personality computing to better understand the heuristic power of the two models when applied to machine learning tasks. The paper is structured as follows: in the next section we provide an overview of related works in the ﬁeld of personality computing in NLP, in Section 3 we describe the datasets we used, in Section 4 we report the results of our experiments and in Section 5 we draw some conclusions.","Conclusion Conclusion In this paper we provide for the ﬁrst time a comparison of Big Five and MBTI from a personality computing perspective. To do so we use two multilingual Twitter datasets, one annotated with Big Five classes and one with MBTI classes. For the ﬁrst time, we provide an evidence that algorithms trained on MBTI could have better performances than trained on the Big Five, although the Big Five is much more informative and has great variability in performance depending also on the algorithm used for the prediction. We let available the ﬁles used for the experiments2, in order to grant the replicability or improvement of the results. 2http://personality.altervista.org/fabio.htm",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

Non-local dependencies connecting distant structural chunks are often modeled using (LIFO) memory buffers (see Chesi 2012 for a review). Other solutions (e.g. slash features in HPSG, Pollard & Sag 1994) are not directly usable both in parsing and in generation algorithms without undermining an incremental leftright processing assumption. Memory buffers are however empirically limited and psycholinguistically invalid (Nairne 2002). Here I propose to adopt Trie memories instead of stacks. This leads to simpler and more transparent solutions for establishing non-local dependencies both for whargumental configurations and for anaphoric pronominal coreference.","Relations among structural chunks in a sentence are not always resolvable using strictly local dependencies. This is the case of argumental wh items in languages like English (or Italian), where the argument and the predicate can be arbitrarily distant, (1).a. Another case of non-local dependency is pronominal coreference that in some cases can also be cross-sentential, (1).b-b', (1).b-b''. (1) a. [X Cosa] (tu) pensi che (io) [Y mangi_]? what (you) think that (I) eatSUBJ-1P-Sing what do you think I eat? b. [X Gianni]i saluta [Z Mario]j. G. says hello (to) M. b'. Poi pro i [Y si]i lava. then (he) himselfj washes. then he washes himself b''. Poi pro i [Y lo]j lava. then (he) himj washes. then he washes him From a purely structural perspective, the chunks X and Y enter a non-local dependency relation when some material Z intervenes between them. A long tradition of different approaches addressed this issue from different perspective (see Nivre 2008, for instance, for a comparison among Stack-based and List-based algorithms in parsing). Most of the time these approaches rely on transformations of the grammar into a deductive system for both parsing (Shieber et al. 1995) and generation (Shieber 1988). A loss of transparency with respect to the linguistic intuitions that motivated a specific grammatical formalism is then at issue. Here I will argue in favor of a simple derivational and deterministic perspective in which phrases are considered the result of the recursive application of structure building operations (Chomsky 1995). In its simplest format, classic structural descriptions, (2).a, reduce to lexicalized trees, (2).a', in which x and z creates a constituent (get merged) either if x selects z (=z x, in Stabler’s 1997 formalism) or the way around (=x z). Leaves are linearly ordered and constituents labels reduce to the selecting lexical items. (2) a. a'. By definition, x and y cannot enter a local dependency whenever an intervening item z blocks a local selection between x and y. There are cases, however, in which x and y should enter a local selection relation: in (1).a, x receives a thematic role from y, hence y should select x according to the uniformity of theta-role assignment hypothesis (Baker 1988). In this case, a non-local dependency must be established. Implementing the movement metaphor (Stabler 1997) in top-down terms, Chesi (2017) proposes that an item x is moved into a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) memory buffer (M) whenever it brings into the computation features that are unselected: if a (categorial) feature X is selected and a lexical item a brings X but also Y from the lexicon (i.e. [X Y a]]), then a gets merged (i.e. [X[X Y a]]), but the unselected feature [Y (a)] is moved into the last position (the most prominent one) of the M-buffer. As soon as a feature Y will be selected (=Y), the last item in the memory buffer, if bearing the relevant Y category, will be remerged in the structure before any other item from the lexicon, the satisfying a local selection requirement. After its re-merge, the item is removed from the M-buffer. This paper proposes a theoretical solution for simplifying this memory-based approach without losing any descriptive adequacy: here I will do away with the buffer idea (and, as a consequence, with the LIFO restrictions) by postulating a memory Trie (Fredkin 1960) based on the features merged in the structure during the derivation. I will show that this solution is psycholinguistically more plausible than LIFO buffers used so far and computationally sound.","In this paper, I presented a revision of the memory buffer used for parsing and generation in PMGs: instead of using a classic LIFO memory, proved to be sufficient to capture locality effects (Friedmann et al. 2009) when “similar” NPs are processed (Warren & Gibson 2005, Chesi 2017), but not fully plausible from a psycholinguistic perspective (no serial order seems to be relevant at retrieval, Nairne 2002, as we saw also in case of pronominal binding), I defined a Trie memory replacement, based on feature hierarchies sensitive to the structural insertion point of the memorized item. This prevents order of insertion from being strictly relevant at retrieval, without losing any ability to discriminate the correct items to be recalled for establishing a relevant (non-local) structural dependency both in thematic role assignment or anaphoric binding contexts. The Trie structure here proposed is clearly a bit simplistic, though based on a relevant evidence suggesting that person features are “higher” in the structure than “number” features (Mancini et al. 2011). Other (semantic) features should be included (e.g. animacy) as well as prosodic/salience markers (Topic, New Information/Contrastive Focus, Kiss 1998) that clearly play a role in making salient (i.e. unique in a Trie) a specific item, possibly relating the “fluctuation” of prominence of items stored in memory (Lewis & Vasishth 2005) to precise structural proprieties.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks
246_2018,2018,paper08,"Maria De Martino, Azzurra Mancuso, Alessandro Laudanna",Grammatical Class Effects in Production of Italian Inflected Verbs,ENG,3,2,1,Università di Salerno,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Salerno,"We report a picture-word interference (PWI) experiment conducted in Italian where target verbs were used to name pictures in presence of semantically related and unrelated distracters. The congruency of grammatical class between targets and distracters was manipulated and nouns and verbs were used as distracters. Consistently with previous studies, an expected semantic interference effect was observed but, interestingly, such an effect does not equally apply to target-distracter pairs sharing or not grammatical class information. This outcome seems to corroborate the hypothesis of the intervention of grammatical constraints in word production as explored in the PWI task.","Models of lexical access share the assumption that different kinds of linguistic information (semantic, orthographic-phonological, syntacticgrammatical, and so on) have different levels of lexical representation (Caramazza, 1997; Levelt, Roelofs and Meyer, 1999; Dell, 1986). The picture-word interference (PWI) paradigm has been widely exploited to test the dynamics of activation of different properties of words during lexical production. Such a task allows the observation of specific lexical effects by manipulating the linguistic relation between words to be used in a picture naming task and written distracterwords super-imposed to pictures. The basic assumption is that linguistic information of a distractor inﬂuences the time needed to select the appropriate word-form to name a picture. For instance, two well-known effects observed in PWI, the semantic interference and the phonological facilitation effects, are thought to reflect respectively the competition at the lexical level between the lexical representations of the target and the distracter and the co-activation of the phonemes shared by the target and the distracter during the phonetic encoding stage. Scholars have also tried to investigate the activation of grammatical information in speech production through the PWI paradigm but conflicting evidence has been collected. For instance, Pechmann and Zerbst (2002), Pechmann and coll. (2004), Vigliocco and coll. (2005), Rodriguez-Ferreiro and coll. (2014), De Simone and Collina (2016) obtained grammatical class effects, while Mahon and coll. (2007), Iwasaki and coll. (2008) and Janssen and coll. (2010) did not. Arguably, the variability in the experimental evidence can be ascribed to heterogeneous methodologies across studies: for instance, results obtained by Vigliocco and coll. (2005) could be biased by their methodological choice to administer noun-distracters with determiners, while in the study of Rodriguez-Ferreiro and coll. (2014) semantic categories (actions/objects/instruments) partially overlapped grammatical classes and a confound due to an imageability bias (Exp. 3) was present. As a consequence, the intervention of grammatical constraints during production processes, as explored in PWI tasks, is still debated. In this study on Italian we aimed at exploring the problem by trying to avoid possible confounds existing in previous studies.","One of the aim of the present experiment was to overcome some limitations of previous investigations. The following constraints were adopted: 1. We contrasted the production of verbs when presented with semantically related and unrelated distracters: the expected semantic interference effect guaranteed for the reliability of the paradigm. 2. We selected experimental materials where the differences between grammatical classes in terms of their semantic domain (objects (nouns) vs. actions (verbs)) was kept under control. 3. Word-class ambiguous items were excluded by experimental materials. 4. Inflected finite verbal-forms were used both as targets and distracters: these verbal forms allow to maximize the difference between nouns and verbs2. Actually, the Italian inflected form “amavo” (indicative, imperfect, 1st singular person, I used to love), is composed of a stem, “am-”, which conveys the core meaning of the verb, the vowel “-a-”, which specifies the inflectional pattern compatible with the verbal stem, the segment “–v-”, which encodes mood and tense information, and the segment ”-o” which encodes person and number information. None of these features, with the exception of meaning and number features, can be part of the lexical representation of noun-forms. This latter manipulation has relevant consequences on the detection of grammatical class effect in PWI, since it has been demonstrated that, when finite verbs have to be produced, the naming context sets the response-relevant criterion on the grammatical class of verbs and then noundistracters tend to interfere significantly more than verb-distracters (De Martino & Laudanna, 2017)3. Consistently with previous PWI evidence, our experiment replicated a reliable semantic interference effect. This finding confirms that the selection of an oral target response is slowed-down by the activation of a semantically-related distracter because the lexical system has to manage the level of activation of target lexical competitors, including the highly activated semantically related distracter word. Interestingly, we observed that, at least when pictures have to be named by using inflected verb forms, such an effect does not equally affect all semantically related target-distracter pairs: related pairs sharing grammatical class information do not exhibit significant semantic interference but grammatical-class incongruent pairs do. In conclusion, our data suggest that the PWI task is sensitive to the manipulation of grammatical class information. In other words, such a pattern of results is compatible with the intervention of grammatical constraints during production processes, as explored in the PWI task.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis
247_2018,2018,paper09,"Samuel Louvan, Bernardo Magnini",From General to Specific: Leveraging Named Entity Recognition for Slot Filling in Conversational Language Understanding,ENG,3,0,0,"Università di Trento, Fondazione Bruno Kessler",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Trento,"Slot ﬁlling techniques are often English. Slot ﬁlling techniques are often adopted in language understanding components for task-oriented dialogue systems. In recent approaches, neural models for slot ﬁlling are trained on domainspeciﬁc datasets, making it difﬁcult porting to similar domains when few or no training data are available. In this paper we use multi-task learning to leverage general knowledge of a task, namely Named Entity Recognition (NER), to improve slot ﬁlling performance on a semantically similar domain-speciﬁc task. Our experiments show that, for some datasets, transfer learning from NER can achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art and can also help slot ﬁlling in low resource scenarios.","In dialogue systems, semantic information of an utterance is generally represented with a semantic frame, a data structure consisting of a domain, an intent, and a number of slots (Tur, 2011). For example, given the utterance “I’d like a United Airlines ﬂight on Wednesday from San Francisco to Boston”, the domain would be ﬂight, the intent is booking, and the slot ﬁllers are United Airlines (for the slot airline name), Wednesday (booking time), San Francisco (origin), and Boston (destination). Automatically extracting this information involves domain identiﬁcation, intent classiﬁcation, and slot ﬁlling, which is the focus of our work. Slots are usually domain speciﬁc as they are predeﬁned for each domain. For instance, in the ﬂight domain the slots might be airline name, booking time, and airport name, while in the bus domain the slots might be pickup time, bus name, and travel duration. Recent successful approaches related to slot ﬁlling tasks (Wang et al., 2018; Liu and Lane, 2017a; Goo et al., 2018) are based on variants of recurrent neural network architecture. In general there are two ways of approaching the task: (i) by training a single model for each domain; or (ii) by performing domain adaptation, which results in a model that learns better feature representations across domains. All these approaches directly train the models on domain-speciﬁc slot ﬁlling datasets. In our work, instead of using a domain-speciﬁc slot ﬁlling dataset, which can be expensive to obtain being task speciﬁc, we propose to leverage knowledge gained from a more “general”, but semantically related, task, referred as the auxiliary task, and then transfer the learned knowledge to the more speciﬁc task, namely slot ﬁlling, referred as the target task, through transfer learning. In the literature, the term transfer learning can be used in different ways. We follow the deﬁnition from (Mou et al., 2016), in which transfer learning is viewed as a paradigm which enables a model to use knowledge from auxiliary tasks to help the target task. There are several ways to train this model: we can directly use the trained parameters of the auxiliary tasks to initialize the parameters in the target task (pre-train & ﬁne-tuning), or train a model of auxiliary and target tasks simultaneously, where some parameters are shared (multitask learning). We propose to train a slot ﬁlling model jointly with Named Entity Recognition (NER) as an auxiliary task through multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997). Recent studies have shown the potential of multi-task learning in NLP models. For example, (Mou et al., 2016) empirically evaluates transfer learning in sentence and question classiﬁcation tasks. (Yang et al., 2017) proposes an approach for transfer learning in sequence tagging tasks. NER is chosen as the auxiliary task for several reasons. First, named entities frequently occur as slot values in several domains, which make them a relevant general knowledge to exploit. The same NER type can refer to different slots in the same utterance. On the previous utterance example, the NER labels are LOC for both San Francisco and Boston, and ORG for United Airlines. Second, state-of-the-art performance of NER (Lample et al., 2016; Ma and Hovy, 2016) is relatively high, therefore we expect that the transferred feature representation can be useful for slot ﬁlling tasks. Third, large annotated NER corpora are easier to obtain compared to domain-speciﬁc slot ﬁlling datasets. The contributions of this work are as follows: we investigate the effectiveness of leveraging Named Entity Recognition as an auxiliary task to learn general knowledge, and transfer this knowledge to slot ﬁlling as the target task in a multi-task learning setting. To our knowledge, there is no reported work that uses NER transfer learning for slot ﬁlling in conversational language understanding. Our experiments show that for some datasets multi-task learning achieves better overall performance compared to previous published results, and performs better in some low resource scenarios.","In this work we train a slot ﬁlling domain-speciﬁc model adding NER information, under the assumption that NER introduces useful “general” labels, and that it is cheaper to obtain compared to task speciﬁc slot ﬁlling datasets. We use multitask learning to leverage the learned knowledge from NER to slot ﬁlling task. Our experiments show evidence that we can achieve comparable or better performance against the state-of-the-art approaches and against single task learning, both in full training data and low resource scenarios. In the future, we are interested in working on datasets in Italian and explore more sophisticated multitask learning strategies.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

We evaluate the performances of geoparsing and NER and test an approach to improve the accuracy of the latter.,"The iDAI.publications and the iDAI.world The Deutsches Arch¨aologisches Institute (German Archaeological Institute, henceforth DAI) is a German agency operating within the sphere of responsibility of the federal Foreign Ofﬁce; the goal of the institue is to promote research in archaeological sciences and on ancient civilizations worldwide. Founded in Rome in 1829, the DAI has developed into a complex institution, with branches and ofﬁces located around the world. The Institute has participated in several projects, including missions of paramount importance like those in Olympia, Pergamon or Elephantine. One of the most visible output of this activity is the amount of scientiﬁc publications produced by the DAI. The Institute currently publishes 14 international journals and 70 book series on different topics.1 Since 2018, part of this collection is now accessible to the public on a new online portal named idai.publications for books and journals.2 This ongoing initiative will not only enable researchers to have easier access to the published works; even more importantly, it will allow the Institute to integrate the data contained in articles and books (such as persons, places and archaeological sites, artifacts and monuments) into a network of all the other digital resources of the DAI. All the digital collections of the DAI are indeed designed to operate within a network known as the idai.welt (or idai.world).3 This network includes web collections such as “Arachne”, some of the most comprehensive bibliographies in the areas of activity of the different branches. The other cornerstone of the idai.world is represented by the layer of web-based services such as thesauri and controlled vocabularies. The idai.gazetteer,6 in particular, connects names of locations with unique identiﬁers and coordinates; the gazetteer is intended to serve both as a controlled list of topnyms for DAI’s services and to link the geographic data with other gazetteers. Unique identiﬁers deﬁned in the idai.gazetteer are already used to connect places and entries in Zenon and Arachne. In this way, users of these services can already query monuments and artifacts in Arachne or books in Zenon that are linked to a speciﬁc place.","The use of in-domain CRF models trained specifically for the target journal and adopting a specialized gazetteer for place names improves on the baseline of the out-of-the-box NER tools in our initial pipeline. It is likely that the accuracy on the Chiron data can be further increased with additional training. Given that an accurate recognition is a prerequisite for geoparsing, we plan to concentrate our effort on the NER components. We intend to progress in the direction discussed above, in particular by: a. training and evaluating models for the other languages (French, English, Italian, Spanish) b. testing the models on other publications in the portal. In a more distant future, we also intend to include support to the identiﬁcation (and subsequent linking) of other named entities of interest for archaeologists, such as artifacts, monuments and chronological references.",5,Latin Resources

The Citation Contexts of a cited entity can be seen as little tesserae that, ﬁt together, can be exploited to follow the opinion of the scientiﬁc community towards that entity as well as to summarize its most important contents. This mosaic is an excellent resource of information also for identifying topic speciﬁc synonyms, indexing terms and citers’ motivations, i.e. the reasons why authors cite other works. Is a paper cited for comparison, as a source of data or just for additional info? What is the polarity of a citation? Different reasons for citing reveal also different weights of the citations and different impacts of the cited authors that go beyond the mere citation count metrics. Identifying the appropriate Citation Context is the ﬁrst step toward a multitude of possible analysis and researches. So far, Citation Context have been deﬁned in several ways in literature, related to different purposes, domains and applications. In this paper we present different dimensions of Citation Context investigated by researchers through the years in order to provide an introductory review of the topic to anyone approaching this subject.","Researchers consider as Citation Context (CC) different snippets of text around a citation marker. These differences of width inﬂuence the applications that exploit CC as source of information. For example, Qazvinian and Radev (2010) showed that using also implicit citations (i.e. sentences that contain information about a speciﬁc secondary source but do not explicitly cite it) for generating surveys, rather than citing sentences alone, improve the results. Ritchie et al. (2008) compared different widths of CC in order to ﬁnd the most appropriate window for identifying Index Terms. They proved that varying the context from which the Index Terms are gathered has a signiﬁcant effect on retrieval effectiveness. Aljaber et al. (2010) tested different sizes of CC for a document clustering experiment. They claimed that a window size of 50 words from either side of the citation marker works better than taking 10 or 30 terms or the citing sentence alone, whatever its size is. From their analysis, relevant synonymous and related vocabulary extracted from this window of text, in combination with an original full-text representation of the cited document, are effective for document clustering. We can claim that the issue of ﬁnding the optimal CC for a speciﬁc application is a challenging task that interests researchers and which is at the base of every study that exploits the CC as a source of information. 1 With the purpose of providing a useful background to anyone approaching this question, in the following sections we give an overview of different dimensions of textual CC investigated in literature. We classiﬁed them in 3 main categories: a) ﬁxed number of characters b) citing sentence c) extended context (ﬁxed and adaptive), and we summarized our analysis in Figure1. We focus on the strategies to identify the correct textual CC of a citation, nevertheless other CC related topics have been investigated in literature as for example citation recommendations (see Farber (2018) and Ebesu (2017)) The belief of the need of a clear introductory survey about how CC has been differently shaped in literature came to our mind when we faced the problem of deﬁning the optimal CC for the Semantic Coloring of Academic References (SCAR) project1 (Di Iorio et al., 2018). The goal of the SCAR project is to enrich bibliographies of scientiﬁc articles by adding explicit meta data about individual bibliographic entries and to characterize these entries according to multiple criteria. With this purpose, we are studying a set of properties to support the automatic characterization of bibliographic entries and one of our primary source of information is the textual content around citation markers, i.e. the CC. We are currently investigating on ﬁnding the best span of text for our needs. By reviewing the literature, we realized that different approaches correspond to different tasks and are also related to the linguistic domain of application. The SCAR project as well as this review are focused on the English language but it would be interesting to extend this study to other languages.","We have reviewed what we consider the most interesting works about CC identiﬁcation in order to provide a solid background to anyone interested in the topic and especially to those researchers who are facing the task of identifying the best approach for their studies. We did not compare the different strategies with the purpose of ranking them, but we rather showed that there exists various relations between a methodology and the usage, domain, and language speciﬁcity of its possible applications.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In this paper we present a work aimed at testing the most advanced, stateof-the-art syntactic parsers based on deep neural networks (DNN) on Italian. We made a set of experiments by using the Universal Dependencies benchmarks and propose a new solution based on ensemble systems obtaining very good performances.","Syntactic parsing of morphologically rich languages like Italian often poses a number of hard challenges. Various works applied different kinds of freely available parsers on Italian training them using different resources and different methods for comparing their results (Lavelli, 2014; Alicante et al., 2015; Lavelli, 2016) and gather a clear picture of the syntactic parsing task performances for the Italian language. In this direction seems relevant to cite the EVALITA1 periodic campaigns for the evaluation of constituency and dependency parsers devoted to the syntactic analysis of Italian (Bosco and Mazzei, 2011; Bosco et al., 2014). Other studies regarding the syntactic parsing of Italian tried to enhance the parsing performances by building some kind of ensemble systems (Lavelli, 2013; Mazzei, 2015). 1http://www.evalita.it By looking at the cited papers we can observe that they evaluated the state-of-the-art parsers before the “neural net revolution” not including the last improvements proposed by new research studies. The goal of this paper is twofold: ﬁrst, we would like to test the effectiveness of parsers based on the newly-proposed technologies, mainly deep neural networks, on Italian, and, second, we would like to propose an ensemble system able to further improve the neural parsers performances when parsing Italian texts.","We have studied the performances of some neural dependency parsers on generic and social media domain. Using the predictions of each single parser we combined the best outcomes to improve the performance in various ways. The ensemble models are more efﬁcient on corpora built using in-domain data (social media), giving an improvement of ∼1% in UAS and ∼2.5% in LAS.Thanks to the number of parser models adopted in the experiments it has been possible to verify that the performances of the ensemble models increase as the number of parsers grows. The improvement of LAS is, in most cases, at least twice the value of UAS. This could mean that ensemble models catch with better precision the type of dependency relations rather than headdependent relations.

This process is performed semiautomatically by exploiting the morphological properties of lemmas, a previously available word list enhanced with inﬂectional information, and the contents of the lexical entries of Du Cange.","Introduction Introduction Latin raises particular challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Given that accuracy rates of stochastic NLP tools heavily depend on the training set on which their models are built, this becomes a particularly problematic issue when Latin is concerned, because Latin texts show an enormous linguistic variety resulting from (a) a wide time span (covering more than two millennia), (b) a large set of genres (ranging from literary to philosophical, historical and documentary texts) and (c) a big diatopic diversity (spread all over Europe and beyond). Such complexity impacts NLP to the point that building NLP tools claiming to be suitable for all Latin varieties is an unrealistic task. One practical example comes from an experiment described by Ponti and Passarotti (2016), who show that the performance of a dependency parser trained on Medieval Latin data drops dramatically when the same trained model is applied to texts from the Classical era. This issue affects all layers of linguistic annotation, including fundamental ones, like lemmatisation and morphological analysis. Today, a handful of morphological analysers are available for Latin, chieﬂy Words,1 LEMLAT 3.0,2 Morpheus3 –reimplemented in 2013 as Parsley4–, the PROIEL Latin morphology system5 and LatMor.6 Although LEMLAT, together with LatMor,7 has proved to be the best performing morphological analyser for Latin and the one boasting the largest lexical basis, its lexical coverage is still limited to Classical and Late Latin only. First released as a morphological lemmatiser at the end of the 1980s at ILC-CNR in Pisa (Bozzi and Cappelli, 1990; Marinone, 1990, v 1.0), where it was enhanced with morphological features between 2002 and 2005 (Passarotti, 2004, v 2.0), LEMLAT relies on a lexical basis resulting from the collation of three Latin dictionaries (Georges and Georges, 1913 1918; Glare, 1982; Gradenwitz, 1904) for a total of 40 014 lexical entries and 43 432 lemmas, as more than one lemma can be included in one lexical entry. This lexical basis was further enlarged in version 3.0 of LEMLAT by semiautomatically adding most of the Onomasticon (26 415 lemmas out of 28 178) provided by the 5th edition of the Forcellini dictionary (Budassi and Passarotti, 2016). In order to equip LEMLAT to process Latin texts beyond the Classical period, we recently enhanced its lexical basis with the lexical entries from a large reference glossary for Medieval Latin, namely the Glossarium Mediae et Inﬁmae Latinitatis by Du Cange et alii (1883 1887, hereafter DC). This paper details the process performed to include DC in LEMLAT’s lexical basis.","In this paper we present the rule-based process performed to semi-automatically enhance the Latin morphological analyser LEMLAT with the Du Cange glossary. While dated, such an approach is still necessary if the intent is to minimise the error rate resulting from the automatic PoStagging of the glossary’s deﬁnitions and quotations. Indeed, unless tuned on an in-domain training set, existing stochastic PoS-taggers for Latin are not yet reliable enough when it comes to processing the complex, raw and “freestyle” deﬁnitions of DC. The ever-growing availability of digitised Latin texts from various eras urges us to build NLP tools capable of automatically analysing such varied sets of linguistic data. In this respect, enhancing the lexical basis of LEMLAT with a Medieval Latin dictionary is a ﬁrst step towards the development of well-performing tools on diachronic data. Conversely, even if building a tool suitable for different diachronic varieties of Latin were feasible for low-level annotation tasks (like e. g. lemmatisation and morphological analysis), this does not seem to be the case for tasks such as syntactic parsing or word sense disambiguation, for which either highly ﬂexible or highly specialised tools will be needed. This is an open issue not only for Latin. Indeed, the portability of NLP tools across domains and genres is currently one of the main challenges in NLP. Thanks to its highly diverse corpus, Latin is a perfect case-study language to tackle these problems. For the future, we plan to expand LEMLAT’s lexical database with all of the graphical variants reported in DC and possibly also with other Medieval Latin thesauri, such as the Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources (Ashdown et al., 2018), so as to improve both its diatopic and diachronic coverage. In general, we aspire to make LEMLAT’s algorithm better able to cope with the most widespread and predictable orthographic variations recorded in Medieval manuscripts and texts.17 17An introduction and an approach to this issue can be found in Kestemont and De Gussem (2017).",5,Latin Resources

The correlation is even weaker when other discourse relations are taken into account.","This paper focuses on lexical opposition and discourse contrast. We deﬁne opposition as the relation between two lexical units that contrast with each other with respect to one key aspect of their meaning and that are similar for all the other aspects (e.g. to increase / to decrease, up / down). On the other end, we consider discourse contrast as the relation between two parts of a coherent 1Part of this research has already been published in the ﬁrst author Ph.D. thesis (Feltracco, 2018). sequence of sentences or propositions (i.e., discourse arguments) that are in conﬂict. Both opposition and contrast hold between contrasting elements: the ﬁrst at the lexical level, the other at the discourse level. In the following example, a contrast relation is identiﬁed between the two arguments in square brackets; two opposite terms are found in the arguments of the relation and are underlined. (1) [The price of this book increased], while [the price of that one decreased.] Despite the two relations are per se independent, the example shows how opposition can participate in contrast; in fact, the opposites to increase / to decrease convey the difference based on which the two mentioned entities (i.e., the books) are compared, leading to a contrast. Indeed, opposition can be found in the context of other discourse relations (e.g. in the temporal relation “Before the decrease of the demand, an increase of the prices was registered”), and discourse contrast can be conveyed through other strategies (e.g. negation and synonyms “Although the price decreased; the demand did not fall” or incompatibility “She has blue eyes, he has green eyes”). However, our analysis focuses on opposition and contrast, and starts with the observation that both linguistic phenomena involve two elements that are similar in many aspects, but that differ in others (Section 2). This similarity have already been considered by works in the computational ﬁeld, in which opposition is used as a feature for identifying contrast, and viceversa (Section 3). In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of opposition in the context of a contrast relation adopting a corpus-based approach (Section 4). In particular, we study the opposition-contrast intersection by observing how frequently opposites are found in the arguments of a contrast relation in ContrastIta Bank (Feltracco et al., 2017), a corpus annotated with the discourse contrast relation. We analyze the cases in which the two phenomena co-occur, in order to understand the contribution of opposition to discourse contrast (Section 5). The investigation lead us to enrich Contrast-Ita Bank with lexical opposition. Enlarging our focus, we also investigate the behaviour of opposition in the context of other discourse relations in the corpus, by examining which are the relations that involve pairs of opposites in their arguments (Section 6). Finally, we report our concluding observations and our hint for further work (Section 7).","Through the annotation of opposites in the arguments of contrast relations in Contrast-Ita Bank, we aim at providing new insights over the role of opposition in discourse contrast. Overall, we register 23 cases of opposition over 372 contrast relations in our dataset. This number is not high and one we can expect the number to be higher in a larger dataset. However, this limited number suggests that the presence of opposites is not an impacting feature for the identiﬁcation of contrast relation in the Italian language. It is, however, quite frequent for implicit relations, suggesting that the use of opposition can be a strategy to convey contrast when there is a lack of a connective (such as but or however) that lexicalizes the relation. Moreover, we show that also the co-occurrence of opposition and other discourse relations is low. Despite, in related work opposition has been used as a feature for identifying contrast, the result of our investigation suggests that opposition does not appear to be a strong informative feature and this can possibly lead to a decrease in precision in the process of identifying contrast (i.e., many false positives are expected). Further and symmetrical work includes the classiﬁcation of the phenomena that can lead to contrast. 16Eng.: On Saturday, [departure at 7.01] and [arrival at 19.36.] 17Eng.: [.. the group has continued the work of corporate reorganization], [putting some order in the shareholdings that not tied to the core business of the single subsidiaries..]",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

This paper presents a new pitch tracking smoother based on deep neural networks (DNN). The proposed system has been extensively tested using two reference benchmarks for English and exhibited very good performances in correcting pitch detection algorithms outputs.,"Introduction Introduction The pitch, and in particular the fundamental frequency F0 which represents its physical counterpart, is one of the most relevant perceptual parameters of the spoken language and one of the fundamental phenomena to be carefully considered when analysing linguistic data at a phonetic and phonological level. As a consequence, the automatic extraction of F0 has been a subject of study for a long time and in literature there are many works that aim to develop algorithms able to reliably extract F0 from the acoustic component of the utterances, algorithms that are commonly identiﬁed as Pitch Detection Algorithms (PDAs). Technically, the extraction of F0 is a problem far from trivial and the great variety of methodologies applied to this problem demonstrates its extreme complexity, especially considering that it is difﬁcult to design a PDA that works optimally for the different recording conditions, considering that parameters such as speech type, noise, overlap, etc. are able to heavily inﬂuence the performance of this type of algorithms. Scholars worked hard searching for increasingly sophisticated techniques for these particular cases, although extremely relevant for the construction of real applications, considering solved, or perhaps simply abandoning, the problem of the F0 extraction for the so-called “clean speech”. However, anyone who has used the most common programs available for the automatic extraction of F0 is well aware that errors of halving or doubling of the value of F0, to cite only one type of problem, are far from rare and that the automatic identiﬁcation of voiced areas within the utterance still poses numerous problems. Every work that proposes a new method for the automatic extraction of F0 should perform an evaluation of the performances obtained in relation to other PDAs, but, usually, these assessments suffer from the typical shortcomings deriving from evaluation systems: they usually examine a very limited set of algorithms, often not available in their implementation, typically considering corpora not distributed, related to speciﬁc languages and/or that contain particular typologies of spoken language (pathological, disturbed by noise, etc.) (Veprek, Scordilis, 2002; Wu et al., 2003; Kotnik et al., 2006; Jang et al., 2007; Luengo et al., 2007; Chu, Alwan, 2009; Bartosek, 2010; Huang, Lee, 2012; Chu, Alwan, 2012). There are few studies, among the most recent, that have performed quite complete evaluations that are based on corpora freely downloadable (deCheveign´e, Kawahara, 2002; Camacho, 2007; Wang, Loizou, 2012). These studies use very often a single metric in the assessment that measures a single type of error, not considering or partly considering the whole panorama of indicators developed from the pioneering work of Rabiner and colleagues (1976) and therefore, in our opinion, the results obtained seem to be rather partial. Tamburini (2013) performed an in depth study of the different performances exhibited by several widely used PDAs by using standard evaluation metrics and well established corpus benchmarks. Starting from this study, the main purpose of our research was to improve the performances of the best Pitch Detection Algorithms identiﬁed in Tamburini (2013) by introducing a postprocessing smoother. In particular, we implemented a pitch smoother adopting Keras1, a powerful high-level neural networks application program interface (API), written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.","This paper presented a new pitch smoother based on deep neural networks that obtained excellent results when evaluated using standard benchmarks for English and evaluation metrics proposed in the literature. Future works could regard the intermixing of various corpora in different languages in order to test the possibility of deriving a pitch smoother able to properly work without caring about language and, possibly, speciﬁc corpora and language registers.",13,Multimodal

The experimentation is based on the corpus of Semeval 2016. In a previous work, summarized in section 4, we reported the results of a system for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) based on the assumption that in real applications a domain dependent gold standard is systematically absent. We showed that by adopting domain dependent word embedding techniques a reasonable level of quality (i.e. acceptable for a proof of concept) in terms of entity detection could be achieved by providing two seed words for each targeted entity. In this paper we explore the hypothesis that unsupervised terminology extraction approaches could further improve the quality of the results in entity extraction. The paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we enumerate the goal of the research and the industrial background justifying it. In section 3 we provide a state of the art of ABSA particularly focused towards unsupervised ABSA and its relationship to terminology extraction.

However our future investigation will rather be oriented towards full-fledged ABSA, i.e. taking into account not only Entities, but also Attributes. Indeed, if we consider that the 45% F measure is obtained on a corpus where only 66% sentences were correctly classified according to the sentiment and if we put ourselves in a Semeval perspective where entity evaluation is provided with respect to a “gold sentiment standard” we achieve a F-score of 68%, which is fully acceptable for an almost unsupervised system.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We present the results of prototypical experiments conducted with the goal of designing a machine translation (MT) based system that assists the annotators of learner corpora in performing orthographic error annotation. When an annotator marks a span of text as erroneous, the system suggests a correction for the marked error. The presented experiments rely on word-level and characterlevel Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems.","Manual error annotation of learner corpora is a time-consuming process which is often a bottleneck in learner corpora research. “Computer learner corpora are electronic collections of authentic FL/SL textual data assembled according to explicit design criteria for a particular SLA/FLT1 purpose. They are encoded in a standardised and homogeneous way and documented as to their origin and provenance” (Granger, 2002). Error-annotated learner corpora serve the needs of language acquisition studies and pedagogy development as well as help the creation of natural language processing tools such as automatic language proficiency level checking systems (Hasan et al., 2008) or automatic error detection and correction systems (see Section 2). In this paper we present our first attempts at creating a system that would assist annotators in performing orthographic error annotation by suggesting a correction for specific spans of text selected and marked as erroneous by the annotators. In the prototypical experiments, the suggestions are generated by word-level and characterlevel SMT systems. This paper is organized as follows: we review existing approaches to automatic error correction (Section 2), introduce our experiments (Section 3), present the data we used (Section 4), describe and discuss the performed experiments (Section 5) and conclude the paper (Section 6).","Our preliminary experiments brought us to the conclusion that a SMT system trained on a manually annotated part of a learner corpus can be helpful in error-tagging the remaining part of the same learner corpus: it is possible to train a system that would propose the right correction for half of the orthographic errors outlined by the annotators while proposing very few wrong corrections. Such results are satisfactory enough to start integrating the system into the annotation tool we use to create learner corpora (Okinina et al., 2018). The combination of a word-based and a character-based systems gave promising results, therefore we intend to continue experimenting with multiple combinations of word-based and character-based systems. We are also considering the possibility to rely on other technologies (Bryant, 2018). As in our experiments we only wanted to observe the range of performances we could expect, we trained our models with the default configuration provided with the MOSES toolkit and did not perform any tuning of the parameters. Future efforts will focus on evaluating how relevant the tuning of parameters can be for such a MT task. The choice of training data for our experiments was dictated by the availability of high-quality resources.

In this paper we describe and review the algorithm development of the concept tagging (a.k.a. slot ﬁlling or entity extraction) task. It aims at computing a sequence of concept units, C = c1..cM, from a sequence of words in natural language, W = w1..wN. The task can be seen as a structured learning problem where words are the input and concepts are the output labels. In other words, the objective is to map a sentence (utterance) “I want to go from Boston to Atlanta on Monday” to the sequence of domain labels “null null null null null fromloc.city null toloc.city null depart date.day name”, that would allow to identify, for instance that Boston is a departure city . Difﬁculties may arise from different factors, such as the variable token span of concepts, the long-distance word dependencies, a large and ever changing vocabulary, or subtle semantic implications that might be hard to capture at a surface level or without some prior context knowledge. Since the early nineties (Pieraccini and Levin, 1992), the task has been designed as a core component of the natural language understanding process in domain-limited conversational systems. Over the years, algorithms have been developed for generative, discriminative and, more recently, for deep learning frameworks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the algorithms, their parameters and their respective state-of-the-art performances. We discuss the relative advantages and differences amongst algorithms in terms of performances and statistical variability and the optimal parameter settings. Last but not least, we have designed and provided a repository of the data, algorithms, implementations and parameter settings on two public datasets. The GitHub repository1 is intended as a reference both for practitioners and for algorithm development researchers. With the conversational AI gaining popularity, the area of NLU is too vast to mention all relevant or even recent studies. Moreover the objective of this paper is to benchmark an important subtask of NLU, concept tagging used by advanced conversational systems. We benchmark generative, discriminative and deep learning approaches to NLU, the work is in-line with the works of (Raymond and Riccardi, 2007; Mesnil et al., 2015; Bechet and Raymond, 2018). Unlike previously mentioned comparative performance analysis, in this paper, we benchmark deep learning architectures and compare them to a generative and traditional discriminative algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst comprehensive comparison of concept tagging algorithms at this scale on public datasets and shared algorithm implementations (and their parameter settings).","One of the main outcomes of our experiments is that sequence-level optimization is key to achieve the best performance. Moreover, augmenting any neural architecture with a CRF layer on top has a very low cost in terms of parameters and a very good return in terms of performance. Our best performing models (in terms of average F1) are LSTM-CRF and LSTM-CRF-CHAR-REP. In general we may say that adding a sequence level control to different type of NN architectures leads to very good model performances. Another important observation is the variance of performance of NN models with respect to initialization parameters. Consequently, we strongly believe that this variability should be taken into consideration and reported (with the lowest and highest performances) to improve the reliability and replicability of the published results.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Distributional semantic models (DSM) are widely used in psycholinguistic research to automatically assess the degree of semantic relatedness between words. Model estimates strongly correlate with human similarity judgements and offer a tool to successfully predict a wide range of language-related phenomena. In the present study, we compare the state-of-art model with pointwise mutual information (PMI), a measure of local association between words based on their surface cooccurrence. In particular, we test how the two indexes perform on a dataset of sematic priming data, showing how PMI outperforms DSM in the fit to the behavioral data. According to our result, what has been traditionally thought of as semantic effects may mostly rely on local associations based on word cooccurrence.","Over the past two decades, computational semantics has made a lot of progress in the strive for developing techniques that are able to provide human-like estimates of the semantic relatedness between lexical items. Distributional Semantic Models (DSM; Baroni and Lenci, 2010) assume that it is possible to represent lexical meaning based on statistical analyses of the way words are used in large text corpora. Words are modeled as vectors and populate a highdimensionsional space where similar words tend to cluster together. Meaning relatedness between two words corresponds to the proximity of their vectors; for example, one can approximate relatedness as the cosine of the angle formed by two word-vectors: cosθ = !∙! | ! |∙| ! | DSMs have been proposed as a psychologically plausible models of semantic memory, with particular emphasis on how meaning representations are achieved and structured (e.g. LSA, Landauer and Dumais, 1997; HAL, Lund and Burgess, 1996). So, they can be pitted against human behavior, in search for psychological validation of this modeling. For example, the model’s estimates have been used to make reliable predictions about the processing time associated with the stimuli (Baroni et al., 2014; Mandera et al., 2017). The technique most commonly used to explore semantic processing is the priming paradigm (McNamara, 2005), according to which the recognition of a given word (the target) is easier if preceded by a related word (the prime; e.g., cat–dog). Interestingly, facilitation can be observed both when the prime word is fully visible and when it is kept outside of participants’ awareness through visual masking (Forster and Davis, 1984; de Wit and Kinoshita, 2015). In this technique, the prime stimulus is displayed shortly, embedded between a forward and a backward string (Figure 1). Figure 1: exemplar trial in a masked priming experiment. The prime stimulus is briefly presented (<= 50 ms), between the two masks, before the onset of the target stimulus. Beside words’ distribution, one can be interested in the local association strength between lexical items, starting from the assumption that two words that are often used close to each other, tend to become associated. Yet, a given pair may be often attested only because the two components are in turn highly frequent. Therefore, raw frequency counts are often transformed into some kinds of association measure which can determine if the pair is attested above chance (Evert, 2008). A common method is to compute pointwise mutual information (PMI) between two words, according to the formula: PMI(w1,w2) = log2 !(!₁,!₂) !(!₁)!(!₂) where p(w1,w2) corresponds to the probability of the word pair, while p(w1) and p(w2) to the individual probabilities of the two components (Church and Hanks, 1990). PMI has been used to model a wide range of psycholinguistics phenomena, from similarity judgements (Recchia and Jones, 2009) to reading speed (Ellis and Simpson-Vlach, 2009). Moreover, PMI has also been shown to successfully generalize to non-linguistic fields as epistemology and psychology of reasoning (Tentori et al., 2014). On the other hand, PMI has the limit of over-estimating the importance of rare items (Manning and Schütze, 1999). Despite many DSMs use measures of local association between words like PMI to build contingency matrices, the information conveyed by two similar word-vectors is different from the information conveyed by two highly recurrent words. Cosine similarity is based on “higher order” cooccurrences: two words are similar in the way they are used together with all the other words in the vocabulary. Local measures as PMI instead rely only on the effective co-presence of two given words. Two synonyms like the words car and automobile are not likely to often appear close to each other in a given text, still they represent the same referent, and therefore expected to be used in similar contexts. Based on these considerations, PMI and DSMs can be pitted against human behavior, in search for psychological validation of this modeling. In particular, we tested how PMI and cosine proximity predicts priming in a set of data encompassing different prime visibility conditions (masked vs unmasked) and prime durations (33, 50, 200, 1200 ms).","Thanks to the help of computational methods, we provided new insights on the nature of the processing that supports semantic priming. Overall, effects seem to be primarily driven by local word associations as tracked by Pointwise Mutual Information—when semantic priming emerged, PMI effects were consistently stronger and more solid than those related to DSM estimates. This would be in line with previous literature suggesting that the behavior of the human cognitive system may be effectively described by Information Theory principles. For example, Paperno and colleagues (Paperno et al., 2014) showed that PMI is a significant predictor of human judgements of word co–occurrence. The results from masked priming offer another important insight—some kind of prime visibility may be required for semantic/associative priming to emerge. Other studies have shown genuine semantic effects with subliminally presented stimuli (Bottini et al., 2016). However, they typically used words from small/closed classes (e.g., spatial words, planet names). Conversely, we drew stimuli across the lexicon, and sampled form very large category such as animals and tools; this may point to an effect of target predictability. In general, our data cast some doubts on a wide–across–the–lexicon processing of semantic information outside of awareness.",22,Distributional Semantics

This article describes a computational text reuse study on Latin texts designed to evaluate the performance of TRACER, a language-agnostic text reuse detection engine. As a case study, we use the Index Thomisticus as a gold standard to measure the performance of the tool in identifying text reuse between Thomas Aquinas’ Summa contra Gentiles and his sources.","Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was a proliﬁc medieval author from Italy: his 118 works, known as the Corpus Thomisticum, amount to 8,767,883 words (Portalupi, 1994, p. 583) and discuss a variety of topics, ranging from metaphysical to legal, political and moral theory (Kretzmann and Stump, 1993). The web of references to biblical, ecclesiastical and classical literature that stretches the whole Corpus Thomisticum speaks to daunting erudition. In the late 1940s, Humanities Computing pioneer Father Roberto Busa (1913-2011) spearheaded a scholarly effort, known as the Index Thomisticus, to manually annotate reuse, both explicit (i.e., explicitly introduced by Aquinas as a quote) and implicit (i.e., reference to works without quotation), in the texts of Thomas Aquinas (Busa, 1980). Four decades later, Portalupi noted: Ancora pi`u difﬁcile sar`a [...] il tentativo di confrontare automaticamente tutto Tommaso con tutti i testi di uno o pi`u autori, per rintracciare in modo globale la presenza implicita di una fonte. Per fare questo occorrerebbe che si veriﬁcassero due condizioni: in primo luogo, gli autori di cui si studiano le presenze implicite in Tommaso dovrebbero essere informatizzati e interrogabili nella totalit`a delle loro opere; in secondo luogo, bisognerebbe disporre di un software molto potente e rafﬁnato. (Portalupi, 1994, p. 583) 1 Today, a once visionary task is conceivable, giving way to studies such as the present, which poses the following research question: to which extent can historical text reuse detection (HTRD) software detect explicit and implicit text reuse in the writings of Thomas Aquinas? To this end, we test the performance of TRACER, a text reuse detection framework, for the creation of an Index fontium computatus (a computed index of text reuse). The Summa contra Gentiles (ScG) was chosen as a case study because the critical edition used for the Index Thomisticus, the 1961 Marietti Editio Leonina (Gauthier et al., 1882), is still in use today and because an ongoing treebanking effort of the text will, in future, provide us with the linguistic data needed to further reﬁne the experiments described here (Passarotti, 2011). 1. Our English translation reads: ‘It will be even harder to automatically compare all of Thomas against all of the texts of one or multiple authors to check for the presence of implicit sources. Such a task would only be possible under two conditions: ﬁrstly, the texts of the authors quoted by Thomas would have to be digitised and searchable in their entirety; secondly, one would need very powerful and sophisticated software’.","This article describes a computational text reuse study on Latin texts designed to evaluate the performance of TRACER, a language-agnostic IR text reuse detection engine. The results obtained were manually evaluated against a gold standard and are contributing to the creation of an Index fontium computatus to both assess TRACER’s efﬁcacy and to provide a test-bed against which analogous IR systems can be measured and thus compared to TRACER. Our study shows that despite the known limitations of existing linguistic resources for Latin, the diverse spectrum of paraphrastic reuse encountered and its own languageagnosticism, TRACER is equipped to detect a wide range of explicit text reuse in the ScG, be that short or long, verbatim or paraphrastic, and implicit reuse only if coupled with explicit. To increase the detection accuracy, we are implementing a black/white list to give users the power to control words or multi-word expressions to be ignored or retained in the detection; furthermore, we plan on re-running these analyses with the disambiguated linguistic annotation currently being added to the text of the ScG (Passarotti, 2015) to measure its impact on this particular IR task.

We present a paradigm-based inflected lexicon of Latin verbs built to provide empirical evidence supporting an entropybased estimation of the degree of uncertainty in inflectional paradigms. The lexicon contains information on the inflected forms that occupy the 254 morphologically possible paradigm cells of 3,348 verbal lexemes extracted from a frequency lexicon of Latin. The resource also includes annotation of vowel length and the frequency of each form in different epochs.","In this paper, we describe the construction of LatInfLexi, an inflected lexicon of Latin verbs organized in lexemes1 and paradigm cells. In morphological theory, there is a recent trend towards a more realistic modelling of complex inflectional systems: for instance, Ackerman et al. (2009) and Bonami and Boyé (2014) propose that the analysis should take a full inflected form as a starting point, without assuming any segmentation a priori. In such approaches, what is investigated is not the construction of forms from smaller units like stems and inflectional endings, but rather their predictability given knowledge of other forms. This can be done by using the information theoretic notion of conditional entropy to estimate the uncertainty in guessing the content of the paradigm cell of a lexeme knowing another inflected form of the same lexeme, by weighting the probability of application of each inflectional pattern based on their type frequency in real data. To do so, large-scale inflected lexicons listing all forms of a representative selection of lexemes are needed. Such resources are increasingly being developed for modern languages – see among else Zanchetta and Baroni (2005) and Calderone et al. (2017) for Italian, Neme (2013) for Arabic, Bonami et al. (2014) and Hathout et al. (2014) for French. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no resources of this kind for Latin, although their (semi-)automatic building is made possible by the current availability of several morphological analyzers for Latin, including Words (http://archives.nd.edu/words.html), Lemlat (www.lemlat3.eu), Morpheus (https://github.com/tmallon/morpheus), the PROIEL Latin morphology system (https://github.com/mlj/proiel-webapp/tree/master/lib/morphology) and LatMor (http://cistern.cis.lmu.de). Our resource was created to fill this gap and to enable a quantitative, entropy-based analysis of Latin verb inflection.","We described the design and building of a lexeme-based inflected lexicon consisting of 850,392 paradigm cells of 3,348 Latin verbs. Our first objective in the near future is to make the resource complete in terms of lexical coverage, including the lexemes of the other PoS. The lexicon is available for download as a .csv file at https://github.com/matteopellegrini/LatInfLexi. We also plan to include phonetic annotation, by giving the IPA transcription of each form, which can be obtained semi-automatically by applying a script provided by the Classical Language Toolkit (Johnson et al., 2014-17) to stems and endings. Another welcome addition would be to account for cases of overabundance, by allowing more than one form to appear in the same paradigm cell. However, to decide which cell-mates to keep and which ones to discard, their frequency in Latin texts should be preliminarily evaluated. In this respect, it has to be noted that the frequencies in the TFTL refer to bare surface forms, with no contextual disambiguation. For instance, the frequency of veniam comprises not only occurrences of both the PRS.ACT.SBJV.1SG and FUT.ACT.IND.1SG of the verb venio ‘to come’, but also of the ACC.SG of the noun venia ‘indulgence’. To get an idea of the impact of morphological ambiguity on our lexicon, we analyzed all the generated forms with Lemlat (version 3.0). We found that only for about 23% (170,735) of the 752,537 forms Lemlat outputs only one analysis (i.e. one lemma and one set of morphological features), the remaining 581,802 (about 77%) being ambiguous. This result weakens the reliability of the frequency data provided in the lexicon. Therefore, disambiguation is needed, although this would require a very time-consuming work. However, to tackle the problem of ambiguity, a first useful step is distinguishing between cases like veniam above, which can be analyzed as an inflected form of two different lemmas, and cases where the different analyses only refer to different forms of the same lemma, e.g. laudatis, that appears both in the PRS.ACT.IND.2PL and in the PRF.PTCP.DAT/ABL.PL of laudo ‘to praise’, but cannot be a form of other lemmas. We call these different types ‘exolemmatic’ and ‘endolemmatic’ ambiguity, respectively (cf. Passarotti and Ruffolo, 2004). Cases of exolemmatic ambiguity are clearly more problematic, but they are also much rarer: only 79,490 (about 10%) of the forms in our resource belong to this type. The great majority of ambiguous forms only give rise to endolemmatic ambiguity, as can be observed in Table 4 below, where the relevant data are summarized. As far as endolemmatic ambiguity is concerned, although its quantitative impact is far greater, it could be considerably reduced in a principled manner. Indeed, it should be noted that in many cases this kind of ambiguity is due to systematic syncretism. For instance, the cells FUT.ACT.IMP.2SG and FUT.ACT.IMP.3SG are never unambiguously analyzed, because they are always identical for a same verb. Given the full systematicity of this syncretism, which holds for all lexemes, these cells could be considered as only one from a purely morphological point of view. Therefore, the problem of endolemmatic ambiguity could be at least reduced by adopting an approach based on “morphomic paradigms” (Boyé and Schalchli, 2016), where always syncretic cells are conflated, rather than on morphosyntactic paradigms. This would be helpful especially in nominal forms like participles and gerundives, where such cases of systematic syncretism are widespread. When such ambiguity issues will have been resolved, it will also be possible to exploit the frequency data in a more systematic fashion, e.g. to perform diachronic investigations on how the frequency of specific (groups of) forms or paradigm cells change across the four considered epochs, or to model Latin inflectional morphology in an even more realistic way, by considering also the token frequency of inflected forms, as has been recently proposed by Boyé (2016).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Given the ﬂexibility of the framework, it is easily adaptable to new languages provided with an UD Treebank.","The fast-growing research ﬁeld of Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) has shown important advancements in recent years. NLP tools that provide basic linguistic annotation of raw texts are a crucial building block for further research and applications. Most of these tools, like NLTK (Bird et al., 2009) and Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014), have been developed for able. For Italian, several tools have been developed during the years such as TextPro (Pianta et al., 2008) and the Tanl Pipeline (Attardi et al., 2010) but unfortunately they are either outdated or not open source. An exception is represented by Tint (Aprosio and Moretti, 2016), a standalone freely available and customizable software based on Stanford CoreNLP. The main drawback of this solution is that it is a resource highly tailored for Italian in which some of the modules have been completely re-implemented on new classes and data structures compared to the CoreNLP ones. In addition, like for the other existing resources, it does not provide an output that is fully compatible with the Universal Dependency (UD) framework,1 which is becoming the de facto standard especially for morpho-syntactic annotation, as well as for text annotation in general. In this paper, we present CoreNLP-it, a set of customizable classes for CoreNLP designed for Italian. Our system, despite being simpler than any of the above mentioned toolkits, both in scope and number of features, has the advantage of being easily integrated with the CoreNLP suite, since its development has been grounded on the principle that all data structures be natively supported by CoreNLP. The key properties of CoreNLP-it are: • UD based and compliant: The toolkit and models are based on UD and follow its guidelines for token and parsing representation. It can provide all annotation required in the UD framework, and produces a CoNLL-U formatted output at any level of annotation, as well as any other type of annotation provided in CoreNLP. • Multi-word token representation: Multiword tokens (e.g., enclitic constructions) are handled by providing separate tokens. Moreover, the CoNLL-U output can represent such information following the UD guidelines. • Hybrid tokenization: A fast and accurate hybrid tokenization and sentence splitting module replaces the original rule-based annotators for this task. • Integration with CoreNLP: Given the way it is built (including the exclusive usage of 1http://universaldependencies.org/ CoreNLP classiﬁers and data structures), the add-on can be seamlessly integrated with the latest available version (3.9.1) of CoreNLP, and is expected to work with upcoming versions as well. • Support for other languages: It provides out-of-the-box new capabilities of supporting basic annotations for other languages provided with a UD Treebank. This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present the architecture of the toolkit, whereas its core components (annotators) are described in Section 3. The results on Italian are discussed in Section 3.5. Section 4 shows preliminary experiments for the adaptation of the software to two additional languages provided with a UD treebank, namely Spanish and French.","In this paper, we presented CoreNLP-it, a set of add-on modules for the Stanford CoreNLP language toolkit. Our system provides basic language annotations such as sentence splitting, tokenization, PoS tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing, and can provide a UD-compliant output. Our rule based and statistical models achieve good performances for all tasks. In addition, since the framework has been implemented as an add-on to Stanford CoreNLP, it offers the possibility of adding other new annotators, including for example the Stanford NER (Finkel et al., 2005). Moreover, ﬁrst experiments on other languages have shown very good adaptation capability with very little effort. In the near future, we plan to reﬁne the core code by performing extensive tests to better deal with additional UD-supported languages and optimize their performances. We also plan to release the tool as well as the basic trained models for Italian. Moreover, we intend to perform data augmentation strategies to reﬁne our models and make them able to work properly also with ill-formed or substandard text input.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In this paper we describe DialettiBot, a Telegram based chatbot for crowdsourcing geo-referenced voice recordings of Italian dialects. The system enables people to listen to previously recorded audio and encourages them to contribute to building a collective linguistic resource by sending voice recordings of their own spoken dialects. The project aims at collecting a large sample of voice recordings in order to promote knowledge of linguistic variation and preserve proverbs or idioms typical for different local dialects. Moreover, the collected data can contribute to several voice-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in helping them understand utterances in non-standard Italian.","It is commonly known that Italy has an abundance of different dialects, such as Florentine, Venetian, and Neapolitan. These dialects are not only characterized by simple phonetic variation as it is usually meant by this term, but they are proper Romance languages, with a fully developed grammar and lexicon. As Repetti puts it: The Italian ‘dialects’ [...] are daughter languages of Latin and sister languages of each other, of standard Italian, and of other Romance languages, and they may be as different from each other and from standard Italian as French is from Portuguese. (Repetti, 2000) This dialectical variety is a resource that deserves to be studied and preserved for both cultural and applied reasons. The former, because it is quickly disappearing with less and less people who regularly use dialect at home and in public places. According to UNESCO “Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger”,1 there are about 2,500 endangered languages worldwide. In Italy, thirty dialects are at risk of extinction, such as friulano, ladino and veneciano.2 The applied motivation is that in recent years we have witnessed a signiﬁcant growth in the number of voice-based NLP applications (such as virtual assistants), which are currently not trained on local dialects and therefore perform poorly with a number of Italian speakers. In this paper we present a freely available tool that enables geo-referenced recording of Italian dialects: DialettiBot, a Telegram based chatbot, whose aim is to collect a large sample of voice recordings, promoting preservation of linguistic variation and its use in NLP applications. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe related work, in section 3 the implemented system and in section 4 the collected data.","We have presented DialettiBot, a chatbot system based on Telegram for crowdsourcing georeferenced recordings of Italian dialects. 17https://leaﬂetjs.com 18As of 31st of September 2018. 19Created via https://mapmakerapp.com. Figure 3: Frequency of approved recordings collected over time. Figure 4: Heat map of the approved recordings. Preliminary tests show that the system can be easily used by anyone who wishes to collect data in the ﬁeld as well as the dialect speakers themselves. The recording quality is good and the data is easily exportable to be used for further processing in the service of linguistic research or NLP applications. At the same time, the current state of the project suffers from a number of limitations that need to be addressed in future work and that we discuss next. First, the preliminary tests have not been informed by a detailed linguistic study of dialectical variation nor have we implemented a methodology for data collection. This is because the tests have been carried out as a proof-of-concept for the technology used to collect linguistic resources rather than a full-ﬂedged linguistic project. Future tests will require a more careful consideration for dialect characteristics in the Italian language, the type of data that would be most valuable (spontaneous speech vs a set of set sentences etc.) and a construction of precise, reproducible instructions for the contributors. Second, as described in section 3, we make use of a centralized validation procedure to approve a subset of recordings. However, since we have no complete knowledge of all Italian dialects we may end up accepting recordings which are not mapped to the correct location. In the future, we would like to decentralize the procedure, by delegating the approval to a higher number of volunteers spread out in all the regions, so that each new recording will get validated by the closest volunteer. Finally, the number of users and recordings collected so far is relatively modest. This is due to the fact that no effort has been undertaken so far to promote its use by researchers or the general public. Accordingly, the current goal of the project is to get support from cultural institutions (both at a local and at a national level) to help us engage the citizens in this crowdsourcing effort, as well as academic partners to further reﬁne the methodology and extend the chatbot capabilities. We believe this project could contribute to help safeguard the Italian dialectic richness and collect useful resources for NLP applications, as we intend to make all recordings openly available for other researchers to use.20 20We are planning to upload the data to the Common Language Resources Infrastructure (CLARIN).",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

This paper presents the application of a neural architecture to the identiﬁcation of place names in English historical texts. We test the impact of different word embeddings and we compare the results to the ones obtained with the Stanford NER module of CoreNLP before and after the retraining using a novel corpus of manually annotated historical travel writings.,"Named Entity Recognition (NER), that is the automatic identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of proper names in texts, is one of the main tasks of Natural Language Processing (NLP), having a long tradition started in 1996 with the ﬁrst major event dedicated to it, i.e. the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). In the ﬁeld of Digital Humanities (DH), NER is considered as one of the important challenges to tackle for the processing of large cultural datasets (Kaplan, 2015). The language variety of historical texts is however greatly different from the one of the contemporary texts NER systems are usually developed to annotate, thus an adaptation of current systems is needed. In this paper, we focus on the identiﬁcation of place names, a speciﬁc sub-task that in DH is envisaged as the ﬁrst step towards the complete geoparsing of historical texts, which ﬁnal aim is to discover and analyse spatial patterns in various ﬁelds, from environmental history to literary studies, from historical demography to archaeology (Gregory et al., 2015). More speciﬁcally, we propose a neural approach applied to a new manually annotated corpus of historical travel writings. In our experiments we test the performance of different pre-trained word embeddings, including a set of word vectors we created starting from historical texts. Resources employed in the experiments are publicly released together with the model that achieved the best results in our task1.","Conclusions and Future Works Conclusions and Future Works In this paper we presented the application of a neural architecture to the automatic identiﬁcation of place names in historical texts. We chose to work on an under-investigated text genre, namely travel writings, that presents a set of speciﬁc linguistic features making the NER task particularly challenging. The deep learning approach, combined with in-domain training set and in-domain historical embeddings, outperforms the linear CRF classiﬁer of the Stanford NER module without the need of performing feature engineering. Annotated corpus, best model and historical word vectors are all freely available online. As for future work, we plan to experiment with a ﬁner-grained classiﬁcation so to distinguish different types of locations. In addition, another aspect worth studying is the georeferencing of identiﬁed place names so to map the geographical dimension of travel writings in Italy. An example of visualisation is given in Figure 1 where the locations automatically identiﬁed from the test ﬁle taken from the book “Naples Riviera” are displayed: place names have been georeferenced using the Geocoding API7 offered by Google and displayed through the Carto8 web mapping tool. Another interesting work would be the detection of itineraries of past travellers: this application could have a potential impact on the tourism sector, suggesting historical routes alternative to those more beaten and congested and making tourists rediscovering sites long forgotten.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

This potential will be used to mass-produce language learning material and language-related datasets, such as NLP resources. 1European Network for Combining Language Learning with Crowdsourcing Techniques, Web: (EnetCollect, 2018) We also present enetCollect’s Italian members alongside their NLP-related interests. Indeed, NLP heavily relies on language resources and their availability is crucial for the delivery of reliable NLP solutions. Due to high costs of production, resources are often missing, especially for lesser used languages. As enetCollect researches new approaches to tackle such issues, it is a project of particular interest for the Italian NLP community. EnetCollect connects to ongoing crowdsourcing research, including Games With A Purpose approaches (Chamberlain et al., 2013; Lafourcade et al., 2015) for collecting data through gamiﬁed tasks (cf. e.g. JeuxDeMots (Lafourcade, 2007), or ZombiLingo (Guillaume et al., 2016)), collaborative approaches such as Wisdom-of-the-Crowd initiatives (e.g. dict.cc2, Wiktionary3, and Duolingo (von Ahn, 2013)), or general Human-based Computation activities (implemented through platforms like Zooniverse4, Crowd4u5, etc.).

Agreement indexes are widely used in Computational Linguistics and NLP to assess the reliability of annotation tasks. The paper aims at reviewing the literature on the topic, illustrating chance-corrected coefficients and their interpretation.","The construction of linguistic resources, and more generally the annotation of data, implies the formulation of subjective judgments. The need to determine to what extent such judgments are reliable and reproducible has become increasingly important, to the point of making validation procedures a consolidated practice. This has happened in computational linguistics (CL) with over 30 years of delay compared to psychometrics: already in 1960, Cohen, in a famous article, wrote: ""Because the categorizing of the units is a consequence of some complex judgment process performed by a ‘two-legged meter’ [...], it becomes important to determine the extent to which these judgments are reproducible, i.e., reliable."" (Cohen, 1960: 37) It is a fairly widespread belief that a high level of Inter-Annotator Agreement (henceforth: I.A.A.) between annotators is indicative of the goodness and reproducibility of an annotation paradigm. As Di Eugenio underlines: ""This raises the question of how to evaluate the ‘goodness’ of a coding scheme. One way of doing so is to assess its reliability, namely, to assess whether different coders can reach a satisfying level of agreement with each other when they use the coding manual on the same data."" (Di Eugenio, 2000: 441) The basic assumption, therefore, is that data can be considered ""reliable"" if two or more annotators agree in identifying a linguistic phenomenon or in assigning a category to the item under analysis. From this perspective, reliability thus becomes a prerequisite for demonstrating the validity of a coding scheme, and broad consensus among annotators is taken as a guarantee of the intrinsic accuracy of the annotation process (Warrens, 2010). ""The main reason for the analysis of annotation quality is to obtain a measure of the ‘trustworthiness’ of annotations. [...] Only if we can trust that annotations are provided in a consistent and reproducible manner, can we be sure that conclusions drawn from such data are likewise reliable and that the subsequent usage of annotations is not negatively influenced by inconsistencies and errors in the data. Inter-annotator (or inter-coder) agreement has become the quasi-standard procedure for testing the accuracy of manual annotations."" (Bayerl & Paul, 2011: 700) In the computational field, I.A.A. is used as a means to move from annotated material to a gold standard, that is, a set of sufficiently noise-free data that serves for the training and testing of automatic systems. By convention, agreement coefficients are used to ensure the quality of the annotation procedure and the annotated material: a high level of I.A.A. ensures that the phenomenon is considered consistent and systematic, and that the validated resource is suitable for training an automatic system to perform the same task as the linguist. In reality, the idea that I.A.A. can absolutely indicate the quality of the dataset as a reference resource is fallacious: two observers can both be wrong and yet be in perfect agreement in evaluating an event: ""However, it is important to keep in mind that achieving good agreement cannot ensure validity: two observers of the same event may well share the same prejudice while still being objectively wrong."" (Artstein & Poesio, 2008: 557) It is also important to consider that the agreement typically reached by annotators varies depending on the level of experience: I.A.A. in homogeneous groups is comparable regardless of experience levels, but it decreases when mixed groups of experts and non-experts are formed: ""Implicit in discussions of inter-annotator agreement is that coders not only agree on which unit belongs to which category, but that if they agree these decisions are also correct with respect to the phenomenon under scrutiny [...]. In our study, this assumption left us with a dilemma. Our data showed that experts and non-experts could achieve comparable levels of agreement, whereas the average agreement for mixed groups was significantly lower. In other words, experts and novices were equally reliable, yet did not agree with each other."" (Bayerl & Paul, 2011: 721) Not all linguistic annotation tasks can be evaluated using the same procedures; from a qualitative point of view, at least two general types can be identified (Mathet, Widlöcher, & Métivier, 2015): • ""Unitizing"" (Krippendorff, 1980): in this type of task, the annotator, given a written or spoken text, must identify the position and boundaries of linguistic elements (e.g., identification of prosodic or gestural units, topic segmentation). • ""Categorization"": the annotator must assign a tag to pre-identified linguistic objects (e.g., PoS Tagging, Word Sense Disambiguation). The paper aims to present a brief critical review of the metrics used in this second type of task, particularly focusing on the calculation of coefficients and their interpretation.","As suggested in the initial paragraphs, a high level of I.A.A. does not constitute an end in itself, but only one of the indicators of the actual reliability of the annotation undergoing validation. It is therefore desirable that an increasing amount of data on I.A.A. for different annotation tasks be shared by researchers, in order to facilitate the emergence of benchmark values through comparison.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The results also provide further evidence that embeddings have a major impact on the performance of such architectures.","Current societies are exposed to a continuous ﬂow of information that results in a large production of data (e.g. news articles, micro-blogs, social media posts, among others), at different moments in time. In addition to this, the consumption of information has dramatically changed: more and more people directly access information through social media platforms (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), and are less and less exposed to a diversity of perspectives and opinions. The combination of these factors may easily result in information overload and impenetrable “ﬁlter bubbles”. Events, i.e. things that happen or hold as true in the world, are the basic components of such data stream. Being able to correctly identify and classify them plays a major role to develop robust solutions to deal with the current stream of data (e.g. the storyline framework (Vossen et al., 2015)), as well to improve the performance of many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as automatic summarization and question answering (Q.A.). Event detection and classiﬁcation has seen a growing interest in the NLP community thanks to the availability of annotated corpora (LDC, 2005; Pustejovsky et al., 2003a; O’Gorman et al., 2016; Cybulska and Vossen, 2014) and evaluation campaigns (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013; Bethard et al., 2015; Bethard et al., 2016; Minard et al., 2015). In the context of the 2014 EVALITA Workshop, the EVENTI evaluation exercise (Caselli et al., 2014)1 was organized to promote research in Italian Temporal Processing, of which event detection and classiﬁcation is a core subtask. Since the EVENTI campaign, there has been a lack of further research, especially in the application of deep learning models to this task in Italian. The contributions of this paper are the followings: i.) the adaptation of a state-of-the-art sequence to sequence (seq2seq) neural system to event detection and classiﬁcation for Italian in a single step approach; ii.) an investigation on the quality of existing Italian word embeddings for this task; iii.) a comparison against a state-of-the-art discrete classiﬁer. The pre-trained models and scripts running the system (or re-train it) are publicly available.","This paper has investigated the application of different word embeddings for the initialization of a state-of-the-art Bi-LSTM-CRF network to 14Note that POS are manually tagged for events, not for their components. solve the event detection and classiﬁcation task in Italian, according to the EVENTI exercise. We obtained new state-of-the-art results using the Fastext-It embeddings, and improved the F1-class score of 6.5 points in strict evaluation mode. As for the event detection subtask, we observe a limited improvement (+1.3 points in strict F1), mainly due to gains in Recall. Such results are extremely positive as the task has been modeled in a single step approach, i.e. detection and classiﬁcation at once, for the ﬁrst time in Italian. Further support that embeddings have a major impact in the performance of neural architectures is provided, as the variations in performance of the Bi-LSMTCRF models show. This is due to a combination of factors such as dimensionality, (raw) data, and the method used for generating the embeddings. Future work should focus on the development of embeddings that move away from the basic word level, integrating extra layers of linguistic analysis (e.g. syntactic dependencies) (Komninos and Manandhar, 2016), that have proven to be very powerful for the same task in English.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Identification of Nominal Utterances in Italian Social Media Texts,ENG,3,2,1,"Università di Trento, Fondazione Bruno Kessler",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Trento,"Nominal utterances are very freEnglish. Nominal utterances are very frequent, especially in social media texts, and play a crucial role as they are very dense from a semantic point of view. In spite of this, their automatic identiﬁcation has received little to no attention. We have thus developed a framework for the annotation of nominal utterances and created the manually annotated corpus COSMIANU (Corpus Of Social Media Italian Annotated with Nominal Utterances), which could be used to train automatic systems.","Syntactic declarative constructions built around a non-verbal head (as in, for example, “What a nice movie!”) are very common linguistic phenomena in many Indo-European, Slavic and Semitic languages (such as Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, Ugric and Bantu languages (Benveniste, 1990; Simone, 2013). Not all of these nominal constructions can be unanimously considered sentences, although they can surely be considered utterances, deﬁned as concrete units of actually produced text, devoid of any pre-determined syntactic or semantic form (Sabatini and Coletti, 1997; Adger, 2003; Grafﬁ, 2012; Ferrari, 2014). It has been clearly shown that nominal utterances (NUs) occur with relatively high frequency not only in spoken language (Cresti, 1998; Landolﬁet al., 2010; Garcia-Marchena, 2016) but also in written texts. Literary and journalistic prose certainly offer some ﬁne examples of NUs (Mortara Garavelli, 1971; Dardano and Trifone, 2001), but nonetheless texts produced with computer mediated communication (CMC) or, more generally, within social media, are also a fertile ground for this phenomenon. In fact, NUs are extremely important from the semantic point of view as they allow speakers or writers to provide a lot of information using only a few words (high semantic density), often without any explicit hierarchical relationship (Sornicola, 1981; Ferrari, 2011a), which is a typical feature of CMC (Ferrari, 2011b). Yet NUs pose signiﬁcant challenges when it comes to both their automatic processing, because of the absence of a verbal head, and identiﬁcation, due to the fact that they can have diverse syntactic structures, containing, for example, dependent clauses with ﬁnite verbs. So far, little or no attention has been paid to the identiﬁcation and processing of NUs in NLP areas such as information extraction/retrieval, sentiment analysis, and opinion mining. However, in order to address newly emerging challenges, these research ﬁelds could greatly beneﬁt from tackling NUs speciﬁcally. This is the case, for instance, with aspect-based sentiment analysis, which aims to identify the main (e.g., the most frequently discussed) aspects (e.g., food, service) of given target entities (e.g., restaurants) and the sentiment expressed towards each aspect, instead of detecting the overall polarity of a text span (as sentiment analysis usually does). Similarly, argumentation mining, which takes one step forward with respect to opinion mining by extracting not only information about people’s attitudes and opinions, but also about the arguments they give in favor of and against their target entities (e.g., products, institutions, politicians, celebrities, etc.), could dramatically improve by focusing on NUs, which are often used, just like slogans, as the most emphatic part of the argumentation. As a ﬁrst step towards enabling automatic systems to process NUs, we have developed a complete framework for their annotation, and have created the Corpus Of Social Media Italian Annotated with Nominal Utterances (COSMIANU), which will be freely distributed with a Creative Commons (CC-BY) licence and can therefore be used to train automatic systems. In this paper, we ﬁrst summarize the main criteria adopted for the annotation of NUs (Section 3); in Section 4 we describe the annotated corpus; in Section 5 we present the results of some preliminary experiments on automatic identiﬁcation of NUs, and ﬁnally, in Section 6, we draw some conclusions.","This work shows how common NUs are in written informal language, as well as how important they are in conveying semantically dense concepts in emphatic informative peaks, which could be useful for many NLP ﬁelds (e.g., argumentation mining and aspect-based sentiment analysis). By creating COSMIANU, an Italian corpus annotated with NUs, and making it freely available to the research community, we made a ﬁrst step towards the development of automatic tools for the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of NUs. In our preliminary experiments on NU identiﬁcation (performed using an SWM classiﬁer), with our best conﬁguration, we obtained a performance of 73.40% in terms of F1 on all NUs (i.e. including metadata). In the future, we intend to further expand COSMIANU, both in terms of its size and in terms of the annotations it includes, hoping that this will encourage more research on this extremely common, and yet almost neglected, linguistic phenomenon. We also plan to work on the analysis and automatic recognition of NUs, especially when they are used to convey hate speech, in the form of racist, sexist, homo/transphobic or classist slogans and insults.

Stepanov,Italy,Trento,"Automatic evaluation models for open-domain conversational agents either correlate poorly with human judgment or require expensive annotations on top of conversation scores. In this work we investigate the feasibility of learning evaluation models without relying on any further annotations besides conversationlevel human ratings. We use a dataset of rated (1-5) open domain spoken conversations between the conversational agent Roving Mind (competing in the Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge 2017) and Amazon Alexa users. First, we assess the complexity of the task by asking two experts to re-annotate a sample of the dataset and observe that the subjectivity of user ratings yields a low upper-bound. Second, through an analysis of the entire dataset we show that automatically extracted features such as user sentiment, Dialogue Acts and conversation length have signiﬁcant, but low correlation with user ratings. Finally, we report the results of our experiments exploring different combinations of these features to train automatic dialogue evaluation models. Our work suggests that predicting subjective user ratings in open domain conversations is a challenging task.","Introduction Introduction We are currently witnessing a proliferation of conversational agents in both industry and academia. Nevertheless, core questions regarding this technology remain to be addressed or analysed in greater depth. This work focuses on one such question: can we automatically predict user ratings of a dialogue with a conversational agent? Metrics for task-based systems are generally related to the successful completion of the task. Among these, contextual appropriateness (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995) evaluates, for example, the degree of contextual coherence of machine turns with respect to user queries which are classiﬁed with ternary values for slots (appropriate, inappropriate, and ambiguous). The approach is somewhat similar to the attribute-value matrix of the popular PARADISE dialog evaluation framework (Walker et al., 1997), where there are matrices representing the information exchange requirements between the machine and users towards solving the dialog task, as a measure of task success rate. Unlike task-based systems, non-task-based conversational agents (also known as chitchat models) do not have a speciﬁc task to accomplish (e.g. booking a restaurant). The goal of these can arguably be deﬁned as the conversation itself, i.e. the entertainment of the human it is conversing with. Thus, human judgment is still the most reliable evaluation tool we have for such conversational agents. Collecting user ratings for a system, however, is expensive and time-consuming. In order to deal with these issues, researchers have been investigating automatic metrics for nontask based dialogue evaluation. The most popular of these metrics (e.g. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005)) rely on surface text similarity (word overlaps) between machine and reference responses to the same utterances. Notwithstanding their popularity, such metrics are hardly compatible with the nature of human dialogue, since there could be multiple appropriate responses to the same utterance with no word overlap. Moreover, these metrics correlate weakly with human judgments (Liu et al., 2016). Recently, a few studies proposed metrics having a better correlation with human judgment. ADEM (Lowe et al., 2017) is a model trained on appropriateness scores manually annotated at the response-level. Venkatesh et al. (2017) and Guo et al. (2017) combine multiple metrics, each capturing a different aspect of the interaction, and predict conversation-level ratings. In particular, Venkatesh et al. (2017) shows the importance of metrics such as coherence, conversational depth and topic diversity, while Guo et al. (2017) proposes topic-based metrics. However, these studies require extensive manual annotation on top of conversation-level ratings. In this work, we investigate non-task based dialogue evaluation models trained without relying on any further annotations besides conversationlevel user ratings. Our goal is twofold: investigating conversation features which characterize good interactions with a conversational agent and exploring the feasibility of training a model able to predict user ratings in such context. In order to do so, we utilize a dataset of nontask based spoken conversations between Amazon Alexa users and Roving Mind (Cervone et al., 2017), our open-domain system for the Amazon Alexa Prize Challenge 2017 (Ram et al., 2017). As an upper bound for the rating prediction task, we re-annotate a sample of the corpus using experts and analyse the correlation between expert and user ratings. Afterwards, we analyse the entire corpus using well-known automatically extractable features (user sentiment, Dialogue Acts (both user and machine), conversation length and average user turn length), which show a low, but still signiﬁcant correlation with user ratings. We show how different combinations of these features together with a LSA representation of the user turns can be used to train a regression model whose predictions also yield a low, but signiﬁcant correlation with user ratings. Our results indicate the difﬁculty of predicting how users might rate interactions with a conversational agent.","In this work we experimented with a set of automatically extractable black-box features which correlate with the human perception of the quality of interactions with a conversational agent. Furthermore, we showed how these features can be combined to train automatic non-task-based dialogue evaluation models which correlate with human judgments without further expensive annotations. The results of our experiments and analysis contribute to the body of observations that indicate that there still remains a lot of research to be done in order to understand characteristics of enjoyable conversations with open-domain non-task oriented agents. In particular, our analysis of expert vs. user ratings suggests that the task of estimating subjective user ratings is a difﬁcult one, since the same conversation might be rated quite differently. For the future work, we plan to extend our corpus to include interactions with multiple conversational agents and task-based systems, as well as to explore other features that might be relevant for assessing human judgment of interaction with a conversational agent (e.g. emotion recognition).",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

The CHROME Project aims at collecting a wide portfolio of digital resources oriented to technological application in Cultural Heritage (henceforth CH). The contributions for the realisation of such objective come from the efforts of computer scientists, psychologists, architects, and computational linguists, who constitute an interdisciplinary equipe. We are collecting and analyzing texts, spoken materials, architectural surveys, and human motion videos, attempting the integration of these data in a multidimensional platform based on multilevel annotation systems, game engines importing, and virtualization techniques. As case of study we choose to work on the magic travel along three Charterhouses located in Campania region: S. Martino in Naples, S. Lorenzo in Padula (Salerno) and S. Giacomo, in Capri.","Introduction Introduction The CHROME project was born with the intention of creating a framework and methodology to collect, represent and analyze cultural heritage contents and present them through artificial agents whose behavior is inspired by accurate analysis of expert guides, museum curators and tour operators. These gatekeepers are those professional figures possessing a significant amount of knowledge concerning how people should be guided in the exploration of cultural contents. In this sense, they act as mediators between cultural heritage and visitors by using a set of communication strategies, both verbal and non-verbal, aimed at maintaining a high level of engagement and delivering high-quality content. The overall experience of accessing cultural heritage is greatly enriched by these professional figures: their knowledge and experience, therefore, should not be overlooked when designing artificial agents oriented to cultural heritage presentation. As this knowledge is primarily based on experience collected on the field, the CHROME project aims at recording the performance of gatekeepers in a sensible environment so that formal analysis of their behavior can be documented and studied. The result of this process (see Fig. 1), conducted jointly by humanities and computer scientists, will lead to the formalization of a model describing the behaviors adopted by gatekeepers when presenting cultural heritage. This will then be used to control a humanoid robot designed to follow similar presentation strategies. Taking in account this aim, the main goals of the project are to: collect and provide the scientific community with reference datasets to study human-human interaction during the presentation of cultural heritage by professionals; investigate the structure of the texts contained in the collected corpus in order to produce automatic approaches supporting text generation for oral presentations in cultural heritage domain; provide a reference computational model to support development of artificial agents exhibiting coherent and engaging behavioural strategies. In addition to the orality degree of the assembled presentations, special attention will be attributed to non-verbal aspects. Specifically, CHROME will concentrate on enriching the presentation with consistent prosody and gestures. Finally, another goal is to evaluate the impact of these agents in simplifying access to cultural heritage and attract visitors in cultural sites. For the realization of such goals, five research groups are involved in the CHROME projects covering different scientific and humanistic disciplines that complement each other. The equipe is highly interdisciplinary and is formed of linguists (with specific competences in prosody, pragmatics, paralinguistics, and non-verbal behavior analysis), computational linguists and computer scientists (with skills in Artificial Intelligence and Human Machine Interaction) The teams involved in the project are: • UrbanEco (Naples – Federico II) an interdisciplinary team formed by computer scientists, architects, linguists, aiming at collecting 3D architectural surveys and speech and gesture corpora. UrbanEco is also designing multimodal interaction systems; sub-partner linked to this unit is the “Polo Museale della Campania - MiBaCT” the local section of the Italian Cultural Ministry managing more than 30 museums in our region; • ILC (Pisa – CNR) will develop systems for automatically extracting and organizing linguistic and domain knowledge from domainspecific corpora; • UniSa (University of Salerno) will analyze texts and will afford the theme of prosodic analysis of spoken material finalized at speech synthesis issue; • ISASI (Pozzuoli, CNR) will afford the challenge of CH question answering and language generation for the realization of interaction models in natural language; • RomaTre (Roma, University RomaTre), will confront the theme of multimodal communication and gesture analysis. As case of study we choose to work on the magic travel along three Charterhouses located in Campania region: S. Martino in Naples, S. Lorenzo in Padula (Salerno) and S. Giacomo, in Capri. All the texts, the architectural surveys and the audio-video recordings, in other words, all the digital resources that we have and will collect and that we describe in the next sections, concern with these wonderful sites.","CHROME aims at formalizing data collection and annotation paradigms for architectural heritage, in particular the annotation regards texts, video, audio and gestures. From the annotated data, we will: i) perform correlation analysis to identify cross-domain patterns and link them to communicative goals; ii) describe how an expert presenter relates to the physical environment while she describing it; iii) identify which communicative strategies can be mimicked by an artificial agent with the available technology. Possible domains of simulation will the deictic and iconic gestures, face and gaze behaviour; iv) implement a final demonstrator adopting the formalized strategies to generate dynamic presentations for the attending visitors.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The applied methodology consists in comparing the linguistic theory with the data extracted from two different annotated corpora: UD-IT and PoSTWITA-UD. The analyzed verbs have been classiﬁed in different semantic categories depending on the linguistic theory. The results conﬁrm the theoretical assumptions and they could be considered as a starting point for many applicative tasks as Natural Language Generation.,"In this work we have applied a corpus-based approach to the investigation of the behavior of Italian intransitive verbs for what concerns the selection of the auxiliary verb. We considered two corpora, namely UD-IT1 and PoSTWITA-UD (Sanguinetti et al., 2018), annotated following the 1http://universaldependencies.org/it/ overview/introduction.html Universal Dependencies standards. UD-IT and PoSTWITA-UD are treebanks (morphologically and syntactically annotated corpora) for the Italian language. UD-IT is made up of texts from various sources, namely the Italian Constitution, the Italian Civil Code, newspaper articles and Wikipedia. It is a balanced corpus and, therefore, a representative corpus for Italian standard language. On the other hand, PoSTWITA-UD contains tweets from the social media Twitter, and can therefore be considered a representative corpus for the Italian Language used in social media (non-standard Italian). This difference allows us to investigate verbs’ behaviour in standard and non-standard Italian Language. Intransitive verbs have been extensively studied in both traditional grammar and linguistics, since they do not always follow a standardized rule for the auxiliary selection (see examples Section 2). This fact could be the reason why their status is not currently formalized enough in NLP, as long as Italian is concerned. Among the most recent investigation which use a corpus linguistic methodology for the Italian language, we ﬁnd (Amore, 2017). Our analysis starts from traditional Italian grammars and then moves to the Auxiliary Selection Hierarchy by (Sorace, 2000), a syntactic and semantic perspective on the behaviour of intransitive verbs and auxiliary selection in Romance languages. That can be useful for formalizing the studied phenomenon and thus providing Natural Language Generation systems with the necessary information regarding the auxiliary selection, which is our ﬁnal goal. Another contribute for the same systems but for what concerns adjectives has been published in (Conte et al., 2017).","The paper presents a study about the auxiliary selection in intransitive verbs in Italian. Providing that the qualitative description given by traditional grammars does not allow the deﬁnition of a formal model for the auxiliary selection, we considered a study (Sorace, 2000) that classiﬁes the intransitive verbs taking into account both semantic and syntactic features and behaviors. The long-term goal of this study is to contribute to the development of a natural language generation system for Italian (Mazzei et al., 2016; Mazzei, 2016; Conte et al., 2017). In particular, the facilities of a ﬂuent automatic selection of the auxiliary can be an important feature also in context where the realizer module of the system is used for extracting suggestions for non-native speakers learning Italian as 6English translation: If, under request of the sender, the carrier issues the airway bill, it is considered, if not proven otherwise, that he has acted in the name of the sender.

We introduce the methodology of creation and the first results of a systematic analysis which considered terminological labels, frequency labels, recurring syntactic patterns, further proposing an associated ontology.","The term multi-word expressions (MWEs) includes a wide range of constructions such as noun compounds, adverbials, binomials, verb particles constructions, collocations, and idioms (Vietri, 2014). D'Agostino & Elia (1998) consider MWUs part of a continuum in which combinations can vary from a high degree of variability of co-occurrence of words (combinations with free distribution), to the absence of variability of co-occurrence1. They identify four different types of combinations of phrases or sentences, namely (i) with a high degree of variability of co-occurrence among words; (ii) with a limited degree of variability of co-occurrence among words; (iii) with no or almost no variability of co-occurrence among words; (iv) with no variability of co-occurrence among words. The essential role played by MWEs in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and linguistic analysis in general has been long recognised, as confirmed by then numerous dedicated workshops and special issues of journals discussing this subject in recent years (CSL, 2005; JLRE, 2009), and this appears more clear if we consider as the detection of MWEs represents a real issue in several NLP tasks such as semantic parsing and machine translation (Fellbaum, 2011). According to Chiari (2012) regarding the Italian language a line of great interest is represented by the works of Annibale Elia and Simonetta Vietri (Elia, D'Agostino et al 1985, Vietri 1986, D'Agostino and Elia 1998, Vietri 2004). Finally the discussion concerning the MWEs in Italian lexicography has been systematized in the GRADIT (De Mauro 1999) which records 132.000 different MWEs, whose collection was coordinated by Annibale Elia at the Department of Communication Sciences of the University of Salerno.

In this paper, we pursue this objective by exploiting, for the ﬁrst time in APE, the Transformer architecture. Our approach is much simpler than the best current solutions, which are based on ensembling multiple models and adding a ﬁnal hypothesis re-ranking step. We evaluate our Transformer-based system on the English-German data released for the WMT 2017 APE shared task, achieving results that outperform the state of the art with a simpler architecture suitable for industrial applications.","Introduction Introduction Automatic post-editing (APE) (Simard et al., 2007b; Simard et al., 2007a; Simard et al., 2009) is the task of ﬁxing errors in a machine-translated text by learning from human corrections. It has shown to be useful for various tasks like domain adaptation (Isabelle et al., 2007) and for reducing time, effort and the overall costs of human translation in industry environments (Aziz et al., 2012). Recent approaches to the task have shown that better results can be obtained by neural multisource models that perform the automatic correction of raw MT output by also considering information from the corresponding source sentence (Chatterjee et al., 2015; Pal et al., 2016). However, state-of-the-art APE solutions employ pipelined architectures (Bojar et al., 2017) whose complexity reduces their usability in industrial settings. Indeed, current top systems typically rely on ensembling multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and performing a ﬁnal re-ranking step (Chatterjee et al., 2017) to select the most promising correction hypothesis. Though competitive, such architectures require training and maintaining multiple components, involving costs that reduce their appeal from the industry perspective. In this paper, we address this issue, aiming at a method that is suitable for industry applications, in which a single trainable network is preferable to multiple, independently-trained components. Our main contributions are the following: • We introduce, for the ﬁrst time in APE, a Transformer-based architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) that considerably reduces system complexity (thus being efﬁcient and easy to train and maintain); • In doing so, we modify the Transformer architecture to incorporate multiple encoders, thereby considering also source-side information to increase correction accuracy; • On shared data sets, we report evaluation results that are comparable (less than 0.5 BLEU score points in the worst case) to those of computationally-intensive state-of-the-art systems based on model ensembling and hypothesis reranking.","Conclusion Conclusion We developed and used a multi-source Transformer architecture for neural Automatic Postediting. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art systems for APE, which are based on RNN architectures that typically comprise multiple components, we used a single model which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. This solution is particularly suitable for industrial sectors, where maintaining different components is costly and inefﬁcient. Our experiments show that our simplest model has comparable results to the best RNN systems, while the best one can even perform slightly better. This sets the new state of the art in APE and conﬁrms the superiority of Transformer in sequence-to-sequence learning tasks.",10,Machine Translation

Emotions play an important role in argumentation as humans mix rational and emotional attitudes when they argue with each other to take decisions. The SEEMPAD project aims at investigating the role of emotions in human argumentation. In this paper, we present a resource resulting from two ﬁeld experiments involving humans in debates, where arguments put forward during such debates are annotated with the emotions felt by the participants. In addition, in the second experiment, one of the debaters plays the role of the persuader, to convince the other participants about the goodness of her viewpoint applying different persuasion strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst dataset of arguments annotated with the emotions collected from the participants of a debate, using facial emotion recognition tools.","Argumentation in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is deﬁned as a formal framework to support decision making (Rahwan and Simari, 2009; Atkinson et al., 2017). In this context, argumentation is used to achieve the so called critical thinking. However, humans are proved to behave differently as they mix rational and emotional attitudes. In order to study the role emotions play in argumentation, we proposed an empirical evaluation of the connection between argumentation and emotions in online debate interactions (Villata et al., 2017; Villata et al., 2018). In particular, in the context of the SEEMPAD project,1 we designed a ﬁeld experiment (Villata et al., 2017) with human participants which investigates the correspondences between the arguments and their relations (i.e., support and attack) put forward during a debate, and the emotions detected by facial emotion recognition systems in the debaters. In addition, given the importance of persuasion in argumentation, we also designed a second ﬁeld experiment (Villata et al., 2018) to study the correlation between the arguments, the relations between them, the emotions detected on the participants, and one of the classical persuasion strategies proposed by Aristotle in rethoric (i.e., logos, ethos, and pathos), played by some participants in the debate to convince the others. In our studies, we selected a behavioral method to extract the emotional manifestations. We used a set of webcams (one for each participant in the discussion) whose recordings have been analyzed with the FaceReader software2 to detect a set of discrete emotions from facial expressions (i.e., happiness, anger, fear, sadness, disgust, and surprise). Participants were placed far from each other, and they were debating through a purely text-based online debate chat (IRC). As a post-processing phase, we aligned the textual arguments the debaters proposed in the chat with the emotions the debaters were feeling while these arguments have been proposed in the debate. In this paper, we describe the two annotated resources resulting from this post-processing of the data we collected in our two ﬁeld experiments. Our resource, called the SEEMPAD resource, is composed of two different annotated datasets, one for each of these experiments3. The datasets collect all the arguments put forward during the debates. These arguments have been paired by attack and support relations, as in standard Argument Mining annotations (Cabrio and Villata, 2018; Lippi and Torroni, 2016). Moreover, arguments are annotated with the source of the argument, and the emotional status captured from all the participants, when the arguments are put forward in the debate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst argumentation dataset annotated with the emotions captured from the output of facial emotion recognition tools. In addition, this resource can be used both for argument mining tasks (i.e., relation prediction), and for emotion classiﬁcation in text, where instances of text annotated with the emotions detected on the participants are usually not available. Finally, text-based emotion classiﬁcation would beneﬁt from the different annotation layers that are present in our dataset. In the reminder of the paper, Sections 2 and 3 describe the dataset resulting from the two ﬁeld experiments. Conclusions end the paper.","This paper presented the SEEMPAD resource for empathic and persuasive argumentation. These datasets have been built on the data resulting from two ﬁeld experiments on humans to assess the impact of emotions during the argumentation in online debates. Several Natural Language Processing tasks can be can be thought on this dataset. First of all, given that the dataset resulting from the Experiment 1 is a gold standard of arguments annotated with emotions, systems for emotion classiﬁcation can use it as a benchmark for evaluation. In addition, a comparison of systems’ performances on this data compared with the standard dataset for emotion classiﬁcation would be interesting, given that in SEEMPAD emotions have not been manually annotated but they have been captured from the participants’ facial emotion expressions. Second, the dataset from Experiment 2 can be used to address a new task in argument mining, namely persuasive strategy detection, in line with the work of (Duthie and Budzynska, 2018) and (Habernal and Gurevych, 2016).",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

This paper presents ﬁrst results of an ongoing work to investigate the interplay between lexical complexity and syntactic complexity with respect to nominal lexicon and how it is affected by textual genre and level of linguistic complexity within genre. A cross-genre analysis is carried out for the Italian language using multi–leveled linguistic features automatically extracted from dependency parsed corpora.,"Linguistic complexity is a multifaceted notion which has been addressed from different perspectives. One established dichotomy distinguishes a “global” vs a “local” perspective, where the former considers the complexity of the language as a whole and the latter focuses on complexity within each sub-domains, i.e. phonology, morphology, syntax, discourse (Miestamo, 2008). While measuring global complexity is a very ambitious and probably hopeless endeavor, measuring local complexities is perceived as a more doable task (Kortmann and Szmrecsanyi, 2012). The level of complexity within each subdomains indeed has been formalized in terms of distinct parameters that capture either internal properties of the language (in the “absolute” notion of complexity) or phenomena correlating to processing difﬁculties from the language user’s viewpoint (in the “relative” notion of complexity) (Miestamo, 2008). For instance, complexity at lexical level has been computed in terms of length (measured in characters or syllables), of frequency either of the whole surface word (Randall and Wayne, 1988; Chiari and De Mauro, 2014) or of its internal components (see e.g. the root frequency effect (Burani, 2006)), ambiguity and familiarity, among others. At syntactic level, much attention has been paid on canonicity effects due to word order variation (Diessel, 2005; Hawkins, 1994; Futrell et al., 2015), as well as on long-distance dependencies (Gibson, 1998; Gibson, 2000) proving their effect on a wide range of psycholinguistic phenomena, such as the subject/object relative clauses asymmetry or the garden path effect in main verb/reduced–relative ambiguities. An interesting question addressed by recent corpus-driven research is how language complexity is affected by textual genre. At syntactic level, the study by Liu (2017) on ten genres taken from the British National Corpus showed that genrespeciﬁc stylistic factors have an inﬂuence on the distribution of dependency distances and dependency direction. Similarly for Italian, Brunato and Dell’Orletta (2017) investigated the inﬂuence of genre, and level of complexity within genre, on a range of factors of syntactic complexity automatically computed from dependency-parsed corpora. Inspired by that work, we also intend to analyze the effect of genre on linguistic complexity. However, unlike the dominant local approach, where each subdomain is typically studied in isolation, our contribution intends to address the interrelation between different levels, i.e. lexicon and syntax. Speciﬁcally, we investigate the following questions: • to what extent is lexical complexity inﬂuenced by genre? • to what extent is lexical complexity inﬂuenced by the level of complexity within the same genre? • is there a correlation between lexical complexity and syntactic complexity? Does it vary according to genre and level of complexity within the same genre? To answer these questions, we conducted an indepth analysis for the Italian language based on automatically dependency parsed corpora aimed at assessing i) the distribution of simple and complex nominal lexicon in different genres and different language varieties for the same genre ii) the syntactic role bears by “simple” and “complex” nouns characterizing each corpus iii) the correlation between “simple” and “complex” nouns with features of complexity underlying the syntactic structure in which they occur. In what follows we ﬁrst describe the corpora considered in this study. We then illustrate how lexical and syntactic complexity have been formalized. In Section 4 we discuss some preliminary ﬁndings obtained from the comparative investigation across corpora.","While language complexity is a central topic in linguistic and computational linguistics research, it is typically addressed from a local perspective, where each subdomain is investigated in isolation. In this preliminary work, we have deﬁned a method to study the interplay between lexical and syntactic complexity restricted to the nominal domain. We modeled the two notions in terms of frequency, with respect to lexical complexity, and of a set of parse tree features formalizing phenomena of syntactic complexity. Our approach was tested on corpora selected to be representative of different genres and different levels of complexity within each genre, in order to investigate whether noun complexity differently affects syntactic complexity according to the two dimensions. We observed e.g. that nouns tend to appear closer to the root in simple language varieties, independently from genre, while the effect of genre and linguistic complexity is less sharp with respect to the other considered features. To have a deeper understanding of the observed tendencies we are currently carrying out a more in depth analysis focusing on ﬁne-grained features of syntactic complexity, such as the depth of the nominal subtree. Further, we would like to enlarge this approach to test other constituents of the sentence, such as the verb.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Sources, in the form of selected Facebook pages, can be used as indicators of hate-rich content. Polarized distributed representations created over such content prove superior to generic embeddings in the task of hate speech detection. The same content seems to carry a too weak signal to proxy silver labels in a distant supervised setting. However, this signal is stronger than gold labels which come from a different distribution, leading to re-think the process of annotation in the context of highly subjective judgments.","Hate speech is “the use of aggressive, hatred or offensive language, targeting a speciﬁc group of people sharing a common trait: their gender, ethnic group, race, religion, sexual orientation, or disability” (Merriam-Webster’s collegiate dictionary, 1999). The phenomenon is widely spread on-line, and Italian Social Media is deﬁnitely not an exception (Gagliardone et al., 2015). To monitor the problem, social networks and websites have introduced a stricter code of conduct and regularly remove hateful content ﬂagged by users (Bleich, 2014). However, the volume of data requires that ways are found to classify on-line content automatically (Nobata et al., 2016; Kennedy et al., 2017). The Italian NLP community is active on this front (Poletto et al., 2017; Del Vigna et al., 2017), with the development of labeled data, including the organization of a dedicated shared task at the EVALITA 2018 campaign1. Relying on manually labeled data has limitations, though: i.) annotation is time and resource consuming; ii.) portability to new domains is scarce2; iii.) biases are unavoidable in annotated data, especially in the form of annotation decisions. This is both due to the intrinsic subjectivity of the task itself, and to the fact that there is not, as yet, a shared set of deﬁnitions and guidelines across the different projects that yield annotated datasets. Introduced as a new take on data annotation (Mintz et al., 2009; Go et al., 2009), distant supervision is used to automatically assign (silver) labels based on the presence or absence of speciﬁc hints, such as happy/sad emoticons (Go et al., 2009) to proxy positive/negative labels for sentiment analysis, Facebook reactions (Pool and Nissim, 2016; Basile et al., 2017) for emotion detection, or speciﬁc strings to assign gender (Emmery et al., 2017). Such an approach has the advantage of being more scalable (portability to different languages or domains) and versatile (time and resources needed to train), than pure supervised learning algorithms, while preserving competitive performance. Apart from the ease of generating labeled data, distant supervision has a valuable ecological aspect in not relying on third-party annotators to interpret the data (Purver and Battersby, 2012). This reduces the risk of adding extra bias (see also point (iii) about limitation in the previous paragraph), modulo the choices related to which proxies should be considered. Novelty and Contribution We promote a special take on distant supervision where we use as proxies the sources where the content is published on-line rather than any hint in the content itself. Through a battery of experiments on hate speech detection in Italian we show that this approach yields meaningful representations and an increase in performance over the use of generic representations. Contextually, we show the limitations of silver labels, but also of gold labels that come from a different dataset with respect to the evaluation set.","We exploited distant supervision to automatically obtain representations from Facebook-scraped content in two forms. First, we generated polarized, hate-rich distributed representations which proved superior to larger, generic embeddings when used both in a CNN and an SVM model for hate speech detection. Second, we used the scraped data as training material directly, proxing 8We also experimented with adding progressively larger batches of silver data to gold (2K, 3K, 5K, etc.), but this yielded a steady decrease in performance. labels (hate vs non-hate) with the sources where the data was coming from (Facebook pages). This did not prove as a successful alternative nor complementary strategy to using gold data, though performance above baseline indicates some signal is present. Importantly, though, our experiments also suggest that gold data is not better than silver data if it comes from a different dataset. This highlights a crucial aspect related to the creation of manually labeled datasets, especially in the highly subjective area of hate speech and affective computing in general, where different guidelines and different annotators clearly introduce large biases and discrepancies across datasets. All considered, we believe that obtaining data in a distant, more ecological way should be further pursued and reﬁned. How to better exploit the information that comes from polarized embeddings in combination with other features is also left to future work.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Starting from a wide set of linguistic features, we present the ﬁrst in depth feature analysis in two different Native Language Identiﬁcation (NLI) scenarios. We compare the results obtained in a traditional NLI document classiﬁcation task and in a newly introduced sentence classiﬁcation task, investigating the different role played by the considered features. Finally, we study the impact of a set of selected features extracted from the sentence classiﬁer in document classiﬁcation.","Native Language Identiﬁcation (NLI) is the research topic aimed at identifying the native language (L1) of a speaker or a writer based on his/her language production in a non-native language (L2). The leading assumption of NLI research is that speakers with the same L1 exhibit similar linguistic patterns in their L2 productions which can be viewed as traces of the L1 interference phenomena. Thanks to the availability of large-scale benchmark corpora, such as the TOEFL11 corpus (Blanchard et al., 2013), NLI has been recently gaining attention also in the NLP community where it is mainly addressed as a multi-class supervised classiﬁcation task. This is the approach followed by the more recent systems taking part to the last editions of the NLI Shared Tasks held in 2013 (Tetreault et al., 2013) and 2017 (Malmasi et al., 2017). Typically, these systems exploit a variety of features encoding the linguistic structure of L2 text in terms of e.g. ngrams of characters, words, POS tags, syntactic constructions. Such features are used as input for machine learning algorithms, mostly based on traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. In addition, rather than using the output of a single classiﬁer, the most effective approach relies on ensemble methods based on multiple classiﬁers (Malmasi and Dras, 2017). In this paper we want to further contribute to NLI research by focusing the attention on the role played by different types of linguistic features in predicting the native language of L2 writers. Starting from the approach devised by (Cimino and Dell’Orletta, 2017), which obtained the ﬁrst position in the essay track of the 2017 NLI Shared Task, we carry out a systematic feature selection analysis to identify which features are more effective to capture traces of the native language in L2 writings at sentence and document level. Our Contributions (i) We introduce for the ﬁrst time a NLI sentence classiﬁcation scenario, reporting the classiﬁcation results; (ii) We study which features among a wide set of features contribute more to the sentence and to the document classiﬁcation task; (iii) We investigate the contribution of features extracted from the sentence classiﬁer in a stacked sentence-document system.",We introduced a new NLI scenario focused on sentence classiﬁcation. Compared to document classiﬁcation we obtained different results in terms of accuracy and distribution of errors across the L1s. We showed the different role played by a wide set of linguistic features in the two NLI scenarios. These differences may justify the performance boost we achieved with a stacked sentencedocument system. We also assessed which features extracted from the sentence classiﬁer maximizes NLI document classiﬁcation.,8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

We investigate head-noun identiﬁcation in complex noun-compounds (e.g. table is the head-noun in three legs table with white marble top). The task is of high relevancy in several application scenarios, including utterance interpretation for dialogue systems, particularly in the context of e-commerce applications, where dozens of thousand of product descriptions for several domains and different languages have to be analyzed. We deﬁne guidelines for data annotation and propose a supervised neural model that is able to achieve 0.79 F1 on Italian food noun-compounds, which we consider an excellent result given both the minimal supervision required and the high linguistic complexity of the domain.","Noun-compounds are nominal descriptions that hold implicit semantic relations between their constituents (Shwartz and Dagan, 2018). For instance, an apple cake is a cake made of apples. While in the literature there has been a large interest in interpreting noun-compounds by classifying them with a ﬁxed set of ontological relations (Nakov and Hearst, 2013), in this paper we focus on automatic recognition of the head-noun in noun-compounds. We assume that in each nouncompound there is a noun which can be considered as the more informative, as it brings the most relevant information that allows the correct interpretation of the whole noun-compound. For instance, in the apple cake example, we consider cake as the head-noun, because it brings more information than apple about the kind of food the compound describes (i.e. a dessert), its ingredients (i.e. likely, ﬂour, milk and eggs), and the typical amount a person may eat (i.e. likely, a slice). While in simple noun-compounds the head-noun usually corresponds to the syntactic head of the compound, this is not the case for complex compounds, where the head-noun can occur in different positions of the compound, making its identiﬁcation challenging. As an example, in the Italian food description ﬁletto di vitellone senza grasso visibile, there are three nouns (i.e. ﬁletto, vitellone and grasso) which are candidates to be the headnoun of the compound. There are a number of tasks and application domains where identifying noun-compound headnouns is relevant. A rather general context is ontology population (Buitelaar et al., 2005), where entity names automatically recognized in text are confronted against entity names already present in an ontology, and have to be appropriately matched in the ontology taxonomy. Our speciﬁc application interest is conversational agents for the ecommerce domain. Particularly, understanding names of products (e.g. food, furniture, clothes, digital equipment) as expressed by users in different languages, requires the capacity to distinguish the main element in a product name (e.g. a table in I am looking for a three legs table with white marble top), in order to match them against vendor catalogues and to provide a meaningful dialogue with the user. The task is made much more challenging by the general lack of annotated data, so that fully supervised approaches are simply not feasible. Along this perspective, the long term goal of our work is to develop unsupervised techniques that can identify head-nouns in complex nouncompounds by learning properties on the base of the noun-compounds included in, possibly large, gazetteers, regardless of the domain and language in which they are described. In this paper we propose a supervised approach based on a neural sequence-to-sequence model (Lample et al., 2016) augmented with noun-compound structural features (Guerini et al., 2018). This model identiﬁes the more informative token(s) in the noun-compound, that are ﬁnally tagged as the head-noun. We run experiments on Italian food names, and show that, although the domain is very complex, results are promising. The paper is structured as follow: we ﬁrst deﬁne noun-compound head-noun identiﬁcation, with speciﬁc reference to complex noun-compound (Section 2). Then we introduce the neural model we have implemented (Section 3), and ﬁnally the experimental setting and the results we have obtained (Section 4).","We have addressed head-noun identiﬁcation in complex noun-compounds, a task of high relevancy in utterance interpretation for dialogue systems. We proposed a neural model, and experiments on Italian food noun-compounds show that the model is able to outperform strong baselines even with a small amount of data. For the future we plan to extend our investigation to other domain and languages.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We present an approach to improve the selection of complex words for automatic text simpliﬁcation, addressing the need of L2 learners to take into account their native language during simpliﬁcation. In particular, we develop a methodology that automatically identiﬁes ‘difﬁcult’ terms (i.e. false friends) for L2 learners in order to simplify them. We evaluate not only the quality of the detected false friends but also the impact of this methodology on text simpliﬁcation compared with a standard frequency-based approach.","The task of automated text simpliﬁcation has been investigated within the NLP community for several years with a number of different approaches, from rule-based ones (Siddharthan, 2010; Barlacchi and Tonelli, 2013; Scarton et al., 2017) to supervised (Bingel and Søgaard, 2016; AlvaManchego et al., 2017) and unsupervised ones (Paetzold and Specia, 2016), including recent studies using deep learning (Zhang and Lapata, 2017; Nisioi et al., 2017). Nevertheless, only recently researchers have started to build simpliﬁcation systems that can adapt to users, based on the observation that the preceived simplicity of a document depends a lot on the user proﬁle, including not only speciﬁc disabilities but also language proﬁciency, age, profession, etc. Therefore in the last few months the ﬁrst approaches to personalised text simpliﬁcation have been proposed at major conferences, with the goal of simplifying a document for different language proﬁciency levels (Scarton and Specia, 2018; Bingel et al., 2018; Lee and Yeung, 2018). Along this research line, we present in this paper an approach to perform automated lexical simpliﬁcation for L2 learners, able to adapt to the user mother tongue. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work taking into account this aspect and presenting a solution that, given an Italian document and the user’s mother tongue as input, selects only the words that the user may ﬁnd difﬁcult given his/her knowledge of another language. Speciﬁcally, we detect and simplify automatically the terms that may be misleading for the user because they are false friends, while we do not simplify those that have an orthographically and semantically similar translation in the user native language (so-called cognates). In multilingual settings, for instance while teaching, learning or translating a foreign language, these two phenomena have proven to be very relevant (Ringbom, 1986), because the lexical similarities between the two languages in contact have proven to create interferences, favouring or hindering the course of learning. We compare our approach to the selection of words to be simpliﬁed with a standard frequencybased one, in which only the terms that are not listed in De Mauro’s Dictionary of Basic Italian1 are simpliﬁed, regardless of the user native language. Our experiments are evaluated on the Italian-French pair, but the approach is generic.","In this work, we have presented an approach supporting personalized simpliﬁcation in that it enables to adapt the selection of difﬁcult words for lexical simpliﬁcation to the native language of L2 learners. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to deal with this kind of adaptation. The approach is relatively easy to apply to new languages provided that they have a similar alphabet, since multilingual embeddings are already available and lists of cognates and false friends, although of limited size, can be easily retrieved online.8 The work will be extended along different research directions: ﬁrst, we will evaluate the approach on other language pairs. Then, we will add a lexical simpliﬁcation module selecting only the words identiﬁed as complex by our approach. For this, we can rely on existing simpliﬁcation tools (Paetzold and Specia, 2015), which could be tuned to adapt also the simpliﬁcation choices to the user native language, for example by changing the candidate ranking algorithm. Finally, it would be interesting to involve L2 learners in the evaluation, with the goal to measure the effectiveness of different simpliﬁcation strategies in a real setting.",11,Text Simplification

In this paper, we present a failure analysis based on terminological and linguistic aspects of a TAR system for systematic medical reviews.

This task focuses on the problem of systematic reviews in the medical domain, that is the retrieval of all the documents presenting some evidence regarding a certain medical topic. This kind of problem is also known as total recall (or total sensitivity) problem since the main goal of the search is to ﬁnd possibly all the relevant documents for a speciﬁc topic. In this paper, we present a failure analysis based on terminological and linguistic aspects of the system presented by (Di Nunzio, 2018) on the CLEF 2017 TAR dataset. This system uses a continuous active learning approach (Di Nunzio et al., 2017) together with a variable threshold based on the geometry of the two-dimensional space of documents (Di Nunzio, 2014). Moreover, the system performs an automatic estimation of the number of documents that need to be read in order to declare the review complete. In particular, 1) we analyze the results of those topics for which the retrieval system does not achieve a perfect recall; 2) based on this analysis, we perform new experiments to compare the results achieved with the use of either a stemmer or a lemmatizer. This paper is organized as follows: in Section 1.1, we give a brief summary of the use of stemmers and lemmatizers in Information Retrieval; in Section 3, we describe the failure analysis carried out on the CLEF 2017 TAR dataset and the results of the new experiments comparing the use of stemmers vs lemmatizers. In Section 4, we give our conclusions.","In this work, we have presented a linguistic failure analysis in the context of medical systematic reviews. The analysis showed that, for those topics where the system does not retrieve all the relevant information, the main issues are related to abbreviations and pairs noun-adjective and the triad of terms noun-adjective-noun. We performed a new set of experiments to see whether lemmatization could improve over stemming but the results were not conclusive. The issues remain the same since the type of relation noun-adjective or nounadjective-noun, cannot be resolved by a lemmatizer. For this reason, we are currently studying an approach that conﬂates morphosyntactic variants of medical terms into the same lemma (or ‘conceptual sphere’) by means of medical terminological records (Vezzani et al., 2018) and the use of the Medical Subject Headings (MesH) dictionary. 5 In this way, we expect that the system will automatically identify all the related forms (such 5https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/search as all the derivative nouns, adjectives or adverbs) of a lemma in order to include them in the retrieval process of potentially relevant documents.",20,In-domain IR and IE

In this regard we can say, simplifying, that the Babylonian Talmud is essentially composed of two languages which, in turn, correspond to two distinct texts: the Mishna and the Gemara. The first is the oldest one written in mishnaic Hebrew, one of the most homogeneous and coherent languages appearing in the Talmud that, for this reason, has been chosen to start from in the POS tagging experiment. The main purpose of linguistic analysis in the context of our translation project is to improve the suggestions provided by the system through the so-called Translation Memory (TM). Moreover, on a linguistically annotated text it is possible to carry out linguistic-based searches, useful both for the scholar (in this case a talmudist), and, during the translation work, for the revisor and the curator, who have the possibility, for example, to make bulk editing of polysemous words by discarding out words with undesired POS. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the state of the art in NLP of Hebrew. The construction of the linguistically annotated corpus is described in Section 3. The training process and evaluation of the POS taggers used in the experiments is detailed in Section 4. Lastly, Section 5 outlines the next steps of the research.","In this work, the tagging experiments have been limited to the attribution of the PartOf-Speech: the next, natural step, will be the addition of the lemma. Furthermore, we will try to modify the parameters affecting the behaviour of the three adopted POS taggers (left at their default values for the experiments) and see how they influence the results. Once the Mishna will be lemmatized, Traduco, the software used to translate the Talmud in Italian, will be able to exploit this additional information mainly to provide translators with translation suggestions based on lemmas, but also to allow users to query the mishnaic text by POS and lemma. As a further step we will also take into account the linguistic annotation of portions of the Babylonian Talmud written in other languages, starting from the Babylonian Aramaic, the language of the Gemara, which constitutes the earlier portion of the Talmud.

This work is focused on the current trends in designing chatbots and virtual assistants. We start from users’ needs identified in industrial surveys on chatbots. The result is a collection of guidelines and considerations which reflect the state of the art.,"Chatbots and virtual assistants are a developing field. Numerous companies are moving to synchronize their marketing, sales, and support functions in order to offer their users a positive experience that meets their expectations during interaction. According to research conducted by Oracle, ""Can Virtual Experience Replace Reality"" (Oracle, 2016), B2B and B2C brands have understood that there is significant room for improvement in their activities through the support of artificial intelligence: one of their top priorities is certainly the enhancement of Customer Experience (CX). 78% of the brands surveyed have implemented or planned to make investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Virtual Reality by 2020. With the aim of improving CX, this research aims to analyze current strategies for building chatbots and virtual assistants. Below, the needs of users regarding interaction with chatbots are outlined through a survey review conducted by major industry players, such as Capgemini (Capgemini, 2017) and Amdocs (Amdocs, 2017). Subsequently, a survey was conducted to understand which features virtual assistants should have, outlining emerging trends regarding ""best practices"" in design. The result is a set of guidelines that a designer should follow when intending to build a chatbot capable of meeting CX expectations. With the objective of a preliminary exploration of the field rather than a systematic review, the research was conducted using Google Scholar in early 2018 with the following keywords: conversational interface, invisible UI, no UI, digital assistant, chatbot, chatops, scrollytelling, conversational design patterns, question answering.","Thanks to the analysis and research work carried out, it has been possible to identify, at least at a preliminary level, the guidelines that can be used in the design phase of chatbots, specifying which of these guidelines are still under discussion and acceptance, and which have become established practices for chatbot design. These guidelines are currently being discussed within the framework of the TIM project ""Cognitive Solution for Intelligent Caring"" (TIM Technical Bulletin, 2018) with the aim of their adoption to ensure an effective CX.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

A number of smaller datasets have been extracted from the main collection and enriched with different kinds of annotations for linguistic purposes. Moreover, a few extra datasets have been collected independently and are now in the process of being merged with the main collection. We aim at making the resource available to the community to the best of our possibility, in accordance with the Terms of Service provided by the platforms where data have been gathered from.","The online micro-blogging platform Twitter1 has been a popular source for natural language data since the second half of the 2010’s, due to the enormous quantity of public messages exchanged 1https://twitter.com/ by its users, and the relative ease of collecting them through the ofﬁcial API. Many researchers implemented systems to collect large datasets of tweets, and share them with the community. Among them, the Contentcentered Computing group at the University of Turin2 is maintaining a large, diversiﬁed collection of datasets of tweets in the Italian language3. However, although the Twitter datasets in Italian make the majority of our collection, over the years, and also in the recent past, several resources have been created in other languages and including data retrieved from other sources than Twitter.

The starting point is the Italian hate lexicon developed by the linguist Tullio De Mauro, organized in 17 categories. It has been expanded through the link to available synset-based computational lexical resources such as MultiWordNet and BabelNet, and evolved in a multi-lingual perspective by semiautomatic translation and expert annotation. A twofold evaluation of HurtLex as a resource for hate speech detection in social media is provided: a qualitative evaluation against an Italian annotated Twitter corpus of hate against immigrants, and an extrinsic evaluation in the context of the AMI@Ibereval2018 shared task, where the resource was exploited for extracting domain-speciﬁc lexicon-based features for the supervised classiﬁcation of misogyny in English and Spanish tweets.","Communication between people is rapidly changing, in particular due to the exponential growth of the use of social media. As a privileged place for expressing opinions and feelings, social media are also used to convey expressions of hostility and hate speech, mirroring social and political tensions. Social media enable a wide and viral dissemination of hate messages. The extreme expressions of verbal violence and their proliferation in the network are progressively being conﬁgured as unavoidable emergencies. Therefore, the development of new linguistic resources and computational techniques for the analysis of large amounts of data becomes increasingly important, with particular emphasis on the identiﬁcation of hate in language (Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017; Waseem and Hovy, 2016; Davidson et al., 2017). The main objective of this work is the development of a lexicon of hate words that can be used as a resource to analyze and identify hate speech in social media texts in a multilingual perspective. The starting point is the lexicon ‘Le parole per ferire’ developed by the Italian linguist Tullio De Mauro for the “Joe Cox” Committee on intolerance, xenophobia, racism and hate phenomena of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. The lexicon consists of more than 1,000 Italian hate words organized along different semantic categories of hate (De Mauro, 2016). In this work, we present a computational version of the lexicon. The hate categories and lemmas have been represented in a machine-readable format and a semi-automatic extension and enrichment with additional information has been provided using lexical databases and ontologies. In particular we augmented the original Italian lexicon with translations in multiple languages. HurtLex, the hate lexicon obtained with the method described in Section 3, has been tested with a corpus-based evaluation, through the analysis of a hate corpus of about 6,000 Italian tweets (Section 4.1), and through an extrinsic evaluation in the context of the shared task on Automatic Misogyny Identiﬁcation at IberEval 2018, focusing on the identiﬁcation of hate against women in Twitter in English and Spanish (Section 4.2). The resource is available for download at http://hatespeech.di.unito.it/ resources.html","Our main contribution is a machine-readable version of the hate words lexicon by De Mauro, enriched with lexical features from available computational resources. We make HurtLex available for download as a tool for hate speech detection. A ﬁrst evaluation of the lexicon against corpora featuring different targets of hate (immigrants and women) has been presented. The multilingual evaluation of HurtLex showed also promising results. Although we are aware that hate speech-related phenomena tend to follow regional and cultural patterns, our semi-automatically produced resource was able to partially ﬁll the gap towards hate speech detection in less represented languages. To this end, we aim at investigating the potential and pitfalls of semi-automating mappings further. In particular, two possible extensions of our method involve using distributional semantic models to automatically expand the lexicon with synonyms and lemmas semantically related to the original ones, and exploiting De Mauro’s derivational rules.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The task is split into the two subproblems of word order prediction and morphology inﬂection. We test our model gold corpus (the Italian portion of the Universal Dependency treebanks) and an automatically parsed corpus from the Web.,"Natural Language Generation is the process of producing natural language utterances from an abstract representation of knowledge. As opposed to Natural Language Understanding, where the input is well-deﬁned (typically a text or speech segment) and the output may vary in terms of complexity and scope of the analysis, in the generation process the input can take different forms and levels of abstraction, depending on the speciﬁc goals and applicative scenarios. However, the input structures for generation should be at least formally deﬁned. In this work we focus on the ﬁnal part of the standard NLG pipeline deﬁned by Reiter and Dale (2000), that is, surface realization, the task of producing natural language from formal abstract representations of sentences’ meaning and syntax. We consider the surface realization of unordered Universal Dependency (UD) trees, i.e., syntactic structures where the words of a sentence are connected by labeled directed arcs in a treelike fashion. The labels on the arcs indicate the syntactic relation holding between each word and its dependent words (Figure 1a). We approach the surface realization task in a supervised statistical setting. In particular, we draw inspiration from Basile (2015) by dividing the task into the two independent subtasks of word order prediction and morphology inﬂection prediction. Two neural network-based models run in parallel on the same input structure, and their output is later combined to produce the ﬁnal surface form. A ﬁrst version of the system implementing our proposed architecture (called the DipInfo-UniTo realizer) was submitted to the shallow track of the Surface Realization Shared Task 2018 (Mille et al., 2018). The main research goal of this paper is to provide a critical analysis for tuning the training data and learning parameters of the DipInfo-UniTo realizer.","Conclusion and Future Work Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we considered the problem of analysing the impact of the training data and parameters tuning on the (modular and global) performance of the DipInfo-UniTo realizer. We computationally proved that the DipInfo-UniTo realizer can gives competitive results (i) by augmenting the training data set with automatically annotated sentences, and (ii) by tuning the learning parameters of the neural models. In future work, we intend to resolve the main lack of our approach, that is the impossibility to realize non-projective sentences. Moreover, further optimization of both neural models will be carried out on a new high-performance architecture (Aldinucci et al., 2018), by executing a systematic gridsearch over the hyperparameter space, namely the regularization factor and weight initialization for ListNet, and the speciﬁc DNN hyperparameters for the morphology module.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

In the late years sentiment analysis and its applications have reached growing popularity. Concerning this ﬁeld of research, in the very late years machine learning and word representation learning derived from distributional semantics ﬁeld (i.e. word embeddings) have proven to be very successful in performing sentiment analysis tasks. In this paper we describe a set of experiments, with the aim of evaluating the impact of word embedding-based features in sentiment analysis tasks.","Introduction Introduction In the late years sentiment analysis has reached great popularity among NLP tasks. As reported by Mäntylä et al. (2016) the number of papers on this subject has increased signiﬁcantly in the ﬁrst two decades of 21st century, as well as the extent of its applications. A wide variety of technologies has been used to assess sentiment analysis tasks during this period. In the latter years, machine learning techniques proved to be very effective; in particular, in recent years systems based on deep learning techniques represent the state of the art. In this ﬁeld, word embeddings have been widely used as a way of representing words in sentiment analysis tasks, and proved to be very effective. A relevant mirror of the state of the art in sentiment analysis ﬁeld can be found in the SemEval workshops. In the 2015 edition (Rosenthal et al., 2015), most participants used machine learning techniques; in many of the subtasks, the top ranking systems used deep learning methods and word embeddings, like the system submitted by Severyn and Moschitti (2015), which was ranked 1st in subtask A and 2nd in subtask B. In 2016 edition (Nakov et al., 2016), deep learning based techniques, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, were the most popular approach. In 2017 edition (Rosenthal et al., 2017), machine learning methods were very popular, especially support vector machines and deep neural networks like convolutional neural networks and long short-term neural networks. Concerning Italian language, EVALITA conference well represents the state of the art in the natural language processing ﬁeld. In 2016 edition (Barbieri et al., 2016), the top ranking systems used machine learning and deep learning techniques (Castellucci et al. (2016), Attardi et al. (2016), Di Rosa and Durante (2016)). The purpose of this study is to explore ways of using word embeddings to build meaningful representations of documents in sentiment analysis tasks performed on Italian tweets.","Conclusions Conclusions In this work we study the impact of word embedding-based features in the sentiment analysis tasks. We performed several classiﬁcation experiments to investigate the effects on classiﬁcation performances of ﬁve dimensions related to the word embeddings. We tested several different ways of selecting and combining the embeddings and we studied how the performance of a sentiment classiﬁer changes. Despite the lessons learned from this work, several aspects remain to investigate, such as, for example, the tuning of the parameters used to train the embeddings, and new vector combining strategies.

Speciﬁcally, we conduct a time-wise analysis of the happiness load of tweets by leveraging a lexicon of happiness extracted from 8.6M tweets. Furthermore, we report the results of a statistical linguistic analysis aimed at extracting the most frequent concepts associated with the happy and sad words in our lexicon.","The widespread diffusion of social media has reshaped the way we interact and communicate. Among others, microblogging platforms as Twitter are becoming extremely popular and people constantly use them for sharing opinions about facts of public interest. Furthermore, its worldwide adoption and the fact that tweets are publicly available, makes Twitter an extremely appealing virtual place for researchers interested in language analysis as a mean to investigate social phenomena (Bollen et al., 2009; Garimella et al., 2016). In addition, recent research showed how microblogging is also used for self-disclosure of individual feelings (Roberts et al., 2012; Andalibi et al., 2017). As such, microblogs constitute an invaluable wealth of data ready to be mined for discovering affective stereotypes (Joseph et al., 2017) using corpus-based approaches to linguistic ethnography (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006). Such analyses, can further enhance our understanding on how people conceptualize the experience of emotions and what are their more common triggers. Recent studies even envisaged the emergence of tools for monitoring the public mood 1 and health through the analysis of Twitter users’ reaction to major social, political, economics events (Bollen et al., 2009). In this study we report the results of an exploratory analysis of the language of happiness in Twitter. In particular, we perform a partial replication of the approach proposed by (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006) for mining sources of happiness in blog posts. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we extract a happiness dictionary from a sample of about 8.6M tweets from the TWITA corpus of Italian tweets (Basile and Nissim, 2013). For each word in the dictionary, we compute a happiness factor by adapting the approach proposed in the original study. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative investigation of the 100 happiest and saddest words by mapping them into psycholinguistic word categories (see Section 2). As a second step, we use our dictionary to perform a time-wise analysis of happiness as shared in different hours and days of the week (see Section 3). Third, we extract concepts most frequently associated with happy words in our dictionary, which we map into WordNet super-senses (see Section 4). We discuss limitations and provide suggestions for future work in Section 5.","We performed an exploratory analysis of the lexicon and concepts associated with happiness in Italian tweets. We leveraged a corpus of happy and sad tweets to extract a ”happiness dictionary’, which we use to perform a time-wise analysis of happiness on Twitter and to extract the most frequent concepts and psycholinguistic categories associated to positive and negative emotions. This study is a partial replication of the previous one by (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006) on blog posts. The main differences with respect to the original study are in the size, language and source of the corpus used for extracting the happiness lexicon. Speciﬁcally, (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006) rely on a collection of 10,000 blog posts in English from LiveJournal.com to extract a list of happy/sad words with their associated happiness scores, while we leverage a bigger corpus consisting of 8.6M Italian tweets. Furthermore, the blog posts were labeled as happy or sad by their authors. Conversely, for tweets we relied on silver labeling based on the presence of emoticons as a proxy the author self-reporting of her own positive or negative emotions. Our analysis of psycholinguistic categories and the extraction of concepts and WordNet supersenses associated with them reveals interesting ﬁndings. Happiness appears related to the social aspects of life while sad tweets mainly revolves around self-centered negative feelings and thoughts. In addition, our-time wise analysis reveals a mid-week drop in happiness also observed in the original study. We also observe that happiness is high in the morning and decreases over the day. As a future work, it would be interesting to investigate if time-wise analysis based on hours produces consistent results if a weekday or the weekend is considered and if emotion-triggering concepts associated with happiness also vary over time. We are aware of the main limitations of this study. First of all, by relying on microblogs we are probably able to mine emotion triggers that do not necessarily coincide with those shared in daily face-to-face conversations or reported in private logs. Furthermore, we do not attempt to make any categorization of the authors of tweets. Indeed, different target user groups could be studied to fulﬁll speciﬁc research goals and enable perspective applications, i.e. for supporting creative writing or for providing personalized recommendations based on moods. Finally, we consider only Twitter as a source of data. The same methodology could produce different results if applied to other social media. Indeed, recent research (Andalibi et al., 2017) showed that other media, such as Instagram, are also used for sharing extremely private emotions, such as feelings linked to depression. Based on these observations, further replications could focus on ﬁner-grained emotions, also leveraging corpora from different platforms and including consideration of demographics and geographical information (Mitchell et al., 2013; Allisio et al., 2013) as additional dimensions of analysis.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

In this paper, we present DARCIT, a new reading comprehension dataset for the Italian language aimed at identifying ‘question-worthy’ sentences, i.e. sentences in a text which contain information that is worth asking a question about1. The purpose of the corpus is twofold: to investigate the linguistic proﬁle of questionworthy sentences and to support the development of automatic question generation systems.","Reading comprehension (RC) can be deﬁned as “the process of simultaneously extracting and constructing meaning through interaction and involvement with written language” (Snow, 2002). Such a deﬁnition emphasizes that RC is a complex human ability that can be decomposed into multiple operations, such as coreference resolution, understanding discourse relations, commonsense reasoning 1The corpus will be made publicly available for research purposes at the following link: http://www.italianlp.it/resources/ 2Il corpus sar`a messo a disposizione liberamente per scopi di ricerca al seguente indirizzo: http://www.italianlp.it/resources/ and reasoning across multiple sentences. In educational scenarios, student’s comprehension and reasoning skills are typically assessed through a variety of tasks, going from prediction tasks (e.g. cloze test) to retellings generation and question answering, which are costly to produce and require domain expert knowledge. Given also the challenges posed by the broad diffusion of distance learning programs, such as MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), the automatic assessment of RC is becoming a rapidly growing research ﬁeld of Natural Language Processing (NLP). While much more work has been done on developing Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems (Passonneau et al., 2017), recent studies have focused on the automatic generation of questions to be used for evaluating humans’ reading and comprehension (Du and Cardie, 2017; Afzal and Mitkov, 2014). This is not a trivial task, since it assumes the ability to understand which concepts in a text are most relevant, where relevance can be here deﬁned as the likelihood of a passage to be worth asking a question about. The availability of large and high-quality RC datasets containing questions posed by humans on a given text thus becomes a fundamental requirement to train data-driven systems able to automatically learn what makes a passage ‘question-worthy’. In this regard, datasets collected for other NLP tasks, Question Answering above all, provide a valuable resource. One of the most widely used is the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). It contains more than 100,000 questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, in which the answer to each question is a segment of text from the corresponding reading passage. More recently, other large RC datasets have been released: it is the case of the ‘TriviaQA’ dataset (Joshi et al., 2017), which is intended to be more challenging than SQuaD since it contains a higher proportion of complex questions, i.e. questions requiring inference over multiple sentences. The same holds for RACE (Lai et al., 2017), which is also the only one speciﬁcally designed for educational purposes. Indeed it covers multiple domains and written styles and contains questions generated by domain experts, i.e. English teachers, to assess reading and comprehension skills of L2 learners. While all these datasets are available for the English language, to our knowledge, no similar RC datasets exist for the Italian language. In this paper we introduce a new corpus for Italian speciﬁcally conceived to support research on the automatic identiﬁcation of question-worthy passages. In what follows, we ﬁrst describe the typology of texts it contains and the annotation process we performed on them. We then carry out a qualitative analysis based on linguistic features automatically extracted from texts with the aim of studying, on the one hand, which features mostly discriminate question-worthy sentences from other sentences and, on the other hand, whether the two classes of sentences have a different proﬁle in terms of linguistic complexity.","We presented DARC-IT, a new reading comprehension dataset for Italian collected from a sample of standardized evaluation tests used to assess students’ reading and comprehension at different grade levels. For each text, we annotated ‘question-worthy’ sentences, i.e. sentences which contained the answer to a given question. A qualitative analysis of these sentences showed that the likelihood of a sentence to be ‘questionworthy’ can be modeled using a set of linguistic features, which are especially linked to syntactic complexity. We believe that this corpus can support research on the development of automatic question generation systems as well as question answering systems. Current developments go into several directions: we are carrying out a ﬁrst classiﬁcation experiment to automatically predict ‘question-worthy’ sentences and evaluate the impact of linguistic features on the classiﬁer performance. We are also planning to enlarge the corpus and to investigate more in-depth the typology of questions and answers it contains, in order to study what characterizes sentences answering, for instance, to factual vs non-factual questions.",11,Text Simplification

Abundant literature has shown that emotional speech is characterized by various acoustic cues. However, most studies focused on sentences produced by actors, disregarding ecologically elicited speech due to difficulties in finding suitable emotional data. In this contribution we explore the possibility of using sentiment analysis for the selection of emotional chunks from speech corpora. We used the LibriSpeech corpus and extracted sentiment analysis scores at word and sentence levels, as well as several acoustic and spectral parameters of emotional voice. The analysis of the relation between textual and acoustic indices revealed significant but small effects. This suggests that these two levels tend to be fairly independent, making it improper to use sentiment analysis for the selection of acoustically emotional speech.","The expression of emotions can occur through different components at various linguistic levels (Reilly & Seibert, 2003): lexical (modal verbs, intensifiers, attenuators, or evaluative elements), syntactic (e.g., relative clauses can comment on actions and behaviors), acoustic (prosody, voice quality), and paralinguistic (facial expressions, gestures). Traditional frameworks for the analysis of emotions are based on categories (Ekman, 2000) or on dimensions (Russell, 1980). The former distinguishes various emotional states (anger, joy, fear, sadness, etc.), while the latter tends to define emotions as coordinates in a multidimensional space, where each dimension represents a property of an emotional state. Among the many existing frameworks, Russell (1980) hypothesized two dimensions: valence (positive vs. negative) and arousal (high vs. low). The classification of emotional states through linguistic cues has proven to be a difficult task for both categorical and dimensional frameworks, and the interaction of the various linguistic levels further complicates the situation: it is still unclear whether the lexical/syntactic component should be considered dependent or complementary to the acoustic component. Despite these challenges, many studies have analyzed emotional speech with the goal of identifying specific acoustic correlates of various emotional states. Some studies have shown that systematic variations in the fundamental frequency (both in terms of pitch range and average pitch) accompany realizations of speech with positive valence (Burkhardt & Sendlmeier, 2000). However, other prosodic parameters also seem to play an important role in the communication of emotions: effects of intensity and speaking rate have been observed (Johnstone & Scherer, 2000); in fact, various acoustic measures (standard deviation of the fundamental frequency, average energy, duration of segments, spectral dropoff, etc.) have been used to predict the judgments of native speakers (Banse & Scherer, 1996), and various other parameters have been used in other studies (see Schröder et al., 2001, and Audibert, Aubergé & Rilliard, 2005). However, one of the limitations of these studies concerns the reliability of the data: given the difficulty in eliciting controlled emotional speech, many studies use recordings of acted speech, which often appears stereotyped or exaggerated (Scherer, 2003). In this contribution, we investigate whether sentiment analysis (henceforth: SA) can be helpful in this regard. SA, the study of people's opinions, feelings, and reviews in textual form (Liu, 2003), is a rapidly growing NLP field, also thanks to a wide range of applications, such as email classification (Mohammad & Yang, 2011), novels (Mohammad, 2011), movie reviews (Sadikov, 2009), and reviews of purchased items or services (McGlohon, Glance & Reiter, 2010). SA systems range from relatively simple rule-based methods to advanced deep learning techniques—see Liu (2012) for an overview. In this study, we examine the relationship between SA values and the acoustic characteristics of naturally elicited read speech, extrapolated from audiobooks. The ultimate goal is to extend the analysis to spontaneous speech data; however, given the numerous issues that this type of speech entails, we preferred to start with read speech data in which emotions were not explicitly elicited. To measure the degree of emotion expressed by the audiobook text, SentiWordNet (Baccianella, Esuli & Sebastiani, 2010) and Vader (Gilbert & Hutto, 2014) were used, which operate mainly at the lexical level. At the acoustic level, we extracted various (mostly prosodic) indices described in the literature. A similar analysis to this one, studying the correlation between SA and acoustic parameters, was conducted by Charfuelan & Schröder (2012) on data from a single speaker and a single audiobook. Here, we extend the analysis to 251 audiobooks read by different speakers, hoping that the results will have both theoretical relevance (study of the interaction between lexical and acoustic levels in emotional speech) and practical application (using SA for selecting non-acted emotional speech).","The correlation between lexical and acoustic indices of emotional read speech seems to be significant, but limited in scope, both at the word and sentence levels. F0 indices seem to be influenced by the valence of the sentence and the word, but the explained variance remains low. These results confirm and extend what was reported by Charfuelan & Schröder (2012) on data from a single audiobook, where moderate correlations for F0 and energy indices were observed. The data show a great deal of inter-speaker variability: it is clear that speakers use different acoustic indices to express emotional states. Moreover, a limitation of our analysis lies in the use (inevitable, given the large amount of data analyzed) of automatic transcriptions and annotations, whose errors undoubtedly introduce some noise into the data, reducing the observable relationships among the various variables studied. Finally, the absence of punctuation in the LibriSpeech corpus makes it impossible (or very complex) to differentiate between direct and indirect speech, where one might expect more pronounced emotional speech. In the future, such hypotheses can be tested on more recent corpora constructed with more specific and suitable purposes, such as SynPaFlex (Sini et al., 2008). In conclusion, we return to the theme of the interaction between various linguistic levels for the expression of emotions in speech. The results of our study suggest that the different linguistic levels analyzed (lexical and acoustic) are relatively independent of each other in terms of emotional expression. This means that, for a given sentence, speakers tend to rely on only one of the two levels analyzed for expressing the emotional state. This may be particularly true for read speech, in which the speaker is not directly involved, especially in the case of an audiobook narrator. Thus, using SA to study emotional speech does not appear entirely appropriate for selecting emotionally marked material, as it relies on the assumption that lexical and acoustic indices of emotionality go hand in hand and tend to co-occur. However, the correlation between lexical and acoustic variables for other types of speech remains to be explored, particularly for spontaneous speech—in which speakers are more directly involved with the semantic content.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

This contribution presents the novelties introduced, the results obtained and the problems that emerged during the annotation process and concerning some categories of verbs.","The paper reports on some ﬁnal results of the second edition of an annotation trial for verbal Multiword Expressions (VMWEs) carried out on the Italian language by the PARSEME-IT research group 1, which started within the broader European PARSEME project, the IC1207 COST action ended in April 20172. The initial project is expanding in this second stage of its development, thanks to a wider network of research groups, working together as one 1https://sites.google.com/view/ parseme-it/home 2https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/parseme/ of the ACL Special Interest Group on the Lexicon, called SIGLEX-MWE. In its ﬁrst edition, the PARSEME shared task released a corpus of 5.5 million tokens and 60,000 VMWE annotations in 18 different languages which is distributed under different versions of the Creative Commons license. To increase the computational efﬁciency of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, PARSEME focuses on a special class of Multiword Expressions which have been seldom modelled for their challenging nature, such as verbal MWEs (Savary et al., 2017). Many of the features of this particular type of MWE are considered to be difﬁcult to cope with, such as the discontinuity they present (turn it off) the syntactic variations they license (the decision was hard to take), the semantic variability resulting both in literal and idiomatic readings (to take the cake), or the syntactic ambiguity of many forms (on is a preposition in to trust on somebody, but a particle in to take on the task). Moreover, these units have language-speciﬁc features, and are generally modelled according to descriptive categories developed by different traditions of linguistic studies. The PARSEME research group thus addresses also the creation of a multilingual common platform for VMVEs using universal terminology, guidelines and methodologies for the identiﬁcation of these units cross-linguistically. Moreover, at the end of the ﬁrst annotation trial a shared task on automatic identiﬁcation of VMWEs was also carried out and has proved the reliability and usefulness of the data collected so far, which have been already presented and discussed (Savary et al., 2017; Monti et al., 2017). The paper illustrates the types of VMWEs used by the second PARSEME annotation trial more thoroughly. In Section 2 we provide a brief description of the second annotation trial of the PARSEME shared task together with the statistics. Then we present a new category of verbal MWEs, namely Inherently Clitic Verbs (Section 3) and in Section 4 two very productive categories in Italian (IRV and IDV). In Section 5, we discuss some borderline cases which posed some classiﬁcation issues. Finally, we conclude and discuss future work.","In this paper we described the novelties concerning the PARSEME shared task on automatic identiﬁcation of verbal MWEs - edition 1.1 (2018), in which new verb categories have been included in comparison with the 2017 edition. Some of them are language-speciﬁc, such as ICV for some Romance languages, others are not, like IAV. The increased number of categories enables to annotate corpus data more thoroughly, and discover a broad range of combinatorial phenomena that present different degrees of opacity. We also discussed two productive categories in Italian, namely IRV and VID, and analyzed LVC and IAV borderline cases together with observations on combinatorial phenomena that can be applied in order to annotate VMWE more effectively. Future work includes a further linguistic analysis of borderline cases in order to contribute to the description of these phenomena.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Experimented for the ﬁrst time in 2014, it became effective starting in 2015 with the DM 850/2015.1 The program involves all new hiring teachers from primary to secondary school for a total of 130,000 NQTs committed in the last 3 years. The underlying theoretical framework developed by INDIRE, MIUR and University of 1http://neoassunti.indire.it/2018/ﬁles/DM 850 27 10 2015.pdf Macerata is based on the alternation of laboratorial and traditional classroom activities with documentation and reﬂection activities. The purpose is “to inﬂuence practices through a process that alternates between moments of immersion and distancing, which are actualised in When I teach and When I reconsider my teaching to think of what happened” (Magnoler et al., 2016). An on-line environment developed and managed by INDIRE2 was set up to support teachers to reﬂect about and document their educational and professional activities (see Figure 1) during the induction program. All evidences of the instructional tasks (surveys, writing tasks, lesson plans, instructional materials, etc.) are collected in the e-portfolio and printed by the teachers for the ﬁnal exam. An yearly monitoring of teachers activities is carried on by INDIRE to assess the effectiveness of the whole induction program, as well as of the single instructional tasks. It is aimed to modify, whenever needed, the program in order to improve stakeholders’ scaffolding to the newly qualiﬁed teachers and lastly teachers’ professional development. Figure 1: The on-line environment collecting the e-portfolio of the newly qualiﬁed teachers. In this paper, we report ﬁrst results of an ongoing study devoted to investigate the potentialities offered by Natural Language Processing methods and tools for the analysis of the NQTs e-portfolio. We consider in particular the documents written by the 26,526 teachers hired in the 2016/17 school year. Many protocols (or models) have been proposed to assess reﬂection in teachers writing, e.g. (Sparks-Langer et al., 1990; Hatton and Smith, 1995; Kember et al., 2008; Larrivee, 2008; Harland and Wondra, 2011). These models rely on features that suggest either different levels of reﬂection (means focused on the depth of reﬂection) or content of reﬂection (focused on the breadth of reﬂection), and usually they have found to mix features of both classes (depth and breadth) (Ullmann, 2015). We rather focus here on the analysis of the form to study which are the main linguistic phenomena, distinguishing reﬂective from non reﬂective writings. Speciﬁcally, we devised a methodology devoted to investigate whether and to which extent a wide set of linguistic features automatically extracted from texts can be exploited to characterize NQTs’ reﬂective writings. Our contribution: i) we collect a corpus of reﬂective writings manually annotated by experts in the learning science domain and classiﬁed with respect to different types of reﬂectivity; ii) we detect a wide set of linguistically phenomena, characterizing the collected writings; iii) we report the ﬁrst results of an automatic classiﬁcation experiment to assess which features contribute more in the automatic prediction of reﬂexivity.",We reported ﬁrst results of a on-going study devoted to reconstruct the linguistic proﬁle of a corpus of reﬂective writings by Italian newly recruited teachers that we collected for the speciﬁc purpose of this paper.

The great majority of compositional models in distributional semantics present methods to compose distributional vectors or tensors in a representation of the sentence. Here we propose to enrich the best performing method (vector addition, which we take as a baseline) with distributional knowledge about events, outperforming our baseline.","Composing word representations into larger phrases and sentences notoriously represents a big challenge for distributional semantics (Lenci, 2018). Various approaches have been proposed ranging from simple arithmetic operations on word vectors (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008), to algebraic compositional functions on higher-order objects (Baroni et al., 2014; Coecke et al., 2010), as well as neural networks approaches (Socher et al., 2010; Mikolov et al., 2013). Among all proposed compositional functions, vector addition still shows the best performances on various tasks (Asher et al., 2016; Blacoe and Lapata, 2012; Rimell et al., 2016), beating more complex methods, such as the Lexical Functional Model (Baroni et al., 2014). However, the success of vector addition is quite puzzling from the linguistic and cognitive point of view: the meaning of a complex expression is not simply the sum of the meaning of its parts, and the contribution of a lexical item might be different depending on its syntactic as well as pragmatic context. The majority of available models in literature assumes the meaning of complex expressions like sentences to be a vector (i.e., an embedding) projected from the vectors representing the content of its lexical parts. However, as pointed out by Erk and Pad´o (2008), while vectors serve well the cause of capturing the semantic relatedness among lexemes, this might not be the best choice for more complex linguistic expressions, because of the limited and ﬁxed amount of information that can be encoded. Moreover events and situations, expressed through sentences, are by deﬁnition inherently complex and structured semantic objects. Actually, assuming the equation “meaning is vector” is eventually too limited even at the lexical level. Psycholinguistic evidence shows that lexical items activate a great amount of generalized event knowledge (GEK) (Elman, 2011; Hagoort and van Berkum, 2007; Hare et al., 2009), and that this knowledge is crucially exploited during online language processing, constraining the speakers’ expectations about upcoming linguistic input (McRae and Matsuki, 2009). GEK is concerned with the idea that the lexicon is not organized as a dictionary, but rather as a network, where words trigger expectations about the upcoming input, inﬂuenced by pragmatic knowledge along with lexical knowledge. Therefore sentence comprehension can be phrased as the identiﬁcation of the event that best explains the linguistic cues used in the input (Kuperberg and Jaeger, 2016). In this paper, we introduce MEDEA, a compositional distributional model of sentence meaning which integrates vector addition with GEK activated by lexical items. MEDEA is directly inspired by the model in Chersoni et al. (2017a) and relies on two major assumptions: • lexical items are represented with embeddings within a network of syntagmatic relations encoding prototypical knowledge about events; • the semantic representation of a sentence is a structured object incrementally integrating the semantic information cued by lexical items. We test MEDEA on two datasets for compositional distributional semantics in which addition has proven to be very hard to beat. At least, before meeting MEDEA.","We provided a basic implementation of a meaning composition model, which aims at being incremental and cognitively plausible. While still relying on vector addition, our results suggest that distributional vectors do not encode sufﬁcient information about event knowledge, and that, in line with psycholinguistic results, activated GEK plays an important role in building semantic representations during online sentence processing. Our ongoing work focuses on reﬁning the way in which this event knowledge takes part in the processing phase and testing its performance on more complex datasets: while both RELPRON and the transitive sentences dataset provided a straight forward mapping between syntactic label and semantic roles, more naturalistic datasets show a much wider range of syntactic phenomena that would allow us to test how expectations jointly work on syntactic structure and semantic roles.",22,Distributional Semantics

In this we paper present Tint 2.0, an open-source, fast and extendable Natural Language Processing suite for Italian based on Stanford CoreNLP. The new release includes some improvements of the existing NLP modules, and a set of new text processing components for ﬁnegrained linguistic analysis that were not available so far, including multi-word expression recognition, afﬁx analysis, readability and classiﬁcation of complex verb tenses.","In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies have become fundamental to deal with complex tasks requiring text analysis, such as Question Answering, Topic Classiﬁcation, Text Simpliﬁcation, etc. Both research institutions and companies require accurate and reliable software for free and efﬁcient linguistic analysis, allowing programmers to focus on the core of their business or research. While most of the opensource NLP tools freely available on the web (such as Stanford CoreNLP1 and OpenNLP2) are designed for English and sometimes adapted to other languages, there is a lack of this kind of resources for Italian. In this paper, we present a novel, extended release of Tint (Palmero Aprosio and Moretti, 2016), a suite of ready-to-use modules for Italian NLP. It is free to use, open source, and can be downloaded and used out-of-the-box (see Section 6). Compared to the previous version, the suite has been enriched with several modules for ﬁne-grained linguistic analysis that were not available for Italian before. 2 Related work There are plenty of linguistic pipelines available for download. Most of them (such as Stanford CoreNLP and OpenNLP) are language independent and, even if they are not available in Italian out-of-the-box, they could be trained in every existing language. A notable example in this direction is UDpipe (Straka and Strakov´a, 2017), a trainable pipeline which performs most of the common NLP tasks and is available in more than 50 languages, and Freeling (Padr´o and Stanilovsky, 2012), a C++ library providing language analysis functionalities for a variety of languages. There are also some pipelines for Italian, such as TextPro (Emanuele Pianta and Zanoli, 2008), T2K (Dell’Orletta et al., 2014), and TaNL, but none of them are released as open source (and only TextPro can be downloaded and used for free for research purposes). Other single components are unfortunately available only upon request to the authors, for example the AnIta morphological analyser (Tamburini and Melandri, 2012). In this respect, Tint represents an exception because not only it includes standard NLP modules, for example Named Entity Recognition and Lemmatization, but it also provides within a single framework additional components that are usually available as separate tools, such as the identiﬁcation of multi-word expressions, the estimation of text complexity and the detection of text reuse. Multi-word expression identiﬁcation is a well studied problem, but most of the tools are available or optimized only for English. One of them, jMWE,3 is written in Java and provides a parallel project4 that adds compatibility to CoreNLP (Kulkarni and Finlayson, 2011). The mwetoolkit5 is written in Python and uses a CRF classiﬁer (Ramisch et al., 2010). The word2phrase module of word2vec attempts to learn phrases in a document of any language (Mikolov et al., 2013), but it is more a statistical tool for phrase extraction than for multi-word detection. As for the assessment of text complexity, READ-IT (Dell’Orletta et al., 2011) is the only existing tool that gathers readability information for an Italian text. However, while the online demo can be used for free without registration, the tool is not available for ofﬂine use. As for text reuse detection, i.e. when an author quotes (or borrows) another earlier or contemporary author, in the last years it has become easier thanks to new algorithms and high availability of texts (Mullen, 2016; Clough et al., 2002; Mihalcea et al., 2006). However, also in this case, no tools are available for Italian.","In this paper, we presented the new release of Tint, a simple, fast and accurate NLP pipeline for Italian, based on Stanford CoreNLP. In the new version, we have ﬁxed some bugs and improved some of the existing modules. We have also added a set of components for ﬁne-grained linguistics analysis that were not available so far. In the future, we plan to improve the suite and extend it with additional modules, also based on the feedback from the users through the github project page. We are currently working on new modules, in particular Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) based on linguistic resources such as MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002) and Semantic Role Labelling, by porting to Italian resources such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), now available only in English. The Tint pipeline will also be integrated in PIKES (Corcoglioniti et al., 2016), a tool that extracts knowledge from English texts using NLP and outputs it in a queryable form (such RDF triples), so to extend it to Italian.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The modules developed to semi-automatically build e-IUDT were delexicalized to perform cross-language enhancements: preliminary experiments in this direction led to promising results.","Introduction Introduction The Universal Dependencies (UD) project, launched in 2015, aims at developing crosslinguistically consistent treebank annotation for many languages, with the goal of facilitating multilingual parser development, cross-lingual learning, and parsing research from a language typology perspective (Nivre et al., 2016). UD represents an open community effort with over 200 contributors producing more than 100 treebanks in over 60 languages. Starting from the Stanford Dependencies project, from which Universal Dependencies (UD) originate, two syntactic representation options are made available, suited to different use cases (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008): the so-called “basic” representation where a close parallelism to the source text is maintained (i.e. where each word of the original sentence is present as a node), and the so-called “collapsed and propagated” representation which was conceived with a specific view to information extraction tasks. Within the current version of UD, the “collapsed and propagated” representation has evolved into the graph-based enhanced representation proposed by Schuster and Manning (2016). Since UD version 2.2 (officially released on July 2018), “enhanced treebanks” started to appear for a limited number of languages, i.e. English, Finnish, Russian, Polish, Dutch, Latvian. In order to foster the development of enhanced treebanks for other languages, transfer experiments exploiting existing treebanks are reported in the literature, following both rule-based (Schuster and Manning 2016) and data-driven (Nyblom et al., 2013) approaches. This paper describes the approach we used for developing and validating the enhanced version of the Italian UD Treebank and reports the first results of transfer experiments to English. 2 Enhanced dependencies Enhanced dependencies were proposed as a way to simplify the process of information extraction. Enhancements, for the most part, result in additional links added to the dependency tree, motivated by inferences, which remain however anchored at the surface representation level. The result of enhancing a dependency tree is a graph, possibly with cycles, but not necessarily a super graph (since some of the original arcs may be discarded). The current UD guidelines are quite conservative, i.e. they suggest practically feasible enhancements only. Despite this, enhancements cannot always be achieved automatically, and the task is challenging enough to be interesting. Ac-","We extended the Italian UD Treebank with an enhanced representation level: Italian is now among the few languages within UD with a gold enhanced Treebank which will be part of Release v2.3.

The contribution also includes better and more detailed specifications to the constantly inprogress guidelines. Current developments include: from a mono-lingual perspective, extension of the typology of enhancements; from the multi-lingual perspective, testing and extending the enhancement component successfully used with English for other languages.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

The paper suggests that distributional properties can provide useful insights on how general abstract constructions inﬂuence the resolution of coercion effects. However, complete understanding of the processing and recognition of coercion requires to take into consideration the complex intertwining of lexical verb and abstract constructions.","In Construction Grammar (Goldberg, 2006), the basic units of linguistic analysis are called constructions (Cxns), form-meaning pairings associated with autonomous, non-compositional abstract meanings, independently from the lexical items occurring in them. Examples of Cxns range from morphemes (e.g., pre-, -ing), to ﬁlled or partiallyﬁlled complex words (e.g., daredevil) to idioms (e.g., give the devil his dues) to more abstract patterns like the Ditransitive [Subj V Obj1 Obj2] (e.g., he gave her a book) (Goldberg, 2006). Cxns appear at any level of linguistic analysis, but the level at which the notion of constructional meaning represents a radical departure from other theories of grammar is argument structure. These Cxns, such as the English Ditransitive, are claimed to be associated with an abstract semantic content. In this case, constructional meaning can be paraphrased as X CAUSES Y TO RECEIVE Z. One of the main supporting arguments in favour of constructions as independent and primitive objects of grammar is the ﬂexibility with which argument Cxns and verbs interact with each other, as in example (1) in which the original intransitive sense of “to sneeze” is overridden by the Caused Motion Cxn, and thus takes a transitive sense of “making something move by sneezing”. (1) John sneezed the napkin off the table This ﬂexibility in combining Cxns and verbs is known as valency coercion (Michaelis, 2004; Boas, 2011; Lauwers and Willems, 2011; Perek and Hilpert, 2014). This phenomenon, although vastly addressed for English, has not yet received a systematic investigation in other languages. For notable exceptions, see Boas and Gonzálvez-García (2014). In particular – to the best of our knowledge – no previous attempt to carry out an empirical investigation of valency coercion exists for Italian. However, even a simple corpus query reveals that the phenomenon is present in Italian, though it is not as pervasive as in English: (2) Tossì una risata leggera tra i suoi capelli (He coughed a light laugh in her hair) [ItWac] This paper presents an analysis of Italian constructional ﬂexibility that combines psycholinguistic and computational evidence: ﬁrst, we present the results of a behavioral experiment on valency coercion. Then, we model Cxns with distributional semantics to investigate whether the semantic shape of Italian argument Cxns can affect the interpretation and processing of coerced sentences.","These ﬁndings support our claim that coercion effects are resolved by a dynamic interrelation between verb and Cxn (Kemmer, 2008; Kemmer and Yoon, 2013). Even though frequency effects are shown to affect Cxns extensibility to new items (Bybee, 2006), our results suggest that type and token frequency only facilitate the distinction between semantically incompatible and partially compatible formulations, whereas higher coercibility is only affected by semantic density. We interpret this ﬁnding in light of the upward strengthening hypothesis (Hilpert, 2015), according to which a novel occurrence of a linguistic unit strengthens a superior node (i.e., the abstract Cxn) only if the former is categorized ‘as an instance of a more abstract Cxn. If this categorization is not performed, or only superﬁcially so, no upward strengthening will take place’ (Hilpert, 2015, p.38). Higher coercibility is hence not affected by frequency of the Cxn because of the ‘intermediate’ grammaticality level of coercion, which does not allow unambiguous categorization. Coercion sentences result more natural if the target Cxn is observed with verbs belonging to similar semantic classes or subclasses, which increases Cxn semantic density. We could therefore assume that coercion effects in Italian elicit a partial categorization. The effect of semantic density, however, only explains part of the data. In fact, visual inspection of the relation between semantic density and the estimates of table 3 reveals that this effect does not explain the high coercibility of IM, or the low values of CO Cxns (see Figure 5). Figure 5: relation semantic density- estimates All things considered, semantic properties (modelled with distributional vectors) of Cxns (e.g., its density) are only one of the factors inﬂuencing speakers processing and recognition of coercion effects. In fact, it has been argued that Romance languages are more valency driven than English (and Germanic languages in general) (Perek and Hilpert, 2014). The results of both experiments provide substantial evidence for an integrated account of Italian coercion effects, which should consider not only the properties of the general abstract Cxn, but rather the interaction of the mismatching verb with Cxn meaning. These result also have interesting implications to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying Cxn ﬂexibility and productivity. In fact, these ﬁndings support the idea that Cxn meaning is abstracted from the semantics of prototypically occurring verbs. As we saw, several studies have argued in favour of this hypothesis for English, but the fact that we were able to adapt it to Italian suggests that the factors driving the acquisition of Cxns are - at least partially - not language-speciﬁc but rather general cognitive processes.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The paper illustrates the design and development of a textual corpus representative of the historical variants of Italian during the Great War, which was enriched with linguistic (lemmatization and pos-tagging) and meta-linguistic annotation. The corpus, after a manual revision of the linguistic annotation, was used for specializing existing NLP tools to process historical texts with promising results.","Introduction Introduction World War I (WWI) represents a crucial period in the history of Italian. In fact, De Mauro (1963) claimed that Italian as a national language was born in the trenches of the Great War. Since masses of men from different regions of the peninsula were forced to live together for months in the trenches and behind the lines, and were forced to use Italian as the main communicative medium instead of regional dialects, WWI produced a decisive step forward in the process leading to the linguistic uniﬁcation of Italy. The project Voci della Grande Guerra (VGG)1 provides scholars with a new text corpus to investigate the structure and different varieties of Italian 1http://www.vocidellagrandeguerra.it/ at the time of the Great War. The corpus includes a selection of texts representative of different textual genres and registers, including popular Italian. All texts have been automatically annotated with state-of-the-art NLP tools. A large subset of the corpus has then been manually corrected and enriched with metadata to classify a broad range of phenomena relevant for the study of the linguistic features of early XX century Italian. These characteristics make the VGG corpus unique in the very limited panorama of existing Italian historical corpora, among which it is worth pointing out the corpus dell’Opera del Vocabolario Italiano (OVI), the DiaCORIS corpus (Onelli et al., 2006), the MIDIA corpus (Gaeta et al., 2013), and the Letteratura italiana Zanichelli (LIZ). Moreover, the developed VGG corpus was used in an interesting case-study for the application and adaptation of NLP tools to process historical texts. The aim of this paper is to present the results of the annotation and linguistic analysis of the VGG corpus.","Conclusions and current developments Conclusions and current developments Voices of the Great War is the ﬁrst large corpus of documents in Italian dating back to the period of WWI. This corpus differs from other existing resources because it gives account of the wide range of varieties in which Italian was articulated in the years of WWI, namely from a diastratic (educated vs. uneducated writers), diaphasic (low/informal vs. high/formal registers) and diatopic (regional varieties, dialects) points of view. The linguistic variety subsumed in the corpus posits a number of challenges for current NLP tools, which are trained on texts representative of standard contemporary Italian. In this paper, we showed how we faced such challenges, by developing a more efﬁcient model for the analysis of Italian texts of the period of WWI. For approximately 20,000 tokens of the manually revised part of the corpus, we are building a syntactic annotation level performed according to the Universal Dependency scheme, which will constitute the ﬁrst small treebank for historical Italian. At the end of the project, the texts not covered by copyright will be freely dowloadable together with their annotations. The other texts will instead be browsable online with a dedicated interface.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We propose a new method for unsupervised learning of embeddings for lexical relations in word pairs. The model is trained on predicting the contexts in which a word pair appears together in corpora, then generalized to account for new and unseen word pairs. This allows us to overcome the data sparsity issues inherent in existing relation embedding learning setups without the need to go back to the corpora to collect additional data for new pairs.","In this paper we address the problem of unsupervised learning of lexical relations between any two words. We take the approach of unsupervised representation learning from distribution in corpora, as familiar from word embedding methods, and enhance it with an additional technique to overcome data sparsity. Word embedding models give a promise of learning word meaning from easily available text data in an unsupervised fashion and indeed the resulting vectors contain a lot of information about the semantic properties of words and objects they refer to, cf. for instance Herbelot and Vecchi (2015). Based on the distributional hypothesis coined by Z. S. Harris (1954), word embedding models, which construct word meaning representations as numeric vectors based on the cooccurrence statistics on the word’s context, have been gaining ground due to their quality and simplicity. Produced by efﬁcient and robust implementations such as word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), modern word vector models are able to predict whether two words are related in meaning, reaching human performance on benchmarks like WordSim353 (Agirre et al., 2009) and MEN (Bruni et al., 2014). On the other hand, lexical knowledge includes not only properties of individual words but also relations between words. To some extent, lexical semantic relations can be recovered from the word representations via the vector offset method as evidenced by various applications including analogy solving, but already on this task it has multiple drawbacks (Linzen, 2016) and has a better unsupervised alternative (Levy and Goldberg, 2014). Just like a word representation is inferred from the contexts in which the word occurs, information about the relation in a given word pair can be extracted from the statistics of contexts in which the two words of the pair appear together. In our model, we use this principle to learn high-quality pair embeddings from frequent noun pairs, and on their basis, build a way to construct a relation representation for an arbitrary pair. Note that we approach the problem from the viewpoint of lerning general-purpose semantic knowledge. Our goal is to provide a vector representation for an arbitrary pair of words w1, w2. This is a more general task than relation extraction, which aims at identifying the semantic relation between the two words in a particular context. Modeling such general relational knowledge is crucial for natural language understanding in realistic settings. It may be especially useful for recovering the notoriously difﬁcult bridging relations in discourse since they involve understanding implicit links between words in the text. Representations of word relations have applications in many NLP tasks. For example, they could be extremely useful for resolving bridging, especially of the lexical type (R¨osiger et al., 2018). But in order to be useful in practice, word relation models must generalize to rare or unseen cases.","The proposed model is simple in design and training, learning word relation vectors based on cooccurrence with unigram contexts and extending to rare or unseen words via a non-linear mapping. Despite its simplicity, the model is capable of capturing lexical relation patterns in vector representations. Most importantly, RelWord extends straightforwardly to novel word pairs in a manner that does not require recomputing cooccurrence counts from the corpus as in related approaches (Jameel et al., 2018). This allows for an easy integration of the pretrained model into various downstream applications. In our evaluation, we observed that learning word pair relation embeddings improves on the semantic information already present in word embeddings. With respect to certain semantic relations like synonyms, the performance of relation embedding is comparable to that of word embeddings but with an additional cost of training a representation for a signiﬁcant number of pair of words. For other relation types like antonyms or hypernyms, in which words differ semantically but share similar contexts, learned word pair relation embeddings have an edge over those derived from word embeddings via simple subtraction. While in practice one has to make a choice based on the task requirements, it is generally beneﬁcial to combine both types of relation embeddings for best results in a model like RelWord. Our current model employs pretrained word embeddings and learns the word pair embeddings and a word-to-relation embedding mapping separately. In the future, we plan to train a version of the model end-to-end, with word embeddings and the mapping trained simultaneously. As literature suggests (Hashimoto et al., 2015; Takase et al., 2016), such joint training might not only beneﬁt the model but also improve the performance of the resulting word embeddings on other tasks.",22,Distributional Semantics

We introduce the ﬁrst on-line approach to automatic post-editing (APE), i.e. the task of automatically correcting MT errors. We present experimental results of APE on English-Italian MT by simulating human post-edits with human reference translations, and by applying online APE on MT outputs of increasing quality. By evaluating APE on generic vs. specialised and static vs. adaptive neural MT, we address the question: At what cost on the MT side will APE become useless?","Automatic Post-editing for MT is a supervised learning task aimed to correct errors in a machinetranslated text (Knight and Chander, 1994; Simard et al., 2007). Cast as a problem of “monolingual translation” (from raw MT output into improved text in the same target language), APE has followed a similar evolution to that of MT. As in MT, APE research received a strong boost from shared evaluation exercises like those organized within the well-established WMT Conference on Machine Translation (Chatterjee et al., 2018). In terms of approaches, early MT-like phrase-based solutions (B´echara et al., 2011; Rosa et al., 2013; Lagarda et al., 2015; Chatterjee et al., 2015) have been recently outperformed and replaced by neural architectures that now represent the state of the art (Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2016; Chatterjee et al., 2017a; Tebbifakhr et al., 2018; Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2018). From the industry standpoint, APE has started to attract MT market players interested in combining the two technologies to support human translation in professional workﬂows (Crego et al., 2016). Focusing on this industry-oriented perspective, this paper makes a step further on APE research by exploring an online neural approach to the task. The goal is to leverage human feedback (post edits) to improve on-the-ﬂy a neural APE model without the need of stopping it for ﬁnetuning or re-training from scratch. Online learning capabilities are crucial (both for APE and MT) in computer-assisted translation scenarios where professional translators operate on suggestions provided by machines. In such scenarios, human corrections represent an invaluable source of knowledge that systems should exploit to enhance users’ experience and increase their productivity. Towards these objectives we provide two contributions. One is the ﬁrst online approach to neural APE. Indeed, while MT-like online learning techniques have been proposed for phrase-based APE (Ortiz-Mart´ınez and Casacuberta, 2014; Simard and Foster, 2013; Chatterjee et al., 2017b), nothing has been done yet under the state-of-the-art neural paradigm. In doing this, the other contribution is the ﬁrst evaluation of neural APE run on the output of neural MT (NMT). So far, published results report signiﬁcant gains1 when APE is run to correct the output of a phrase-based MT system. To our knowledge, the true potential of APE with higher quality NMT output has not been investigated yet. The last observation introduces a more general discussion on the relation between MT and APE. Since, by deﬁnition, APE’s reason of being is the sub-optimal quality of MT output, one might wonder if the level of current MT technology still justiﬁes efforts on APE. Along this direction, our third contribution is an analysis of online neural APE applied to the output of NMT systems featuring different levels of performance. Our competitors range from a generic model trained on large parallel data (mimicking the typical scenario in which industry users – e.g. Language Service Providers – rely on web-based services or other black-box systems) to highly customized online models (like those that LSPs would desire but typically cannot afford). Our experiments in this range of conditions aim to shed light on the future of APE from the industry standpoint by answering the question: At what cost on the MT side will APE become useless?","We introduced an online neural APE system, which is trained on generic data and only exploits user feedback to improve its performance, and evaluated it on the output of NMT systems featuring increasing complexity and in-domain data demand. Our results show the effectiveness of current APE technology in the typical setting of 4Statistical signiﬁcance is computed with paired bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004).",10,Machine Translation

In this paper we present PRET, a gold dataset annotated for prerequisite relations between educational concepts extracted from a computer science textbook, and we describe the language and domain independent approach for the creation of the resource. Additionally, we have created an annotation tool to support, validate and analyze the annotation.","Educational Concept Maps (ECM) are acyclic graphs which formally represent a domain’s knowledge and make explicit the pedagogical dependency relations between concepts (Adorni and Koceva, 2016). A concept, in an ECM, is an atomic piece of knowledge of the subject domain. From a pedagogical point of view, the most important dependency relation between concepts is the prerequisite relation, that explicits which concepts a student has to learn before moving to the next. Several approaches have been proposed to extract prerequisite relations from various educational sources (Vuong et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015; Gordon et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2018; Adorni et al., 2018). Textbooks in particular are a valuable resource for this task since they are designed to support the learning process respecting the prerequisite relation. In the literature, the evaluation of the extracted prerequisite relations is usually performed through comparison with a gold standard produced by human subjects that annotate relations between concepts (see, among the others, (Talukdar and Cohen, 2012; Liang et al., 2015; Fabbri et al., 2018)). However, most of the evaluations lack a systematic approach or simply lack the details that allow them to be repeated. In this paper, we present our experience in building PRET (Prerequisite-Enriched Terminology), a gold dataset annotated with the prerequisite relation between pairs of concepts. The issues emerged with PRET led us to deﬁne a methodology and a tool for manual prerequisite annotation. The goal of the tool is to support the creation of gold datasets for validating automatic extraction of prerequisites. Both the PRET dataset and the tool are available online1. PRET was constructed in two main steps: ﬁrst we exploited computational linguistics methods to extract relevant terms from a textbook2, then we asked humans to manually identify and annotate the prerequisite relations between educational concepts. Since the terminology creation step was extensively described in Adorni et al. (2018), this paper mainly focuses on the annotation phase. The annotation task consists in making explicit the prerequisite relations between two distinct concepts if the relation is somehow inferable from the text in question. We represent a concept as a domain–speciﬁc term denoting domain entities expressed by either single nominal terms (e.g. internet, network, software) or complex nominal structures with modiﬁers (e.g. malicious software, trojan horse, HyperText Document). Figure 1 shows 1http://teldh.dibris.unige.it/pret 2For the annotation we used chapter 4 of the computer science textbook “Computer Science: An Overview” (Brookshear and Brylow, 2015).","In this paper, we described PRET, a gold dataset manually annotated for prerequisite relations between pairs of concepts; moreover we presented the methodology we adopted and a tool to support prerequisite annotation. The case study, even limited as for the number of annotators and the educational material, was a reasonably good training ground to set the basis to deﬁne a methodology for prerequisite annotation and to identify the major issues related to this task. Moreover, the analysis of the annotation provided insights for automatic identiﬁcation of concepts and prerequisites, that will be investigated in future work.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The task is commonly performed manually by lexicographers verifying the contexts in which the VNeo appear. Developing such a task is likely to be of use from a cognitive, social and linguistic perspective. In the following, we first outline the motivation for our study and our goal, then focus on the construction of the dataset and the definition of the task.","Studying neologisms can tell us several things. From a lexicographic point of view, neologisms can show trends that a language is following. In our opinion, they can also shed light on various aspects related to linguistic creativity; when speakers use new words (coined by themselves, or recently coined by someone else), they expect that the hearer can understand what they have just said.1 Reversing the perspective, from the point of view of the hearers, when they encounter a word for the first time, they are generally capable of making hypotheses about the meaning of that word. The process of understanding unknown words involves the employment of previously acquired information. This knowledge can come from various sources: experience of the world, education, and contextual elements;2 in this contribution we focus on linguistic contextual (namely cooccurrence) information. For computational linguistics, neologisms raise some intriguing issues: automatic detection (especially for languages which do not separate written words with blank spaces); lemmatisation; POS tagging; semantic analysis; and so forth. In this paper we present the task we have developed in order to interpret neologisms, using a context-sensitive DSM described by McGregor et al. (McGregor et al., 2015). This model was built to represent concepts in a spatial configuration, making use of a computational technique that creates conceptual subspaces. With the help of this DSM we intend to analyse the behaviour of a sub-group of neologisms, namely verbal neologisms (see Amore 2017 for more background). Our goal is primarily linguistic. We intend to investigate the interpretation of VNeo, measuring the semantic salience of candidate synonyms by way of geometries indicated by an analysis of cooccurrence observations of VNeos. For instance, we expect that the VNeo googlare ‘to google’ and a verb like cercare ‘to search’ are geometrically related in a subspace specific to the conceptual context of the neologism.","The aim of the task presented here is to investigate the importance of linguistic context for the interpretation of neologisms, grounding the analysis in a context-sensitive DSM. With this task we intend to tackle issues connected with creativity processes and the environmental (contextual) sensibility typical of human cognition. In addition, we apply, for the first time, this DSM to Italian, providing a new semantic resource for the analysis of the language. Further studies may compare our results with other DSMs, and/or study what the semantic relations found with this specific approach reveal about other phenomena belonging to different linguistic levels (e.g. syntax).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

This paper intends to investigate the linguistic proﬁle of maleand femaleauthored texts belonging to two very different textual genres: newspaper articles and diary prose. By using a wide set of linguistic features automatically extracted from text and spanning across different levels of linguistic description, from lexicon to syntax, our analysis highlights the peculiarities of the two examined genres and how the genre dimension is inﬂuenced by variation depending on author’s gender (and vice versa).","Authorship proﬁling is the task of identifying the author of a given text by deﬁning an appropriate characterization of documents that captures the writing style of authors. It is a well-studied area with applications in various ﬁelds, such as intelligence and security, forensics, marketing etc. Over the last years, progress in different disciplines such as Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) stimulates new research directions in this ﬁeld leading to the development of ‘computational sociolinguistics’, a multidisciplinary ﬁeld whose goal is to study the relationship between language and social groups using computational methods (Nguyen et al., 2016). With this respect, a particular attention has been paid to the inﬂuence of gender as a demographic variable on language use. This is a topic that has attracted linguistic research for decades (see e.g. (Lakoff, 1973)) and has received a renewed interest in recent years in the NLP community. The investigation of possible differences between men’s and women’s linguistic styles has been carried out by using multivariate analyses taking into account gender-preferential stylistic features (Herring and Paolillo, 2006) and machine learning techniques inferring language models that differ at the level of linguistic patterns learned (e.g. based on n-grams of characters, on lexicon, etc.) (Argamon et al., 2003; Sarawgi et al., 2016). These studies have also moved the interest towards the analysis of possible effects driven by textual genres and topics on gender-speciﬁc language preferences. With this respect, in the context of the annual PAN evaluation campaign organized since 20131, a crossgenre gender identiﬁcation shared task was newly introduced (Rangel et al., 2016) in 2016, where participants were asked to predict author’s gender with respect to a textual typology different from the one used in training. This scenario turned out to be much more challenging for state-of-the art systems, suggesting that females and males can possibly use a different writing style according to genre. While the cross-genre gender prediction task has received attention for many languages, e.g. English, Portuguese, Arabic, the Italian language will be addressed for the ﬁrst time by the GxG (Gender X-Genre) shared task in the context of the 2018 EVALITA campaign2. In line with this interest in the international community, this paper presents a study on gender variation in writing styles with the aim of investigating if there are gender-speciﬁc characteristics that are constant across different genres. We deﬁne a methodology to carry out an in-depth linguistic analysis to detect differences and similarities in female- and male-authored writings belonging to two different genres. Similarly to the early work by Argamon et al. (2003) for English, our focus is on the linguistic phenomena that contribute to model men’s and women’s writings in a cross-genre perspective. The main novelty of this work is that we rely on a very wide set of linguistic features automatically extracted from text and capturing lexical, morpho-syntactic and syntactic phenomena. We choose not to focus our analysis on computer-mediated communication texts, which are more typically used in this context, but on two traditional textual genres, i.e. newspaper articles and diary prose.","We have presented a cross-genre linguistic proﬁling investigation comparing male and female texts in Italian. We examined a large set of linguistic features, intercepting lexical and syntactic phenomena, which were extracted from two very different textual genres: newspaper articles and diary prose. As expected, the comparative analysis highlighted a number of differences between the two genres, due to the more subjective language characterizing diaries with respect to journalistic prose. Interestingly, we also highlighted that some linguistic features characterize gender dimension and, even more interestingly, we found statistically signiﬁcant variations also in an objective prose such as newspaper articles.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

Radicioni",Conceptual Abstractness: from Nouns to Verbs,ENG,4,0,0,Università di Torino,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Turin,"Investigating lexical access, repEnglish. Investigating lexical access, representation and processing involves dealing with conceptual abstractness: abstract concepts are known to be more quickly and easily delivered in human communications than abstract meanings (Binder et al., 2005). Although these aspects have long been left unexplored, they are relevant: abstract terms are widespread in ordinary language, as they contribute to the realisation of various sorts of ﬁgurative language (metaphors, metonymies, hyperboles, etc.). Abstractness is therefore an issue for computational linguistics, as well. In this paper we illustrate how to characterise verbs with abstractness information. We provide an experimental evaluation of the presented approach on the largest existing corpus annotated with abstraction scores: our results exhibit good correlation with human ratings, and point out some open issues that will be addressed in future work.","Surprisingly enough, most of frequently used words (70% of the top 500) seem to be associated to abstract concepts (Recchia and Jones, 2012). Coping with abstractness is thus central to the investigation of lexical access, representation, and processing and, consequently, to build systems dealing with natural language. Information on conceptual abstractness impacts on many diverse NLP areas, such as word sense disambiguation (WSD) (Kwong, 2008), the semantic processing of ﬁgurative uses of language (Turney et al., 2011; Neuman et al., 2013), automatic translation and simpliﬁcation (Zhu et al., 2010), the processing of social tagging information (Benz et al., 2011), and many others, as well. In the WSD task, abstractness has been investigated as a core feature in the ﬁne tuning of WSD algorithms (Kwong, 2007): in particular, experiments have been carried out showing that “words toward the concrete side tend to be better disambiguated that those lying in the mid range, which are in turn better disambiguated than those on the abstract end” (Kwong, 2008). A recent, inspiring, special issue hosted by the Topics in Cognitive Science journal on ‘Abstract Concepts: Structure, Processing, and Modeling’ provides various pointers to tackle abstractness, by posing it as a relevant issue for several disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, general AI and, of course, computational linguistics (Bolognesi and Steen, 2018). As pointed out by the Editors of the special issue, the investigation on abstract concepts is central in the multidisciplinary debate between grounded views of cognition versus modal (or symbolic) views of cognition. In short, cognition might be embodied and grounded in perception and action (Gibbs Jr, 2005): accessing concepts would amount to retrieving and instantiating perceptual and motoric experience. Typically, abstract concepts, that have no direct counterpart in terms of perceptual and motoric experience, are accounted for by such theories with difﬁculty. On the other side, modal approaches to concepts are mostly in the realm of distributional semantic models: in this view, the meaning of rose is “the product of statistical computations from associations between rose and concepts like ﬂower, red, thorny, and love” (Louwerse, 2011).1 While we do not enter this passionate debate, we start by considering that distributional models are of little help in investigating abstractness, with some notable exceptions, such as the interesting links between abstractness and emotional content drawn in (Lenci et al., 2018). In fact, whilst distributional models can be easily used to express similarity and analogy (Turney, 2006), since they are basically built on co-occurrence matrices, they are largely acknowledged to convey vague associations rather than deﬁning a semantically structured space (Lenci, 2018). As illustrated in the following, our approach is different from such mainstream approach, in that the conceptual descriptions used to compute abstractness and contained in the lexical resources COVER (Mensa et al., 2018c) and ABS-COVER (Mensa et al., 2018b)2 are aimed at putting together the lexicographic precision and richness of BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012) and the common-sense knowledge available in ConceptNet (Havasi et al., 2007). One preliminary issue is, of course, how to deﬁne abstractness, since no general consensus has been reached on what should be measured when considering abstractness or, conversely, concreteness (Iliev and Axelrod, 2017). The term ‘abstract’ has two main interpretations: i) what is not perceptually salient, and ii) what is less speciﬁc, and referred to the more general categories contained in the upper levels of a taxonomy/ontology. According to the second view, the concreteness or speciﬁcity —the opposite of abstractness— can be deﬁned as a function of the distance intervening between a concept and a parent of that concept in the top-level of a taxonomy or ontology (Changizi, 2008): the closer to the root, the more abstract. In this setting, existing taxonomies and ontology-like resources can be directly employed, such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) or BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). In this work we single out the ﬁrst aspect, and 1Modal or symbolic views of cognition should not be confused with the symbolic AI, based on high-level representations of problems, as outlined by the pioneering work by Newell and Simon (such as, e.g., in (Newell, 1980)), that was concerned with physical symbol systems 2https://ls.di.unito.it. focus on perceptually salient abstractness; we start from a recent work where we proposed an algorithm to compute abstractness (Mensa et al., 2018a) for concepts contained in COVER (Mensa et al., 2018c; Lieto et al., 2016),3 and we extend that approach in order to characterise also verbs, whose abstractness is presently computed by combining the abstractness of their (nominal) dependents. Different from most literature we treat abstractness as a feature of word meanings (senses), rather than a feature of word forms (terms).","In this paper we have introduced a method to compute verbs abstractness based on the ABSCOVER lexical resource. We reported on the experimentation, and discussed the obtained results, pointing out some issues such as the problem of the sense selection, and the difﬁculty in characterising more concrete concepts. As regards as future work, the simple averaging scheme on dependents’ abstractness scores can be reﬁned in many ways, e.g., by differentiating the contribution of different sorts of dependents, or based on their distribution. Yet, the set of relations that constitute the backbone of ABSCOVER can be further exploited both for computing the abstractness of dependents, and, in the long term, for generating explanations about the obtained abstractness scores, in virtue of the set of relations at the base of the explanatory power of COVER (Colla et al., 2018). Finally, we plan to explore whether and to what extent our lexical resource can be combined with distributional models, in order to pair those strong associative features with the more semantically structured space described by ABS-COVER.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Deep Neural Networks achieve state-of-the-art performances in several semantic NLP tasks but lack of explanation capabilities as for the limited interpretability of the underlying acquired models. In other words, tracing back causal connections between the linguistic properties of an input instance and the produced classiﬁcation is not possible. In this paper, we propose to apply Layerwise Relevance Propagation over linguistically motivated neural architectures, namely Kernel-based Deep Architectures (KDA), to guide argumentations and explanation inferences. In this way, decisions provided by a KDA can be linked to the semantics of input examples, used to linguistically motivate the network output.","Deep Neural Networks are usually criticized as they are not epistemologically transparent devices, i.e. their models cannot be used to provide explanations of the resulting inferences. An example can be neural question classiﬁcation (QC) (e.g. (Croce et al., 2017)). In QC the correct category of a question is detected to optimize the later stages of a question answering system, (Li and Roth, 2006). An epistemologically transparent learning system should trace back the causal connections between the proposed question category and the linguistic properties of the input question. For example, the system could motivate the decision: ”What is the capital of Zimbabwe?” refers to a Location, with a sentence such as: Since it is similar to ”What is the capital of California?” which also refers to a Location. Unfortunately, neural models, as for example Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), or even Attention-based Networks (Larochelle and Hinton, 2010), correspond to parameters that have no clear conceptual counterpart: it is thus difﬁcult to trace back the network components (e.g. neurons or layers in the resulting topology) responsible for the answer. In image classiﬁcation, Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP) (Bach et al., 2015) has been used to decompose backward across the MLP layers the evidence about the contribution of individual input fragments (i.e. pixels of the input images) to the ﬁnal decision. Evaluation against the MNIST and ILSVRC benchmarks suggests that LRP activates associations between input and output fragments, thus tracing back meaningful causal connections. In this paper, we propose the use of a similar mechanism over a linguistically motivated network architecture, the Kernel-based Deep Architecture (KDA), (Croce et al., 2017). Tree Kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2001) are here used to integrate syntactic/semantic information within a MLP network. We will show how KDA input nodes correspond to linguistic instances and by applying the LRP method we are able to trace back causal associations between the semantic classiﬁcation and such instances. Evaluation of the LRP algorithm is based on the idea that explanations improve the user expectations about the correctness of an answer and shows its applicability in human computer interfaces. In the rest of the paper, Section 2 describes the KDA neural approach while section 3 illustrates how LRP connects to KDAs. In section 4 early results of the evaluation are reported.","This paper describes an LRP application to a KDA that makes use of analogies as explanations of a neural network decision. A methodology to measure the explanation quality has been also proposed and the experimental evidence conﬁrms the effectiveness of the method in increasing the trust of a user upon automatic classiﬁcations. Future work will focus on the selection of subtrees as meaningful evidences for the explanation, or on the modeling of negative information for disambiguation as well as on more in depth investigation of the landmark selection policies. Moreover, improved experimental scenarios involving users and dialogues will be also designed, e.g. involving further investigation within Semantic Role Labeling, using the method proposed in (Croce et al., 2012).",1,Language Models

An NLP-based Approach for Concept Prerequisite Learning,ENG,7,3,1,"Università di Genova, Università di Pisa, CNR-ILC",3,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,"Genova, Pisa","This paper presents a method for prerequisite learning classification between educational concepts. The proposed system was developed by adapting a classification algorithm designed for sequencing Learning Objects to the task of ordering concepts from a computer science textbook. In order to apply the system to the new task, for each concept we automatically created a learning unit from the textbook using two criteria based on concept occurrences and burst intervals. Results are promising and suggest that further improvements could highly benefit the results.","Personalised learning paths creation is an active research topic in the field of education (Chen, 2009; Kurilovas et al., 2015; Almasri et al., 2019). The most fundamental issue behind this task is the need to understand how educational concepts are pedagogically related to each other: what information one has to study/know first in order to understand a given topic. In this paper, we focus on such relations, i.e. prerequisite relations, between educational concepts of a textbook in English and we present a method for their automatic identification. Here, we define concepts as all the relevant topics extracted from the textbook and represent them as single or multi-word terms. Automatic prerequisite extraction is a task deeply rooted in the field of education, whose results can be easily integrated in many different contexts, such as curriculum planning (Agrawal et al., 2016), course sequencing (Vuong et al., 2011), reading list generation (Gordon et al., 2017), automatic assessment (Wang and Liu, 2016), domain ontology construction (Zouaq et al., 2007; Larranaga et al., 2014), and automatic educational content creation (Lu et al., 2019). Several methods have been devised to extract prerequisite relations (Liang et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2017a; Liang et al., 2018b), however, they were mainly focused on educational materials already enriched with some sort of explicit relations, such as Wikipedia pages, course materials, or learning objects (LOs). More challenging is identifying prerequisites when no such relations are given and textual content is the only available resource. In 2019, we proposed two methods to identify prerequisite relations between concepts without using external knowledge or even pre-defined relations. The former method (Adorni et al., 2019) is based on burst analysis and temporal reasoning on concepts' occurrence, while the latter (Miaschi et al., 2019) uses deep learning for learning object ordering. Both these methods extract prerequisite relations from textual educational materials without using any form of structured information. In this work, we adapt the system for learning object ordering described in Miaschi et al. (2019) to the task of sequencing concepts in a textbook according to their prerequisite relations. For training and testing our system, we relied on a new version of PRET (Alzetta et al., 2018), a gold dataset manually annotated with prerequisite relations between educational concepts. Moreover, since the classifier was designed to acquire learning objects as input, we automatically created a learning unit for each concept according to two different criteria: (i) considering all sentences showing an occurrence of the concept, (ii) considering burst intervals (Kleinberg, 2003) of each concept extracted according to the strategy of Adorni et al. (2019). The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. First, we present related work (Section 2) and the dataset used for the experiments (Section 3). Section 4.1 presents the classifier, while burst analysis is described in Section 4.2 and the experimental settings in Section 4.3. Results and discussion are reported in Section 4.4, while error analysis is illustrated in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper. Our Contribution. In this paper: (i) we use a deep learning-based approach for prerequisite relation extraction between educational concepts of a textbook; (ii) we test the impact of creating learning units for each concept according to different criteria and without relying on any explicit structured information, such as Wikipedia hyperlinks; (iii) we show the effectiveness of our approach on real educational materials.","In this paper we tested a deep learning model for prerequisite relation extraction in a real educational environment, using a dataset (PRET 2.0) built starting from a computer science textbook. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our system, suggesting that it is possible to infer prerequisite relation out of textual educational material without using any form of structured information. Nevertheless, further work needs to be done, particularly for improving the performances of our system in an out-of-domain scenario, namely using concept pairs of a different domain during testing. Moreover, it could be useful to investigate the use of transitive relations and to study more accurately their impact on the system's performance. In addition, in order to identify prerequisite relationships while taking into account different types of relations (e.g. transitive ones) it could be interesting to frame our task as a ranking or multi-classification task rather than a binary classification one. Further analysis is also required to investigate the effect of using different numbers of sentences for creating WE. We plan also to explore the impact of using temporal reasoning on concept pairs (Adorni et al., 2019), which has not been considered in this work.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We apply linguistic features used in previous supervised machine learning research and additionally exploit structural and typographic characteristics of simplified texts. The results show a difference in complexity among the texts investigated, with optimal partitioning solutions ranging between two and four clusters. They demonstrate that both linguistic and structural/typographic features are constitutive of the clusters.","Simplified language aims to provide comprehensible information to people with reduced reading abilities. This group includes individuals with cognitive impairments, learning disabilities, prelingually deaf people, functionally illiterate individuals, and foreign language learners (Bredel and Maaß, 2016). Simplified language is characterized by reduced lexical and syntactic complexity and includes images, structured layouts, and explanations of difficult words. In German, several guidelines define which structures should be avoided, which need to be paraphrased, and which are understandable (Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales, 2011; Inclusion Europe, 2009; Maaß, 2015; Netzwerk Leichte Sprache, 2013). Various countries have recognized simplified language as a means of inclusion, enabling the target populations to access information about their legal rights and participate in society. German-speaking countries have promoted simplified language more recently, particularly after the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (United Nations, 2006) in Austria (2008), Germany (2009), and Switzerland (2014). As a result, large amounts of simplified German texts have become available. More recently, simplified German has been conceptualized as a construct with multiple complexity levels (Bock, 2014; Bredel and Maaß, 2016; Kellermann, 2014). However, these proposals are still theoretical, as no sets of guidelines exist that define these levels with respect to linguistic or other features. The social franchise network Capito, a provider of simplification services and training courses for simplified language translators, recognizes three levels of simplified German corresponding to the Common European Framework of Reference for Language (CEFR) levels A1, A2, and B1. However, being commercially oriented, Capito does not make its CEFR adaptation publicly available. In this paper, we present an unsupervised machine learning (clustering) approach to analyze texts in simplified German with the goal of investigating evidence of multiple complexity levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind. We apply linguistic features used in previous supervised machine learning research (classification) and also exploit structural and typographic characteristics of simplified texts, which have been described in the literature but not incorporated into clustering or classification approaches in the context of simplified language. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the research background. Section 3 describes our approach, introducing a novel dataset (Section 3.1), the feature design and engineering (Section 3.2), the clustering experiments (Section 3.3), and a discussion thereof (Section 3.4). Section 4 offers a conclusion and an outlook on future research questions.","In this paper, we have presented the first approach to investigating simplified German texts by means of unsupervised machine learning techniques as a basis for future readability assessment studies on this language variety. In addition, we have introduced novel features that have been described in the literature but not incorporated into machine learning (clustering and/or classification) approaches in the context of simplified language, notably: number of images, number of paragraphs, number of lines, number of words of a specific font type, and adherence to a one-sentence-per-line rule. Our findings provide evidence that existing texts are not simplified at a unique complexity level of German. We have demonstrated that features based on structural information are capable of accounting for the different complexity levels found. As a next step, we will use the results of the experiments presented in this paper to establish a framework of inductively generated complexity levels. This framework will serve as the basis for readability assessment in the context of simplified German. Knowledge derived from our study can also inform automatic and manual approaches to the simplification of German.",11,Text Simplification

Often, these tasks are approached with supervised learning methods, which need considerable labeled datasets. This paper presents the first Italian dataset for SLU in a voice assistant scenario. It is the product of a semi-automatic procedure and is used as a benchmark for various open-source and commercial systems.","Conversational interfaces, such as Google’s Home or Amazon’s Alexa, are becoming pervasive in daily life. As an important part of any conversation, language understanding aims at extracting the meaning a partner is trying to convey. Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a fundamental role in such a scenario. Generally speaking, in SLU, a spoken utterance is first transcribed, and then semantic information is extracted. Language understanding, i.e., extracting a semantic 'frame' from a transcribed user utterance, typically involves: i) Intent Detection (ID) and ii) Slot Filling (SF) (Tur et al., 2010). The former classifies a user utterance into an intent, i.e., the purpose of the user, while the latter identifies the 'arguments' of such intent. As an example, let us consider Figure 1, where the user asks for playing a song (Intent=PlayMusic) (with or without you, Slot=song) of an artist (U2, Slot=artist). Usually, supervised learning methods are adopted for SLU. Their efficacy strongly depends on the availability of labeled data. There are various approaches to the production of labeled data, depending on the intricacy of the problem, the characteristics of the data, and the available resources (e.g., annotators, time, and budget). When the reuse of existing public data is not feasible, manual labeling should be accomplished, eventually by automating part of the labeling process. In this work, we present the first public dataset for the Italian language for SLU. It is generated by a semi-automatic procedure from an existing English dataset annotated with intents and slots. We have translated the sentences into Italian and reported the annotations based on a token span algorithm. Then, the translation, spans, and consistency of the entities in Italian have been manually validated. Finally, the dataset is used as a benchmark for NLU systems. In particular, we will compare a recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach (Castellucci et al., 2019) with Rasa (ras, 2019), taken from the open-source world, IBM Watson Assistant (wat, 2019), Google DialogFlow (dia, 2019), and, finally, Microsoft LUIS (msl, 2019), some commercial solutions in use. Following, in Section 2, related works will be discussed; in Section 3, the dataset generation process will be explained; in Section 4, we will present the experiments. Finally, in Section 5, we will draw the conclusions.""","The contributions of this work are two-fold: first, we presented and released the first Italian SLU dataset (Almawave-SLU) in the context of voice assistants. It is composed of 7,142 sentences annotated with respect to intents and slots, almost equally distributed across 7 different intents. The effort spent on the construction of this new resource, according to the semi-automatic procedure described, is about 24 FTE (Full-Time Equivalent), with an average production of about 300 examples per day. We consider this effort to be lower than typical efforts required to create linguistic resources from scratch. Second, we compared some of the most popular NLU services with this data. The results show that they all have similar features and performances. However, when compared to another specific architecture for SLU, namely Bert-Joint, they perform worse. This was expected and demonstrates that Almawave-SLU can be a valuable dataset for training and testing SLU systems in the Italian language. In the future, we hope to continuously improve and extend the dataset.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

As indicated by Schreibman (2011), jTEI was born in 2011 after three years of gestation with the intention of publishing selected papers of annual conferences (volumes 1-2, 4, 6, 8-10) and monothematic issues on topics of relevance to the TEI community (volume 3 dedicated to linguistics and volume 5 dedicated to infrastructure). Schreibman (2014) also states that Volume 7, the first fruit of an open call, touches ""contemporary meta concerns within the community"" . A piece of the Digital Humanities sector is detected in this study through the diacronic analysis of terms extracted from the articles published in jTEI from 2011 to 2019. The aim is to identify mono- and polyrematic terms typical of the domain, a spy of the thematic orientation of the research activities of the TEI community. Today the study of communities is becoming central in order to understand and interpret for the various domains the scientific direction as well as the genre, the stakeholders and the possible connections between communities. Just to give an example, from reading the indices of the extraction of jTEI Corpus, the scientific community that revolves around TEI seems not to want to use the noun computer and the adjective computational, preferring instead to use the adjective digital combined with a myriad of nouns (such as for example. editions, humanities, text, resources, age, archive, objects, specimen, library, tools) in line with the uses of the wider Digital Humanities community, but not Computational Linguistics.","Recovering a sample of the trend of research activities of a particular scientific sector, such as those of Digital Humanities through jTEI, can be stimulating to understand the areas investigated by the various authors over a period of ten years. In particular, the willingness to capture open access articles today creates opportunities for the analysis of scientific communities that in the past was not conceivable. The work carried out represents an initial experience of information recovery and analysis to study the trend of the scientific community of Digital Humanities through a magazine dedicated to it, the jTEI. We also think that it is essential to expand our sources with other types of reference: such as blogs, forums, national and international conference acts and magazines. In the analysis, a look will also be directed to authors to understand connections and extraneousness between computational linguistics and Digital Humanities.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We will describe the creation of the dataset discussing the problematic aspects found in the annotation process, such as the lack of coverage of FrameNet for the annotation of texts extracted from social media. Finally, we present a preliminary study that describes the relations between the frames and the cyberbullying-related annotation of the original dataset.","The semantic analysis of a text involves the classification of predicates into a set of events, for which it is important to determine who did what, when and where. For example, in the sentence “In 1912, the Titanic hit an iceberg on its first trip across the Atlantic”, the verb “hit” represents the event, “Titanic” is the main actor of that event, “1912” and “Atlantic” indicate when and where it took place, and so on. The process of extracting the semantic roles and relations in a sentence is called Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), and, in the last years, both resources listing possible events and corpora have been annotated with this kind of information. Examples of such datasets are FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005). Given the availability of these resources, over the years SRL has gained more attention and has become an important task in computational linguistics, with a growing number of works and evaluations (QasemiZadeh et al., 2019; Basili et al., 2012). Unfortunately, the vast majority of annotated datasets relies mainly on newswire and narrative texts, and their coverage turns out to be inadequate when it comes to annotate more specific domains, such as, for instance, football domain (Torrent et al., 2014) or medicine domain (Tan et al., 2011). Aside from that, over the last decades, ICT technologies and communication habits underwent profound changes, with the greatest part of text production in the world coming from social networks and being usually written in non-standard language. This kind of communication is of fundamental importance, in particular for teenagers’ social life. For instance, according to the last report by the Italian Statistical Institute (ISTAT, 2014) in Italy 82.6 of children aged 11-17 use the mobile phone every day. The use of these new technologies, however, leads also to some undesirable side effects, as the proliferation of hate speech and the digitization of traditional forms of harassment, also known as cyberbullying. Many studies (O’Moore and Kirkham, 2001; Fekkes et al., 2006; Farag et al., 2019) have highlighted that cyberbullying can have a negative impact on the victims’ psychological and emotional well-being and that, in extreme cases, it can lead to self-harm and suicidal thoughts. For this reason, some strategies have been implemented to detect and contrast this phenomenon (Van Hee et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2016; Menini et al., 2019), but none of them makes use of SRL, and no resources on this topic based on frame semantics have been developed yet. We therefore developed BullyFrame, a dataset annotated with frame semantic annotation, where the messages are taken from a corpus of data on cyberbullying interaction in Italian, gathered through a WhatsApp experimentation with lower secondary school students (Sprugnoli et al., 2018). Our work leads to the release of the annotated corpus (see Section 3), and constitutes a feasibility study, that investigates the potential lacks of FrameNet - resource that does not claim to be exhaustive in its coverage - for the annotation of online chats that, in addition to their non-standard nature, contain offensive language and informal expressions. We show, for instance, that some frames are completely missing, such as those regarding sexual orientation, as discussed in Section 4. In other cases, FrameNet provides frames whose purpose is similar to the needed one, but cannot fit perfectly the meaning of the sentence. For example, the frame “Offenses” refers to acts that violate a legal code, but it is not used for marking offenses (or bad words) between two users, e.g. “idiota” (“idiot” - currently tagged as Mental property), “stronzetta” (“asshole” - left currently with no annotation). Similarly, a sentence like “Ti ricordo che io ho ballato con Kledi” (“I remind you that I danced with Kledi”) cannot be correctly annotated, as neither Evoking, nor Reminder or Remembering * frames are able to capture the meaning of someone who reminds something to another person. In Section 5, we also provide a comparison study to highlight relations between the newly-released frame annotation and the existing one regarding the type of cyberbullying expression. Results show that some of them are strictly connected (even when it is not immediate to understand). Finally, in Section 6 we present Framy, a frame annotation tool that works as a web server and that has been used for annotating BullyFrame.","In this paper, we present and release BullyFrame, an Italian resource consisting of a set of WhatsApp chats with full-text FrameNet annotations. The data, freely accessible on GitHub, increases the availability of resources in Italian. We also discuss how FrameNet lacks certain frames, as it cannot cover some expressions used mainly in social media language. Finally, we describe Framy, a free tool that supports the manual annotation of texts with respect to FrameNet. In the future, we aim to extend this dataset by including other text resources and expanding FrameNet's coverage for the social media domain, addressing informal expressions and emojis.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

A Cross-Genre Analysis of Linguistic Phenomena within Text,ENG,4,2,1,"Università di Pisa, CNR-ILC",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"Moving from the assumption that formal, rather than content features, can be used to detect differences and similarities among textual genres and registers, this paper presents a new approach to the linguistic profiling methodology, which focuses on the internal parts of a text. A case study is presented showing that it is possible to model the degree of variance within texts representative of four traditional genres and two levels of complexity for each.","The combined use of corpus-based and computational linguistics methods to investigate language variation has become an established line of research. The heart of this research is the so-called ‘linguistic profiling’, a technique in which a large number of counts of linguistic features automatically extracted from parsed corpora are used as a text profile and can then be compared to average profiles for groups of texts (van Halteren, 2004). Although it was originally developed for authorship verification and recognition, linguistic profiling has been successfully applied to the study of genre and register variation, following Biber’s claim that 'linguistic features from all levels function together as underlying dimensions of variation, with each dimension defining a different set of linguistic relations among registers' (Biber, 1993). By modeling the ‘form’ of a text through large sets of linguistic features extracted from representative corpora, it has been possible not only to enhance automatic classification of genres (Stamatatos et al., 2001), but also to gain a better understanding of the impact of features in classifying genres and text varieties (Cimino et al., 2017). This paper moves in this framework but presents a new approach to linguistic profiling, in which the unit of analysis is not the document as a whole entity, but the internal parts in which it is articulated. In this respect, our perspective is similar to the one proposed by Crossley et al. (2011), who developed a supervised classification method based on linguistically motivated features to discriminate paragraphs with a specific rhetorical purpose within English students’ essays. However, differently from that work, we focus on Italian and enlarge the analysis to four traditional textual genres and two levels of language complexity for each. The aim is i) to explore to what extent the internal structure of a text can be modeled via linguistic features automatically extracted from texts, and ii) to study whether the variance across different parts of a text changes according to genre and level of complexity within genre.","In this paper we have presented a novel approach to the study of language variation, which relies on the prerequisites of the linguistic profiling methodology but with the specific purpose of modeling the stylistic form of the different parts within a text. A cross-genre investigation on four traditional genres in Italian, and two levels of complexity for each, showed that morpho-syntactic and syntactic features are differently distributed across subsections of texts belonging to a specific genre and language variety. This approach has important implications for research on genre variation since it suggests that the characterization of texts and texts varieties should benefit by inspecting corpora from this fine-grained perspective. A better understanding of linguistic phenomena characterizing the introductory, middle and conclusive parts of a text is also highly relevant not only to enhance automatic genre classification but also for other natural language processing applications devoted to modeling style: e.g. in education, as a component of intelligent tutoring systems able to provide detailed feedback to students in writing courses or for the automatic generation of texts with the stylistic properties of a specific genre and level of complexity.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics
310_2019,2019,11,"Nicolò Busetto, Rodolfo Delmonte",Annotating Shakespeare’s Sonnets with Appraisal Theory to Detect Irony,ENG,2,0,0,Università Ca' Foscari Venezia,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Venice,"In this paper, we propose an approach to irony detection based on Appraisal Theory (Martin and White, 2005) in Shakespeare’s Sonnets, a well-known dataset that is statistically valuable. In order to produce meaningful experiments, we created a gold standard by collecting opinions from famous literary critics on Shakespeare’s Sonnets, focusing on irony. We started by manually annotating the data using Appraisal Theory as a reference framework. This choice is motivated by the fact that Appraisal annotation schemes allow smooth evaluation of highly elaborated texts, such as political commentaries. The annotation is then automatically compiled and checked against the gold standard in order to verify the persistence of certain schemes that can be identified as ironic, satiric, or sarcastic. Upon observation, irony detection reaches a final match of 80%.","Shakespeare’s Sonnets are a collection of 154 poems renowned for being full of ironic content (Weiser, 1983; Weiser, 1987) and for their ambiguity, which often reverses the overall interpretation of the sonnet. Lexical ambiguity, i.e., a word with several meanings, emanates from the way in which the author uses words that can be interpreted in multiple ways, not only because they are inherently polysemous but also because sometimes the additional meaning they evoke can be derived based on their sound, i.e., homophones (see ""eye,"" ""I"" in sonnet 152). The sonnets are also full of metaphors, which often require contextualizing the content within the historical Elizabethan life and society. Furthermore, there is an abundance of words related to specific language domains in the sonnets. For instance, there are words related to the language of economy, war, nature, and the discoveries of the modern age, each of which can be used as a metaphor for love. Many of the sonnets are organized around a conceptual contrast, an opposition that runs parallel and then diverges, sometimes using the rhetorical figure of chiasmus. It is this contrast that generates irony, and sometimes satire, sarcasm, and even parody. Irony can be considered as what one means using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect, or as a state of affairs or an event that seems contrary to what one expects and is amusing as a result. Sarcasm, on the other hand, can be regarded as the use of irony to mock or convey contempt. Parody is achieved by using the words or thoughts of a person but adapting them to a ridiculously inappropriate subject. There are several types of irony, but in this study, we focus on verbal irony, which, in the strict sense, involves saying the opposite of what you mean, with the outcome depending on the extralinguistic context (Attardo, 1994). As a result, satire and irony are slightly overlapping but constitute two separate techniques, and sarcasm can be regarded as a specialization or a subset of irony. It is important to note that in many cases, these linguistic structures require the use of nonliteral or figurative language, such as metaphors. This consideration has been carefully taken into account when annotating the sonnets using the Appraisal Theory Framework (henceforth ATF). In our approach, we will follow the incongruity presumption, or incongruity-resolution presumption. Theories connected to the incongruity presumption are mostly cognitive-based and related to concepts discussed, for example, in Attardo (2000). The focus of theorization under this presumption is that in humorous texts, or broadly speaking in any humorous situation, there is an opposition between two alternative dimensions. As a result, we will look for contrast in our study of the sonnets, produced by the contents of manual classification. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how ATF can be useful for detecting irony, considering its ambiguity and elusive traits.","In this paper we have presented work carried out to annotate and experiment with the theme of irony in Shakespeare’s Sonnets. The gold standard for the experiment has been created by collecting comments produced by literary critics on the presence of some kind of thematic, semantic and syntactic opposition in the sonnets as to produce some sort of irony. At first the sonnets have been annotated using the framework of Appraisal Theory and then we checked the results: we obtained a very high level of matching with the critics’ opinions at 80%. Eventually, Appraisal framework has shown its ability to classify and diversify different levels of irony effectively.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We run two types of analysis: one top-down, based on a preselection of frequent words in both newspapers, and one bottom-up, using a combination of the observed shifts and relative and absolute frequency. The analysis is specific to this data, but the method can serve as a blueprint for similar studies.","Different newspapers, especially if positioned at opposite ends of the political spectrum, can render the same event in different ways. In Example (1), both headlines are about the leader of the Italian political movement “Cinque Stelle” splitting up with his girlfriend, but the Italian left-oriented newspaper *la Repubblica* (rep in the examples) and right-oriented *Il Giornale* (gio in the examples) describe the news quite differently. The news in Example (2), which is about a baby-sitter killing a child in Moscow, is also reported by the two newspapers mentioning and stressing different aspects of the same event. Often though, the same words are used, but with distinct nuances, or in combination with other, different words. In this work we discuss a method to study how the same words are used differently in two sources, exploiting vector shifts in embedding spaces. The two embeddings models built on data coming from *la Repubblica* and *Il Giornale* might contain interesting differences, but since they are separate spaces they are not directly comparable. Previous work has encountered this issue from a diachronic perspective: when studying meaning shift in time, embeddings built on data from different periods would encode different usages, but they need to be comparable. Instead of constructing separate spaces and then aligning them (Hamilton et al., 2016b), we adopt the method used by Kim et al. (2014) and subsequently by Del Tredici et al. (2016) for Italian, whereby embeddings are first trained on a corpus, and then updated with a new one; observing the shifts certain words undergo through the update is a rather successful method to proxy meaning change. Rather than across time, we update embeddings across sources which are identical in genre (newspapers) but different in political positioning. Specifically, we train embeddings on articles coming from the newspaper *La Repubblica* (leaning left) and update them using articles coming from the newspaper *Il Giornale* (leaning right). We take the observed shift of a given word (or the shift in distance between two words) as a proxy for a difference in usage of that term, running two types of analysis. One is top-down, and focuses on a set of specific words which are frequent in both corpora. The other one is bottom-up, focusing on words that result potentially interesting on the basis of measures that combine the observed shift with both relative and absolute frequency. As a byproduct, we also learn something about the interaction of shifts and frequency.","We experimented with using embedding shifts as a tool to study how words are used in two different Italian newspapers. We focused on a pre-selection of high-frequency words shared by the two newspapers, and on another set of words which were highlighted as potentially interesting through a newly proposed methodology that combines observed embedding shifts and relative and absolute frequency. Most differently used words in the two newspapers are proper nouns of politically active individuals as well as places, and concepts that are highly debated on the political scene. Beside the present showcase, we believe this methodology can be more generally used to highlight which words might deserve deeper, dedicated analysis when studying meaning change. One aspect that should be further investigated is the role played by the methodology used for aligning and/or updating the embeddings. As an alternative to what we proposed, one could employ different strategies to manipulate embedding spaces towards highlighting meaning changes. For example, Rodda et al. (2016) exploited Representational Similarity Analysis (Kriegeskorte and Kievit, 2013) to compare embeddings built on different spaces in the context of studying diachronic semantic shifts in ancient Greek. Another interesting approach, still in the context of diachronic meaning change, but applicable to our datasets, was introduced by Hamilton et al. (2016a), who use both a global and a local neighborhood measure of semantic change to disentangle shifts due to cultural changes from purely linguistic ones.",15,Fact Checking and Fake News Detection

The articles are obtained from two mainstream Italian newspapers. In order to assess the models’ performance, we set up a human-based evaluation where 30 different native speakers expressed their judgment over a variety of aspects. The outcome shows that: (i) pointer networks perform better than standard sequence-to-sequence models, creating mostly correct and appropriate titles; (ii) the suitability of a headline to its article for pointer networks is on par with or better than the gold headline; (iii) gold headlines are still by far more inviting than generated headlines to read the whole article, highlighting the contrast between human creativity and content appropriateness.","Progress in language generation has made it really hard to tell if a text is written by a human or is machine-generated. The recently developed GPT-2 transformer-based language model (Radford et al., 2019), when prompted with an arbitrary input, is able to generate synthetic texts which are impressively human-like. But what makes generated text good text? We investigate this question in the context of automatically generated news headlines. Headlines could be seen as very short summaries, so that one could use evaluation methods typical of summarisation (Gatt and Krahmer, 2018), but they are in fact a very special kind of summaries. In addition to being suitable in terms of content, newspaper titles must also be inviting towards reading the whole article. A model that, given an article, learns how to generate its title must then be able to cover both the summarisation as well as the luring aspect. We collect articles from Italian newspapers online, and generate their headlines automatically. In contrast to the feature-rich approach of Colmenares et al. (2015), which requires substantial linguistic preprocessing for feature extraction, we rely on recent developments in language modelling, and train three different sequence-to-sequence models that learn to generate a headline given (a portion of) its article. We compare these generated headlines to one another and to the gold headline through a series of human-based evaluations which take several aspects into account, ranging from grammatical correctness to attractiveness towards reading the full article. The factors we measure are in line with the requirements for human-based evaluation mentioned by Gatt and Krahmer (2018), and are useful since it is known that standard metrics based on lexical overlap are not accurate indicators for the goodness of generated text (Liu et al., 2016).","The quality of three different sequence-to-sequence models that generate headlines starting from an article was comparatively assessed through human judgement, which we contextually used to evaluate the original headlines as well. The best system is a pointer network model, with correctness judgements on par with the gold headlines. Evaluating the generated output on different levels, especially attractiveness, which typically characterises news headlines, uncovered an interesting aspect: gold headlines appear to be the most attractive to read the whole article, but are not considered the most suitable, on the contrary, they are judged as the most unsuitable of all. Therefore, when automatically generating headlines, just relying on content might never lead us to titles that are human-like and attractive enough for people to read the article. This should be considered in any future work on news headline generation. At the evaluation stage, it would also be beneficial to involve professional journalists. A first contact with one of the newspapers at the early stages of our evaluation experiments did not yet yield any concrete collaboration, but expert judgement on the quality of the generated headlines is something we would like to include in the future. One aspect that we have not explicitly considered in our experiments is that the headlines come from different newspapers (positioned at opposite ends of the political spectrum), and can carry newspaper-specific characteristics. Robust headline generation should consider this, too.",1,Language Models

Our results show that zero-shot models have satisfying, although not optimal, performances in both languages (average F1 higher than 60 for event detection vs. average F1 ranging between 40 and 50 for event classification). We also show that adding extra fine-tuning data of the evaluation language is not only beneficial but results in better models when compared to the corresponding non-zero-shot transfer ones, achieving highly competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art systems.","Recently pre-trained word representations encoded in Language Models (LM) have gained lot of popularity in Natural Language Processing (NLP) thanks to their ability to encode high-level syntactic-semantic language features and produce state-of-the-art results in various tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (Peters et al., 2018), Machine Translation (Johnson et al., 2017; Ramachandran et al., 2017), Text Classification (Eriguchi et al., 2018; Chronopoulou et al., 2019), among others. These models are pre-trained on large amounts of unannotated text and then fine-tuned using the induced LM structure to generalize over specific training data. Given their success in monolingual environments, especially for English, there has been a growing interest in the development of cross-lingual as well as multilingual representations (Vulić and Moens, 2015; Ammar et al., 2016; Conneau et al., 2018; Artetxe et al., 2018) to investigate different cross-lingual transfer learning scenarios, including zero-shot transfer, i.e. the direct application of a model fine-tuned using data in one language to a different test language. Following the approach in Pires et al. (2019), in this paper we investigate the generalisation abilities of Multilingual BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) on English (EN) and Italian (IT). Multilingual BERT is particularly well suited for this task because it easily allows the implementation of cross-lingual transfer learning, including zero-shot transfer. We use event detection as our downstream task, a highly complex semantic task with a well-established tradition in NLP (Ahn, 2006; Ji and Grishman, 2008; Ritter et al., 2012; Nguyen and Grishman, 2015; Huang et al., 2018). The goal of the task is to identify event mentions, i.e. linguistic expressions describing “things” that happen or hold as true in the world, and subsequently classify them according to a (pre-defined) taxonomy. The complexity of the task relies on its high dependence on the context of occurrence of the expressions that may trigger an event mention. Indeed, the eventiveness of an expression is prone to ambiguity because there exists a continuum between eventive and non-eventive readings in the space of event semantics (Araki et al., 2018). Such intrinsic ambiguity of event expressions challenges the generalisation abilities of stochastic models and allows investigating advantages and limits of transfer learning approaches when semantics has a pivotal role in the resolution of a problem/task. We explore different multi-lingual and cross-lingual aspects of transfer learning with respect to event detection through a series of experiments, focusing on the following research questions: RQ1 How well do Multilingual BERT fine-tuned models generalise in zero-shot transfer learning scenarios on both languages? RQ2 Do we obtain more robust models by fine-tuning zero-shot models with additional (training) data of the evaluation language? Our results show that Multilingual BERT obtains satisfying performances in zero-shot scenarios for the identification of event triggers (average F1 63.53 on Italian and 66.79 on English), while this is not the case for event classification (average F1 42.86 on Italian and 51.26 on English). We also show that extra fine-tuning the zero-shot models with data of the evaluation language is not just beneficial, but it actually gives better results than models fine-tuned on the corresponding test language only (i.e. fine-tuning and test in the same language), and achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art systems developed using dedicated architectures. Our code is available (https://github.com/ahmetustun/BertForEvent).","In this contribution we investigated the generalisation abilities of Multilingual BERT on Italian and English using event detection as a downstream task. The results show that Multilingual BERT seems to handle cross-lingual generalisation between Italian and English in a satisfying way, although with some limitations. Limitations in this case come from two sources: annotation differences in the two languages and, partially, the shared multilingual vocabulary. Zero-shot systems appear to be particularly sensitive to the fine-tuning data, and, in these experiments, they provide empirical evidence of the impact of different annotation decisions for events in English and Italian. We have shown that extra fine-tuning with data of the evaluation language not only is beneficial but it may lead to better systems, suggesting that the multilingual model may be combining information from the two languages, and thus obtaining competitive results with respect to task-specific architectures. This opens up to new strategies for the development of systems by using interoperable annotated data in different languages to improve performances and possibly obtain more robust and portable models across different data distributions.",1,Language Models

PESInet adopts a modular architecture, with a master NN evaluating the results of two independent BLSTM NNs that work on audio and its transcription. PESInet has been trained with our own three-class, balanced corpus composed of about 1.5 million text phrases and 60,000 utterances of recited and spontaneous speech. PESInet reached an accuracy of 80% on three classes, and 91% on two classes (Question vs Non-question). Finally, PESInet, compared against human listeners on a two-class test based on a different corpus, reached a better accuracy (89% for PESInet, against 80% for human listeners).","The goal of PESInet was to investigate whether clues derived from text could improve the recognition of simple prosodic forms in Information Units (IUs). In particular, we focused on Statement, Question, and Exclamation, which are proposition’s structures and are independent of the pragmatic function of the corresponding IU: each one can assume a large set of illocutionary acts, as explained in the Language into Act theory (L-AcT) described in Cresti (2014). An IU is composed of a textual realisation (i.e., a written phrase) and an acoustic realisation (an audio recording of a speaker uttering such a phrase), and conveys a specific informative intention (Austin, 1975; Cresti, 2000). We designed a modular model based on Neural Networks (NNs), able to highlight how much audio and text affected recognition accuracy. Moreover, to validate our results, we compared our NN model against human listeners, on a set of IUs that did not overlap with the corpus we used to train the model.","PESInet got an accuracy of 80% on three classes and 91% on two classes. Moreover, PESInet reached very good results when compared to human listeners on a totally different corpus. Although this human/NN comparison should be taken with a grain of salt, we believe that it is a hint that the network works well and the results are truly promising. As future work, more recordings should be added to ACorpus and MCorpus to improve the performance of the Audio-based NN and, as a consequence, of the whole PESInet. Currently, we are working on cleaning the code and streamlining the training procedure, as we plan to release the code.",13,Multimodal

It is based on a wide set of features reflecting the different factors involved and tested on different categories of TripAdvisor reviews. For this purpose, we collected the first Italian corpus of online reviews enriched with metadata related to their helpfulness and carried out an in-depth analysis of the most predictive features.","Predicting and modeling relevant factors that determine the helpfulness of online reviews have been attracting growing attention in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. Both practical applications and the interest in studying human variables underlying the assignment of helpful/unhelpful votes are mainly involved. The identification of product reviews that are useful to customers can be important for several e-business purposes (e.g., the development of product recommendation systems) as well as to investigate persuasive elements that make a review helpful for a review reader (Hong et al., 2012; Park, 2018). Several approaches have been devised, differing at the level of predicting methods (mainly regression or classification algorithms) and the typologies of factors considered, including content elements found within the review and contextual ones referring to user profiles. Although various strategies have already been followed, according to the recent survey by Diaz and Ng (2018), a number of issues are still open and deserve to be explored. Among others, they include i) the need for “more sophisticated textual features” that can be useful to model a writing style typical of helpful reviews, and ii) the lack of studies focused on languages other than English. In this paper, we address these open issues and present a study devoted to predicting Italian review helpfulness with a specific focus on the role played by linguistic features in modeling the style of helpful reviews. Similarly to previous studies, we tackled the task as a text classification problem but with two main novelties. Firstly, we relied on different sets of predictors, considering both lexical (content) and structural features (i.e., morphosyntactic and syntactic) aimed at reconstructing the style of a text (the linguistic “form”). Secondly, we investigated which typology of features are the most effective to predict the helpfulness of online reviews and whether they remain the same across different review categories. Our contribution: i) We collected a corpus of Italian online reviews enriched with metadata related to their helpfulness. ii) We developed the first classification system devoted to predicting the helpfulness of Italian online reviews, based on features modeling both lexical and linguistic factors involved, and tested it in two experimental scenarios, i.e., in- and out-domain with respect to the training category of reviews. iii) We identified and ranked the most predictive features, showing the key role played by linguistic features, especially to predict the helpfulness of reviews belonging to a category very different from the training one.","In this paper, we have presented the first approach to the task of review helpfulness prediction for the Italian language. Two experimental scenarios have been tested in a corpus of TripAdvisor reviews belonging to different categories (restaurants and attractions). In line with previous findings obtained for the English language, we confirmed that lexical information plays a significant role in classifying helpful reviews. In addition, we proved for the first time the highly predictive power of linguistic features modeling the writing style independently from the content. This is particularly true in the two out-domain experiments: in the first case (same category, different geographical area), the classifier based on the linguistic features achieves the same accuracy as the model using lexical features, and it even outperforms all the other configuration models when tested on the most distant review category (restaurants vs attractions). Among the possible future issues that we would like to investigate, an interesting one concerns the role played by metadata features. In the reported results, we showed that star ratings are not relevant when considered alone, but they give a plus when combined with both lexical and linguistic features. Beyond this metadata, we would like to extend the analysis to further user information possibly related to review helpfulness.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We discuss in particular the annotation scheme adopted to identify irony activators and some of the issues that emerged during the first annotation phase. This helped us in the design of the guidelines and allowed us to draw future research directions.","In the last decade, several efforts have been devoted to address the challenges of sentiment analysis and related tasks, working mainly in English and other languages such as Italian, Spanish, or French. Provided that most of the existing approaches in NLP are based on supervised semantic shallow analysis and machine learning techniques, there has been a strong push towards the development of resources from where related knowledge can be learned. In particular, the detection of irony is among the tasks currently considered as especially challenging since its presence in a text can reverse the polarity of the opinion expressed, that is using positive words for intending a negative meaning or – less often – the other way around. This can significantly undermine systems’ accuracy and makes it crucial to develop irony-aware systems (Bosco et al., 2013; Reyes et al., 2013; Riloff et al., 2013; Wang, 2013; Barbieri et al., 2014; Joshi et al., 2015; Hernández Farías et al., 2015; Hernández Farías et al., 2016). Additionally, the challenge is further complicated when there is a co-occurrence with sarcasm or satire (Hernández Farías and Rosso, 2016; Joshi et al., 2017; Ravi and Ravi, 2017). The growing interest in irony detection is also attested by the proposal of shared tasks focusing on this topic within NLP evaluation campaigns. For instance, the pilot task on irony detection proposed for Italian in SENTIPOLC at EVALITA, in 2014 and 2016 (Barbieri et al., 2016; Basile et al., 2014), and the related task proposed for French at DEFT at TALN 2017 (Benamara et al., 2017). For what concerns English, after a first task at SemEval-2015 focusing on figurative language in Twitter (Ghosh et al., 2015), a shared task on irony detection in tweets has been proposed in 2018 (Van Hee et al., 2018). Concerning Spanish, the most recent shared task about irony in social media has been organized at IberLEF 2019 Irony Detection in Spanish Variants (IroSvA 2019), exploring the differences among varieties of Spanish from Spain, Cuba and Mexico (Ortega et al., 2019) in which the organizers also proposed a focus on context, stressing the importance of contextual semantics in ironic productions. While the majority of the participating systems in the above-mentioned shared-tasks are based on classical machine learning techniques (Cignarella and Bosco, 2019; Frenda and Patti, 2019), researchers have recently started to exploit approaches based on neural networks. Among these, Huang et al. (2017) applied attentive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that capture specific words which are helpful in detecting the presence of irony in a tweet, while Wu et al. (2018) exploited densely connected LSTMs in a multitask learning strategy, adding PoS tag features, and Zhang et al. (2019) took advantage of recent advancements in transfer learning techniques. These settings are a clear indication of the growing interest for a deeper analysis of the linguistic phenomena underlying ironic expressions. Such kind of analysis naturally calls for the exploitation of finer-grained features and resources in order to improve the performance of automatic systems. For instance, an especially fine-grained annotation format for irony is the one proposed in Karoui et al. (2017), concerning French, Italian and English. The same scheme has later been applied on a new Italian corpus: TWITTIRò (Cignarella et al., 2018a). The resulting annotated corpus was used as reference dataset in the IronITA 2018 shared task on Irony and Sarcasm Detection in Italian Tweets (Cignarella et al., 2018b).","In this article we described the preliminary steps of the annotation process of irony activators in the TWITTIRò-UD corpus, a novel Italian treebank of ironic tweets. In particular, we described the problems that emerged during the first annotation phase, the strengths and weaknesses of the scheme itself, in order to highlight future research directions. Being a preliminary study, and having no benchmark to compare with, the results obtained in the observed agreement are rather promising; moreover, the tweets included in TWITTIRò were retrieved from different pre-existing Italian corpora (as described in Cignarella et al. (2017)): the heterogeneous sources the data were gathered from thus represents a signal of the potential portability of the scheme and paves the way for a more systematic annotation process of the whole dataset. The next steps will then consist in the guidelines improvement and the annotation of the remaining part of TWITTIRò-UD accordingly. Furthermore, the availability of English and French datasets annotated with the same scheme described in Section 2.1 (see Karoui et al. (2017)) allows the direct applicability of the annotation of irony activators in other languages than Italian. While this can be considered a further validation step to test the overall validity and portability of the scheme, it may also provide useful insights into the linguistic mechanisms underlying verbal irony in different languages. The actual usability of this kind of resources will be finally tested when training NLP tools for irony detection, in both mono- and multi-lingual settings.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

To find the solution of a game instance, it relies on MWEs (Multiword Expressions) automatically extracted through a lexicalized association rules algorithm; on a list of proverbs; and on some lists of titles.","“La Ghigliottina” is the final game of “L’Eredità”, an Italian quiz show. In this game, the player should find a word linked to a set of five clue words. For example, if these words are table, works, watch, Premier League and police, the player should give as solution the word calendar. The link between a clue and the solution is usually the fact that both these words are part of an MWE (Multi-Word Expression), e.g. table and calendar are linked because they are part of the MWE *table calendar*. However, there can be also other kinds of links. For example, the two words can be both part of a proverb (e.g. bird and world in the proverb “early bird catches the world”), of a film title (e.g. river and return in “River of No Return”), or they can be linked semantically (e.g. Suarez and bite because of Suarez’s bite to Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup). The task of solving this game was presented as the NLP4FUN task of Evalita 2018 (Basile et al., 2018). To build our system, first, we collected and analyzed a corpus of 296 game instances: 146 from the TV show and 150 from the board game. Second, we built an association matrix launching a lexicalized association rules algorithm, developed by us, on Paisà (Lyding et al., 2014). Then, we collected from the web a list of titles of books, films, plays, and songs; and a list of proverbs. Finally, we tested the system on the game instances collected and we compared it with other artificial players of “La Ghigliottina”, especially UNIOR4NLP (Sangati, Pascucci and Monti, 2018), that obtained the best performance on this task at Evalita 2018 (Basile et al., 2018).","We described and tested Robospierre, a system developed to solve the word game “La Ghigliottina” (the guillotine).

In the future, we plan to improve the extraction of the links in the MWEs by extracting them from a bigger corpus. We also intend to assign at every element in the list of proverbs and in the lists of titles a score that represents how much that element is known.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In particular, the proposed approach is aimed at complementing and enriching the categorization results obtained by employing standard distributional resources. We found that the paths connecting entities and concepts from documents provide interesting information on the connections between document pairs. Such a semantic browsing device enables further semantic processing, aimed at unveiling contexts and hidden connections (possibly not explicitly mentioned in the documents) between text documents.","In the last few years, many efforts have been spent to extract information contained in text documents, and a large number of resources have been developed that allow exploring domain-based knowledge, defining a rich set of specific semantic relationships between nodes (Vrandecic and Krötzsch, 2014; Auer et al., 2007; Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). Being able to extract and to make available the semantic content of documents is a challenging task, with beneficial impact on different applications, such as document categorisation (Carducci et al., 2019), keyword extraction (Colla et al., 2017), question answering, text summarisation, semantic text comparison, and on building explanations/justifications for similarity judgements (Colla et al., 2018) and more. In this paper, we present an approach aimed at extracting meaningful information contained in text documents, also based on background information contained in an encyclopedic resource such as Wikidata (Vrandecic and Krötzsch, 2014). Although our approach has been devised on a specific application domain (PhD theses in philosophy), we argue that it can be easily extended to further application settings. The approach focuses on the ability to extract relevant pieces of information from text documents, and to map them onto the nodes of a knowledge graph, obtained from semantic networks representing encyclopedic and lexicographic knowledge. In this way, it is possible to compare different documents based on their graphical description, which has a direct anchoring to their semantic content. We propose a system to assess the similarity between textual documents, hybridising the propositional approach (such as traditional statements expressed through RDF triples) with a distributional description (Harris, 1954) of the nodes contained in the knowledge graph, that are represented with word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013; Camacho-Collados et al., 2015; Speer et al., 2017). This step allows obtaining similarity measures (based on vector descriptions, and on pathfinding algorithms) and explanations (represented as paths over a semantic network) more focused on the semantic definition of concepts and entities involved in the analysis.","In this paper, we have investigated the possibility of enriching semantic text similarity measures via symbolic and human-readable knowledge. We have shown that distributional approaches allow for a satisfactory classification of documents belonging to different topics; however, our preliminary experimentation showed that they are not able to capture the subtle aspects characterizing documents in close areas. As we have argued, exploiting paths over graphs to explore connections between document pairs may be beneficial in making explicit domain-specific links between documents. As a future work, we could refine the methodology related to the extraction of the concepts in the Knowledge Graph, defining approaches based on specific domain-related ontologies. Two relevant works, to these ends, are the PhilOnto ontology, that represents the structure of philosophical literature (Grenon and Smith, 2011), and the InPho taxonomy (Buckner et al., 2007), combining automated information retrieval methods with knowledge from domain experts. Both resources will be employed in order to extract a more concise, meaningful, and discriminative Knowledge Graph.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Linguistic Insights into Twitter Reactions to the Annual Italian Budget Law,ENG,1,1,1,Università di Bologna,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Bologna,"Relying on linguistic cues obtained by means of structural topic modelling as well as descriptive lexical analyses, this study contributes to the general understanding of the Twitter users’ response to the annual Italian budget law approved at the end of December 2018. Some topics contained in the dataset of tweets are procedural or generic, but besides those, it often emerges that Twitter users expressed their concern with respect to the provisions of this law. Supportive attitudes seem to be less frequent. This paper also advocates that findings from inductive studies on Twitter data should be interpreted with caution, since the nature of tweets might not be adequate for drawing far-reaching generalisations.","In the last decade, the internet has revolutionized human communication and interaction. Among all forms of digitally-mediated communication, social media stand out as one of the most effective. As Boulianne (2017) points out, the effects of social media depend on their nature of use (e.g. source of information; one-to-one/one-to-many/many-to-many communication; networking and relationship-building; expression of opinions; etc.). Nowadays, potentially everyone with a computer or a mobile device having access to the internet can write and share content which may be viewed and debated immediately by other people. The impact of a social media post may be huge, and unlike other prior forms of communication, it can easily cross borders in just a few seconds. In fact, social media make things happen faster than ever before. For instance, Facebook and Twitter were crucial in allowing the Arab uprisings or the Romanian anti-corruption protests to happen more efficiently and on a larger scale.","This paper explored the Twitter users’ reactions to the annual Italian budget bill. STM outputs and descriptive lexical analyses showed that tweets concerned various aspects associated with the object of this study. Apart from talking about procedural and generic issues, users expressed their doubts and disapproval with respect to the measures of the budget law. Generally, tweets supporting this law were less frequent. The findings of this study, although preliminary, might be seen as indicators of what subsequently turned out to be a failure for the first Conte government. Still, as reiterated throughout the paper, the results might not reflect the real attitudes of the Italian voting population, since Twitter users tend to be younger and to have an above-average level of education and political sophistication (cf. Barberá et al., 2015). Moreover, tweets, by nature, might not be suitable for drawing steady generalizations, even if the prospects they offer for content and discourse analysis are indeed significant. Further research on this topic might include the investigation of Twitter users’ reactions by means of sentiment analysis.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

In this paper, we perform a comparative evaluation on datasets for hate speech detection in Italian, extracted from four different social media platforms, i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp. We show that combining such platform-dependent datasets to take advantage of training data developed for other platforms is beneficial, although their impact varies depending on the social network under consideration.","Given the well-acknowledged rise in the presence of toxic and abusive speech on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, there have been several efforts within the Natural Language Processing community to deal with such problems, since the computational analysis of language can be used to quickly identify offenses and ease the removal of abusive messages. Several workshops (Waseem et al., 2017; Fišer et al., 2018) and evaluation campaigns (Fersini et al., 2018; Bosco et al., 2018; Wiegand et al., 2018) have been recently organized to discuss existing approaches to hate speech detection, propose shared tasks, and foster the development of benchmarks for system evaluation. However, most of the available datasets and approaches for hate speech detection proposed so far concern the English language, and even more frequently, they target a single social media platform (mainly Twitter). In low-resource scenarios, it is therefore common to have smaller datasets for specific platforms, raising research questions such as: would it be advisable to combine such platform-dependent datasets to take advantage of training data developed for other platforms? Should such data just be added to the training set, or should they be selected in some way? And what happens if training data are available only for one platform and not for the other? In this paper, we address all the above questions focusing on hate speech detection for Italian. After identifying a modular neural architecture that is rather stable and well-performing across different languages and platforms (Corazza et al., to appear), we perform our comparative evaluation on freely available datasets for hate speech detection in Italian, extracted from four different social media platforms, i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp. In particular, we test the same model while altering only some features and pre-processing aspects. Besides, we use a multi-platform training set but test on data taken from the single platforms. We show that the proposed solution of combining platform-dependent datasets in the training phase is beneficial for all platforms but Twitter, for which results obtained by training on tweets only outperform those obtained with training on the mixed dataset.","In this paper, we examined the impact of using datasets from multiple platforms in order to classify hate speech on social media. While the results of our experiments successfully demonstrated that using data from multiple sources helps the performance of our model in most cases, the resulting improvement is not always sizeable enough to be useful. Additionally, when dealing with tweets, using data from other social platforms slightly decreases performance, even when we filter the data to contain only short sequences of text. As for future work, further experiments could be performed by testing all possible combinations of training sources and test sets. This way, we could establish what social platforms share more traits when it comes to hate speech, allowing for better detection systems. At the moment, however, the size of the datasets varies too broadly to allow for a fair comparison, and we would need to extend some of the datasets. Finally, another approach could be tested, where a model trained on Facebook is used for longer sequences of text, while the Twitter model is applied to the shorter ones.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"
321_2019,2019,23,"Gianpaolo Coro, Giancarlo Panichi, Pasquale Pagano",An Open Science System for Text Mining,ENG,3,0,0,CNR-ISTI,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"Text mining (TM) techniques can extract high-quality information from big data through complex system architectures. However, these techniques are usually difficult to discover, install, and combine. Further, modern approaches to Science (e.g., Open Science) introduce new requirements to guarantee reproducibility, repeatability, and re-usability of methods and results as well as their longevity and sustainability. In this paper, we present a distributed system (NLPHub) that publishes and combines several state-of-the-art text mining services for named entities, events, and keywords recognition. NLPHub makes the integrated methods compliant with Open Science requirements and manages heterogeneous access policies to the methods. In the paper, we assess the benefits and the performance of NLPHub on the I-CAB corpus.","Today, text mining operates within the challenges introduced by big data and new Science paradigms, which require managing large volumes, high production rates, heterogeneous complexity, and unreliable content, while ensuring data and methods' longevity through re-use in complex models and process chains. Among the new paradigms, Open Science (OS) focuses on the implementation of the three ""R""s of the scientific method: Reproducibility, Repeatability, and Re-usability (Hey et al., 2009; EU Commission, 2016). The systems envisaged by OS are based on Web services networks that support big data processing and the open publication of results. Although text mining techniques exist that can tackle big data experiments (Gandomi and Haider, 2015; Amado et al., 2018), few examples that incorporate OS concepts can be found (Linthicum, 2017). For example, common text mining ""cloud"" services do not allow easy repeatability of the experiments by different users and are usually domain-specific, thus poorly re-usable (Bontcheva and Derczynski, 2016; Adedugbe et al., 2018). Available multi-domain systems do not use communication standards (Bontcheva and Derczynski, 2016; Wei et al., 2016), and the few OS-oriented initiatives that use text mining focus specifically on document preservation and cataloguing (OpenMinTeD, 2019; OpenAire, 2019). In this paper, we present a multi-domain text mining system (NLPHub) that is compliant with OS and combines multiple and heterogeneous processes. NLPHub is based on an e-Infrastructure (e-I), i.e., a network of hardware and software resources that allow remote users and services to collaborate while supporting data-intensive Science through cloud computing (Pollock and Williams, 2010; Andronico et al., 2011). Currently, NLPHub integrates 30 state-of-the-art text mining services and methods to recognize fragments of text (annotations) associated with named abstract or physical objects (named entities), spatiotemporal events, and keywords. These integrated processes cover five languages (English, Italian, German, French, and Spanish), requested by the European projects this software is involved in (i.e., Parthenos, 2019; SoBigData, 2019; Ariadne, 2019). These processes come from different providers with different access policies, and the e-I is used both to manage this heterogeneity and to possibly speed up the processing through cloud computing. NLPHub uses the Web Processing Service standard (WPS, Schut and Whiteside, 2007) to describe all integrated processes and the Prov-O XML ontological standard (Lebo et al., 2013) to track the complete set of input, output, and parameters used for the computations (provenance). Overall, these features enable OS compliance, and we show that the orchestration mechanism implemented by NLPHub adds effectiveness and efficiency to the connected methods. The name ""NLPHub"" refers to the forthcoming extensions of this platform to other text mining methods (e.g., sentiment analysis and opinion mining) and natural language processing tasks (e.g., text-to-speech and speech processing).","We have described NLPHub, a distributed system connecting and combining 30 text processing methods for 5 languages that adds Open Science-oriented features to these methods. The advantages of using NLPHub are several, starting from the fact that it provides one single access endpoint to several methods and spares installation and configuration time. Further, it proposes the AMERGE process as a valid option when the best performing algorithm for a certain entity extraction is not known a priori. Also, the AMERGE-Keywords annotations can be used when the entities to extract are not known. Indeed, these features would require more investigation, especially through multiple-language experiments, in order to define their full potential and limitations. Finally, NLPHub adds to the original methods features like WPS and Web interfaces, provenance management, results sharing, and access/usage policies control, which make the methods more compliant with Open Science requirements. The potential users of NLPHub are scholars who want to use NERs but also want to avoid software and hardware-related issues, or automatic agents that need to automatically extract and reuse knowledge from large quantities of texts. For example, NLPHub can be used in automatic ontology population and - since it also supports Events extraction - automatic narratives generation (Petasis et al., 2011; Metilli et al., 2019). Future extensions of NLPHub will involve other text mining methods (e.g. sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and morphological parsing), and additional NLP tasks like text-to-speech and speech processing as-a-service.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis
322_2019,2019,26,"Rodolfo Delmonte, Nicolò Busetto",Detecting Irony in Shakespeare’s Sonnets with SPARSAR,ENG,2,0,0,Università Ca' Foscari Venezia,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Venice,"In this paper we propose a novel approach to irony detection in Shakespeare’s Sonnets, a well-known data set that is statistically valuable. In order to produce a meaningful experiment, we created a gold standard by collecting opinions from famous literary critics on the same data focusing on irony. In the experiment, we use SPARSAR, a system for English poetry analysis and reciting by TTS. The system produces a deep linguistically-based representation at phonetic, syntactic, and semantic levels. It has been used to detect irony with a novel approach based on phonetic processing and sentiment analysis. At first, the evaluation was very disappointing, with only 50% of the sonnets matching the gold standard. Eventually, taking advantage of the semantic representation produced by the system at the propositional level, the logical structure of the sonnet was highlighted by computing the discourse relations of the couplet and/or the final quatrain. In this way, we managed to improve accuracy by 17%, up to 66.88%.","Shakespeare’s Sonnets are a collection of 154 poems which is renowned for being full of ironic content (Weiser, 1983), (Weiser, 1987) and for its ambiguity thus sometimes reverting the overall interpretation of the sonnet. Lexical ambiguity, i.e. a word with several meanings, emanates from the way in which the author uses words that can be interpreted in more ways not only because inherently polysemous, but because sometimes the additional meaning it evokes is derived on the basis of the sound, i.e. by homophones (see “eye”, “I” in sonnet 152). The sonnets are also full of metaphors which many times require contextualising the content to the historical Elizabethan life and society. Furthermore, the sonnets are full of words related to specific language domains. For instance, there are words related to the language of economy, war, nature and to the discoveries of the modern age, and each of these words may be used as a metaphor of love. Many of the sonnets are organized around a conceptual contrast, an opposition that runs parallel and then diverges, sometimes with the use of the rhetorical figure of the chiasmus. It is just this contrast that generates irony, sometimes satire, sarcasm, and even parody. Irony may be considered in turn as: what one means using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect; a state of affairs or an event that seems contrary to what one expects and is amusing as a result. As to sarcasm this may be regarded the use of irony to mock or convey contempt.(Attardo, 1994) Parody is obtained by using the words or thoughts of a person but adapting them to a ridiculously inappropriate subject. There are several types of irony, though we select verbal irony which, in the strict sense, is saying the opposite of what you mean for outcome, and it depends on the extralinguistics context. It is important to remark that in many cases, the linguistic structures on which irony is based, may require the use of nonliteral or figurative language, i.e. the use of metaphors. In our approach we will follow the so-called incongruity presumption or incongruity-resolution presumption. Theories connected to the incongruity presumption are mostly cognitive-based and related to concepts highlighted for instance, in (Attardo, 2000). The focus of theorization under this presumption is that in humorous texts, or broadly speaking in any humorous situation, there is an opposition between two alternative dimensions. As a result, in our study of the sonnets, produced by the contents of manual classification, we have been looking for contrasting situations; while in the sentiment analysis experiment, we have been concerned with a quantitative count of polarity related items. Computational research on sentiment analysis has been based on the use of shallow features with a binary choice to train statistical model (Carvalho et al., 2009) that, when optimized for a particular task, will produce acceptable performance. However generalizing the model has proven to be a hard task. In addition, the text addressed by recent research has been limited to tweets, which are in no way comparable to the sonnets contain a lot of nonliteral language. The other common approach used to detect irony, in the majority of the cases, is based on polarity detection(Van Hee et al., 2018). Sentiment Analysis(Kim and Hovy, 2004) and (Kao and Jurafsky, 2012) is in fact an indiscriminate labeling of texts either on a lexicon basis or on a supervised feature basis where in both cases, it is just a binary - ternary or graded - decision that has to be taken. This is certainly not explanatory of the phenomenon and will not help in understanding what it is that causes humorous reactions to the reading of an ironic piece of text. It certainly is of no help in deciding which phrases, clauses or just multiwords or simply words, contribute to create the ironic meaning (see (Reyes et al., 2012); (Reyes and Rosso, 2013)). We will not comment here on the work done to produce the gold standard which has already been described in a separate paper (Busetto & Delmonte, 2019 - To appear) but see all the file in the Supplementary materials). We simply say that we considered as ironic or sarcastic all sonnets that have been so defined by at least one of the many literary critics’ comments we looked into.","In this paper we have presented work carried out to annotate and experiment with the theme of irony in Shakespeare’s sonnets. The gold standard for the experiment has been created by collecting comments produced by literary critics on the presence of some kind of thematic, semantic and syntactic opposition in the sonnets as to produce some sort of irony. We have used the system available on the web, SPARSAR, to produce an automatic evaluation based on two parameters, phonetic features collapsed according to the theory that treats certain sounds to induce a negative rather than a positive mood. The second parameter is polarity, derived from the output of the module for sentiment analysis available in the system. From a comparison between the critics’ choices and the system’s the result was at first rather disappointing, it stopped at 50% of all sonnets. We then produced a new and much richer experiment by considering the logical structure of the sonnet and the content of the couplet by means of sentiment analysis, discourse markers and discourse relations. This allowed us to reach a final accuracy of 68.88%.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Data processing mostly involved the application of Universal Dependencies formalism and error annotation. First, we parsed the texts on UDPipe trained on the existent Italian UD treebanks, then we manually corrected them. The particular focus of this paper is on a one-hundred-sentence sample of the collection, used as a case study to define an annotation scheme for identifying the linguistic phenomena characterizing learners’ interlanguage.","The increasing interest in Learner Corpora (henceforth LC) is twofold motivated. On the one hand, LC are an especially valuable source of knowledge for interlanguage varieties. They allow in-depth comparisons of non-native varieties, helping to elucidate the properties of the interlanguage developed by learners with different mother tongues and learning levels. For this reason, LC are important resources enabling data-driven studies exploited within several research areas, such as Second Language Acquisition, Foreign Language Teaching, Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis, Computer-aided Error Analysis, Computer-Assisted Language Learning and L2 Lexicography (e.g. (Pravec, 2002; Granger, 2008; McEnery and Xiao, 2011)). On the other hand, LC have raised considerable computational interest, which is closely related to their usefulness in tasks such as Native Language Identification (Jarvis and Paquot, 2015; Malmasi, 2016), Grammatical-Error Detection and Correction (Leacock et al., 2015; Ng et al., 2014), and Automated Essay Scoring (Higgins et al., 2015). In this paper we describe the development of a novel learner Italian treebank, i.e. VALICO-UD, in which Universal Dependencies (UD) formalism is tied to error annotation. The considerations of the annotation process, carried out on a set of one hundred sentences selected from a subcorpus of VALICO1 (see Table 1) (Corino and Marello, 2017), allowed us to test a pilot scheme which pinpoints some of the features of L2 Italian. This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we provide an overview of LC, focusing on Italian resources in particular; in Section 3 we present the data and the error annotation of VALICO-UD; in Section 4 we offer some examples of how we applied literal annotation to the learner sentences (LS) and, finally, in Section 6 we present conclusion and future work.","In this paper we introduced VALICO-UD and proposed an annotation scheme suitable for texts of learner Italian encompassing both UD and error annotation. Our scheme follows the principle of “literal annotation” and takes PoS and dependency morphological-distributional mismatches into account. Our error tag set seems adequate to bookmark errors, providing also a fine-grained description of some of them. There are a number of possible applications for the monolingual parallel treebank proposed in this paper. In the near future, we plan to apply the tree edit distance to LS and TH to measure linguistic competence. Recently, the tree edit distance has been applied to various tasks (Emms, 2008; Tsarfaty et al., 2011; Plank et al., 2015), and a study has formalized the notion of syntactic anisomorphism (Ponti et al., 2018). We aim to explore a correlation between these notions and the linguistic competence to describe the achievements of foreign language learners.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition
324_2019,2019,29,"Elisa Dominutti, Lucia Pifferi, Felice Dell'Orletta, Simonetta Montemagni, Valeria Quochi",Building an Italian Written-Spoken Parallel Corpus: a Pilot Study,ENG,5,4,1,"Università di Pisa, CNR-ILC",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"This paper presents a pilot study towards the creation of a monolingual written– spoken parallel corpus in Italian, featuring two main novelties in the general landscape of spoken corpora: the alignment with the written counterpart of the same content and the spoken variety dealt with, represented by transcriptions of radio news broadcasting.","Nowadays, the contrast between written and spoken language does no longer represent a clear-cut opposition. The emergence of modern communication technologies such as radio, television and new (digital) media led to important changes in the analysis of the diamesic variation. Under this view, the opposition spoken vs. written language is reformulated in terms of a continuum with prototypical written and spoken language at the extreme poles and within which a cline of intermediate linguistic varieties can be recognised, mixing, to a different extent, features of the two. Nencioni (1976) defined the extreme poles of this continuum as the parlato-parlato (‘spoken-spoken’) variety, i.e. casual, spontaneous conversation, and the scritto-scritto (‘written-written’) variety, i.e. planned, formal, written language. Besides the typical contexts envisaging the use of spoken language—which require all participants to be present in the same environment, that the conversation is held in turns and that speakers make sure their messages are getting across—different contexts can be imagined: among them, the radio and television language which, despite being spoken, present traces of textual organisation recalling the written language. Nencioni (1976) qualifies this variety of language use as parlato-scritto (‘spoken-written’), a label that emphasises its hybrid nature characterised by the co-occurrence of traits typical of both written and spoken language. From a different perspective, Ong (1982) refers to this variety as ‘secondary orality’, i.e. “an orality not antecedent to writing and print, as primary orality is, but consequent and dependent upon writing and print”. In addition to this socio-linguistic interest, the issue also bears relevance for computational approaches as it has a substantial impact on the perceived naturalness of human-machine interaction. Indeed, one of the reasons why speech synthesis applications still produce unnatural speech, apart from bad prosody is that written language is generally not suitable, i.e. comprehensible, direct and effective, in spoken contexts (Kaji et al., 2004). With the rise and quick spread of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented-Reality (AR) applications, moreover, the mismatch between written and spoken language styles brings about serious technological limitations because unnaturalness of the virtual agents translates into bad human comprehension and/or distrust in those agents altogether. It is thus no longer sufficient to pass a written message to the speech synthesizer, but such a message needs to be transformed in a form suitable to be spoken in the specific context of use. In order to be able to do this, corpus data is needed such as a monolingual parallel aligned corpus of written and spoken texts about the same content. A corpus designed in this way is of fundamental importance for: a) investigating the features of the parlato-scritto language variety, its similarities and differences with respect to the written language; and b) for creating the prerequisites for the design and development of tools for monitoring the communicative effectiveness of texts with respect to their production mode and for supporting the semi-automatic generation or transformation of texts to be delivered orally. Such a corpus represents an important novel contribution in the area of language corpora; generally in fact corpora target either written or spoken language. Some corpora indeed also include sections with transcriptions of spoken language: see for instance the Brown corpus for English. On the front of spoken corpora, large corpora of spoken Italian were produced, some aiming at specific purposes, like CiT (Corpus di Italiano Trasmesso) (Spina, 2000) or LIR (Maraschio et al., 2004), while others aiming at representing Italian in a wider perspective like C-ORAL-ROM (Cresti and Moneglia, 2005). Some of them take into account only a few aspects of the linguistic variability, mainly the diaphasic and in some cases diamesic dimension. Our Corpus Italiano Parallelo Parlato Scritto (‘Spoken Written Italian Parallel Corpus’, henceforth CIPPS) features two fundamental novelties in the general landscape of spoken corpora: the alignment with a written counterpart of the same content and the type of spoken variety dealt with.","In this paper we have presented our first experiments towards the creation of the CIPPS, a monolingual written-spoken parallel aligned corpus. The data for this pilot was drawn from existing corpora and archives, it was automatically aligned on the basis of two statistical methods and finally manually validated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build such a corpus and more research is needed to improve its potentials and increase its magnitude. Among the open issues to be approached first is the lack of punctuation in the spoken part of the corpus, which makes automatic alignment with the written counterpart too coarse. As mentioned in the introduction, a corpus like ours might also be precious as a training set for the development of a system for transforming written into suitable spoken texts. Although little work has been done in this direction, the time is now ripe to tackle the challenge and we plan to start experimenting with both paraphrasing methods—as mentioned in section 1—and with monolingual machine translation, taking inspiration from Quirk et al. (2004) and Wubben et al. (2012). In this perspective, however, the first necessary step is to increase corpus size and improve alignment.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

The aim is to find similarities and differences in the process of simplification in two typologically different languages. To carry out the comparison, 1,000 sentences were extracted from the two corpora and annotated with a scheme previously used to annotate simplification phenomena.","In recent years, the availability of parallel monolingual corpora has boosted the adoption of data-driven techniques for the task of automatic text simplification (ATS). These corpora are in general aligned at sentence level and consist of complex sentences paired with their simple version. However, except for English which can rely on two large parallel corpora, i.e. the Parallel Wikipedia Corpus2 AUTHOR (ParWik) and the Newsela corpus3 AUTHOR, these corpora are scarce or rather small in other languages. To reduce time and effort required for the construction of parallel corpora, some works tried new approaches to automatically or semi-automatically collect such resources, e.g. AUTHOR, AUTHOR, AUTHOR, AUTHOR. Moreover to take advantage of empirical data, most of these resources were annotated with rules aimed at identifying the typologies of modifications an original sentence goes through during the process of simplification. The inspection can be considered useful for several reasons: it permits i) to detect and classify a set of necessary transformations in TS, ii) to assess if a given corpus complies with user requirements and simplification tasks and iii) to evaluate the impact of simplification operations on target populations. If the corpus investigation also encompasses a cross-linguistic comparison, it might also shed light on peculiarities and similarities underlying the process of simplification across languages. However, so far this last issue has been rather ignored with the exception of AUTHOR, who compared how macro-simplification operations derived from different annotation schemes are distributed in Italian, Basque and Spanish parallel corpora. This paper intends to explore this under-investigated perspective and proposes a cross-linguistic analysis of two parallel monolingual corpora, i.e. the Italian corpus PaCCSS-IT (Parallel Corpus of Complex– Simple Aligned Sentences for ITalian) AUTHOR and the English Parallel Wikipedia Corpus AUTHOR. Through this comparison, the paper tries to answer the following three questions: 1. To what extent can an annotation scheme conceived for the annotation of simplification in one language be used to annotate simplifications in other language? 2. Are there any differences or similarities in the distribution and nature of simplification operations in the two languages? 3. If we find differences, to what extent do they depend on language only, or on the type of corpora? To answer these questions, 1,000 paired sentences were extracted from the two corpora and annotated with the scheme described in AUTHOR. This allows us to carry out a quantitative and qualitative analysis focused on understanding the nature of the modifications occurring in the datasets.","The paper proposed a cross-linguistic comparison between two monolingual parallel corpora for ATS. The comparison tried to answer three main questions. As regards question 1, the annotation stage proved the possibility to use, except few modifications, a language-specific annotation scheme for another language. More than language-specific factors, an in-depth analysis of the annotated pairs of sentences highlighted that the observed differences are due to linguistic phenomena characterizing different textual genres. This is the case for example of modifications due to the insertion of glosses, which is driven by the encyclopedic nature of Wikipedia pages rather than to the specific language. Similarly, textual genre has an impact on the linguistic level involved in the lexical substitution. The higher occurrence of substitutions at phrase level, rather than at word-level, reflects the attempt of Wikipedia editors to make scientific contents clearer and simpler for a wide target population. Corpus-design differences, especially those occurring between manually and automatically derived corpora, may affect the distribution of the simplification operations also within the same genre. This is one of the possible directions that we want to explore in the near future.",11,Text Simplification

The focus is on the subtask where Twitter data was used both for training and testing (HaSpeeDe-TW). In order to highlight the complexity of hate speech and the reasons beyond the failures in its automatic detection, the annotation provided for the task is enriched with orthogonal categories annotated in the original reference corpus, such as aggressiveness, offensiveness, irony and the presence of stereotypes.","The field of Natural Language Processing witnesses an ever-growing number of automated systems trained on annotated data and built to solve, with remarkable results, the most diverse tasks. As performances increase, resources, settings and features that contributed to the improvement are (understandably) emphasized, but sometimes little or no room is given to an analysis of the factors that caused the system to misclassify some items. This paper wants to draw attention to the importance of a thorough error analysis on the performance of supervised systems, as a means to produce advancement in the field. Errors made by a system may entail not only the poorness of the system itself but also the sparseness of the data used in training, the failure of the annotation scheme in describing the observed phenomena or a cue of the data inherent ambiguity. The presence of the same errors in the results of several systems involved in a shared task may result in also more interesting hints about the directions to be followed in the improvement of both data and systems. As a case study to carry out error analysis, data from a shared task have been used in this paper. Shared tasks offer clean, high-quality annotated datasets on which different systems are trained and tested. Although often researchers omit to reflect on what caused to system to collect some failures AUTHOR, they are an ideal ground for sharing negative results and encourage reflections on ”what did not work”, an excellent opportunity to carry out a comparative error analysis and search for patterns that may, in turn, suggest improvements in both the dataset and the systems. Here we analyze the case of the Hate Speech Detection (HaSpeeDe) task AUTHOR presented at EVALITA 2018, the Evaluation Campaign for NLP and Speech Tools for Italian AUTHOR. HS detection is a really complex task, starting from the definition of the notion on which it is centered. Considering the growing attention it is gaining, see e.g. the variety of resources and tasks for HS developed in the last few years, we believe that error analysis could be especially interesting and useful for this case, as well as in other tasks where the outcome of systems meaningfully depends on resources exploited for training and testing. The paper outlines the background and motivations behind this research (Section 2), describes the sub-task on which the study is based (Section 3), reports on the error analysis process (Section 4) and discusses its results (Section 5), and presents some conclusive remarks (Section 6).","This paper presents a detailed error analysis of the results obtained within the context of a shared task for HS detection. In our study, we took into account two types of data: content information, provided by gold standard labels assigned to each tweet; and metadata information, namely the presence of URLs, hashtags and capitalized words. Results prove the importance of considering other categories related to that on which the task was centered. The analysis of performances in relation to URLs poses a controversial result. There are two reasons why tweets collected via Twitter’s API may contain a URL: the tweet may have been cut off and a URL automatically generated as a link to the complete tweet, or the URL may be part of the original tweet and lead to an external page. In both cases, unless the URL is followed, the tweet is likely to be harder to understand compared to a tweet that contains no URL. This may cause lower agreement among human judges, and it is a very complicated issue for automated systems to deal with, especially when the meaning of the tweet is unintelligible without first opening the URL. Tweets containing URLs are, for the time being, less reliable as training data and pose a tougher challenge for Sentiment Analysis tasks at large; we encourage an effort towards solving this issue. As for capitalized words, future work may include investigating how they affect human annotation, as some judges may show a bias towards associating capitalized words to HS or other categories. Furthermore, improvements may come from considering the PoS tags of such words, or the number of consecutive capitalized words. Multi-word hashtags as well need to be treated with care, as they may affect and even overturn the meaning of the whole tweet. Yet, it happens that a hashtag might require syntactic, semantic and world-knowledge processing in order to be fully understood: for example, by comparing the phrase ”stop Islam” with, e.g., ”stop harassment”, we can see that the word ”stop” is not necessarily negative, and it becomes so only because it is followed by the name of a religion whose members are, nowadays and in Western society, particularly subject to discrimination. Overall, our analysis suggests that systems failures are motivated by the difficulty in dealing with cases where HS is less directly expressed and pave the way for future work on, e.g., the development of tools that perform a more careful analysis of the text.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The objective of this study is to better understand the implications of expanding and evaluating the sense coverage of the Latin WordNet, with a view to identifying the most effective method for its refinement and inclusion in the LiLa Knowledge Base of Latin resources. Our test empirically demonstrates the inadequacy for Latin of a common semi-automated approach of expansion and informs potential lines of improvement for the resource.","WordNets are among the most used lexicosemantic resources in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Indeed, their value is such as to warrant the annual Global WordNet Conference, which is now in its tenth edition. In the words of Fellbaum (1998, p. 52): WordNet [. . . ] is perhaps the most widely used electronic dictionary of English and serves as the lexicon for a varity [sic] of different NLP applications including Information Retrieval (IR), Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), and Machine Translation (MT). Since the release of the Princeton WordNet (hereafter PWN) in the mid 1980s AUTHOR, interest in providing WordNets for modern languages has far exceeded that for historical languages. With the exception of the Historical Thesaurus of English, whose purpose is not dissimilar to that of a WordNet but whose distinct structure sets it apart from this type of resource, the only two historical language WordNets in existence today are the Latin AUTHOR and the Ancient Greek WordNets AUTHOR: both have limited lexical coverage and the Latin WordNet (hereafter LWN) is particularly noisy (see Section 3). Their incompleteness poses significant challenges to a number of computational analyses, thus restricting the scope for lexico-semantic research. The study described here falls within the scope of the LiLa: Linking Latin project AUTHOR. In its wider effort to connect linguistic resources and NLP tools for Latin in a Linked Data Knowledge Base, LiLa is conducting a first assessment of the LWN. Besides being structurally compatible with LiLa, a refined LWN is essential to the Knowledge Base as a connector between Latin and resources in other languages, thus meeting a growing need in the field of Linguistic Linked Open Data AUTHOR. This paper describes a preliminary assessment of the LWN with a view to better understanding how to approach its expansion and evaluation: Sections 2 and 3 briefly outline existing research in WordNet evaluation and the structure of the LWN, respectively; Section 4 details our evaluation method; Section 5 discusses our preliminary results; finally, Section 6 summarises our contribution and focusses on directions for future research.","This paper describes a preliminary assessment of the implications of evaluating the LWN carried out in the context of the LiLa: Linking Latin project. The objective of LiLa is to connect linguistic resources and NLP tools for Latin with a view to supporting different lines of linguistic and corpus-based research and to connecting Latin to other languages. Owing to its automatic process of creation, the LWN is lexically and semantically limited, as well as noisy, subjecting its inclusion in LiLa to qualitative revision. For a close understanding of the implications of evaluating the LWN, we formulated a first experiment combining a small, automated extension of the sense coverage on the basis of 100 selected LWN lemmas with a follow-up manual revision of their corresponding synset assignments. The purpose of this experiment was to measure the reliability and feasibility of these two approaches in order to identify the most effective evaluation compromise. Our synset recommender system produced many false positives, with only 0.18% (7) machine suggestions approved by all five raters. Even if the precision of the synset-recommendation algorithm were to be improved, recall would likely still be high due to the unavoidable assignment of modern senses to a historical resource. If applied to the entire LWN, the evaluation method described here, coupled with the additional evaluation of the relations between synsets, would turn this process of revision into an unsustainable effort or, at the very least, one that is not achievable within the scope and duration of LiLa. Moving forward, our plan for the improvement of the LWN will develop into various tasks. The first, ongoing effort is the manual removal of the modern senses originally inherited by the LWN. Next, once cleaned, we will extend the sense coverage of the LWN by manually adding the missing senses recorded by the raters for the 100 evaluated lemmas, careful not to introduce too much granularity (i.e., too many senses with only subtle semantic differences); extract hypernyms, synonyms and bags of words from dictionary definitions AUTHOR, as well as lemma groups from three Latin synonym dictionaries: the Latin-English Handbook of Latin Synonymes AUTHOR, the Latin-English The synonymes of the Latin language AUTHOR and the Latin-Czech Latinská synonymika pro školu i dům AUTHOR. These are all freely available online in XML dictionary format (XDXF) and, combined, can supply the LWN with some 1,050 additional lemmas. Thirdly, connect a graph version of the LWN to textual resources in LiLa to acquire lexical knowledge, and explore the possibility of extracting hypernym/hyponym pairs using syntactic patterns AUTHOR.

It has been implemented a set of functionalities that can be aggregated in different ways, in order to build domain independent conversational systems, which are able to satisfy needs of real business cases. Along with algorithms and techniques for end to end Dialog management, such as Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Question Answering (QA) and Dialog State tracking and policy management, the technical insights leveraged into the platform are described by outlining the requirements and constraints emerging from these on the field experiences.","Over the last years the human computer conversation has been gathering increasing attention due to its promising potentials by opening up a new profits-making market segment. The benefits of using dialog systems are manifold, these systems can answer to complex questions and also handle hundreds, thousands of conversations at the same time, reducing response times and probability of error in repetitive tasks. In General, developing conversational agents at industrial level requires to manage several issues: (i) The lack of real data: in the majority of the real business cases, in our experience, not enough data are available for training pure learning methods, moreover, the research datasets do not fit the industrial purposes; (ii) Domain updates and system maintenance: The domain requires continuous updates (e.g. the introduction of a new product or service) and the delivered system needs the maintenance, update or changes to correct faults and to improve performance; (iii) User Experience: the conversational agent is the front end of the company, multi-modality (i.e. different user experiences depending on different devices) and what the company aims at communicating must be taken into account; (iv) Runtime latency: is required to add no more than few mini seconds to the entire serving stack; (v) Scale and quality of the text collection: in a voice interaction the system cannot answer with a long text document, but needs to answer with a clear short document passage; (vi) Certified Answers: Being the virtual assistant the voice of the company, it must be controlled (i.e. usually the answers and the messages communicated by the assistant have to be certified by the company); (vii) Human in the loop: Although virtual assistants are becoming more and more intelligent, they are not able to satisfy every user need. In this scenario, it would be better a mixed management, combining the use of virtual agent and human operator. In this paper, we describe the Almawave’s developed solution that allows us to quickly design, write and deploy interactive conversational systems without coding, enabling non-technical users (i.e. conversational designers or domain experts) to design conversational agents, and it leverages Natural Learning Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to develop a human-like experience for users. This framework is designed to build multi-turn task-oriented dialog able to solve defined tasks and answer to domain questions. Following, in section 2 related works will be discussed: in section 3, the various goals that have leaded the described solution will be discussed; in section 4 the various modules of the architecture will be fully described; finally, in section 5, we formulate some considerations and lessons learned in the conversational agent field.","In this paper we described the experience in building the Iride conversational platform for the design and deployment of task-oriented conversational agents in enterprise environment. The platform has been built taking into account needs and constraints required by an industrial scenario. We focused on a component based architecture able to maximize the re-usability of the components, enforcing a clear separation between the domain-specific aspects of the dialog and domain-independent ones across the several dialog layers (language understanding, dialog management and knowledge management). Moreover, in order to enable the work of conversational designer, the platform offers a suite of tools for conversational designers. Such architectural choices have been verified testing ""on the field"" the effectiveness and usability of the described solution. Several conversational agents have been developed with this framework, in different business cases and in different domains and languages; these experiences demonstrate that the platform is efficient and easy-to-use and meets the needs of various types of use cases.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems
329_2019,2019,36,"Raffaele Guarasci, Emanuele Damiano, Aniello Minutolo, Massimo Esposito",When Lexicon-Grammar Meets Open Information Extraction: a Computational Experiment for Italian Sentences,ENG,4,0,0,CNR-ICAR,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Cosenza,"In this work we show an experiment on building an Open Information Extraction system (OIE) for Italian language. We propose a system wholly reliant on linguistic structures and on a small set of verbal behavior patterns defined putting together theoretical linguistic knowledge and corpus-based statistical information. Starting from elementary one-verb sentences, the system identifies elementary tuples and then, all their permutations, preserving the overall well-formedness (grammaticality) and trying to preserve semantic coherence (acceptability). Although the work focuses only on the Italian language, it can be proficiently extended also to other languages, since it is essentially based only on linguistic resources and on a representative corpus for the language under consideration.","One of the most interesting approach to handle the rapid growth of textual data emerged in the last decade is Open Information Extraction (OIE). Starting from natural language sentences, it allows to extract one or more domain-independent propositions, scaling to the diversity and size of the corpus considered AUTHOR. Each extracted proposition is represented by a verb and its arguments, i.e. “Maria goes to the party” is a proposition with a relation (the verb goes) that links together two arguments (Maria, the party). Arguments (nouns or noun groups) can have different roles (subject, direct object…) and they can be mandatory or optional. In this sentence, both arguments Maria (subject) and the party (direct object) are mandatory, so it is impossible to remove one of them or the sentence becomes unacceptable from a grammatical point of view. Due to the high field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in which OIE outputs can be used (AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR), numerous OIE approaches for English have been developed. However, being a language-dependent task, OIE systems cannot be shifted from one language to another, i.e. a system created for English is not compatible with Italian. Moreover, many of the proposed OIE approaches rest on unstable grounds. Some of them use heuristics to manage large quantities of textual data, others lack the support of a theoretical basis, outlining the natural language in a reductive way. Differently from the vast majority of existing OIE approaches, we propose a linguistic-based unsupervised system designed to extract n-ary propositions (not only “relation-argument” triples) from natural language sentences in Italian, ensuring domain independence and scalability. Our system aims to identify the elementary tuple(s) from the input sentence, then all its (their) permutations, by adding progressively arguments composing the sentence. After that – according the behavior patterns of the verb – it generates every possible syntactically valid n-ary proposition, granting grammaticality. To reach this result we have combined two types of resources. To gather information about verb behavior in sentences, we grounded our work on the linguistic basis provided by Lexicon Grammar (LG) AUTHOR. In order to obtain a finegrained characterization of arguments, we combine this theoretical knowledge with distributional corpus-based information extracted from itWaC AUTHOR. From LG tables we extract patterns of verbs behaviors, and from itWaC we enrich these patterns with statistical information. Using complex linguistic structures and dependency parse trees (DPT) we can detect verbal behavior patterns occurring in one-verb sentences and generate from them all the possible well-formed propositions, by adding complements and adverbials. The use of formal patterns derived from a theoretical framework allows to better distinguish between necessary verbal arguments and optional removable adjuncts and to verify syntactic restrictions in verb possible structures. Arguments optionality and syntactic constraints are critical features to grant the grammaticality of the propositions generated, also trying to approximate a first level of semantic acceptability.","In this work we have shown an experiment to perform OIE for Italian language, extracting n-ary propositions from natural language sentences, granting well-formedness of the generations. The system relies on a linguistic resource (LG) and on a representative corpus for Italian (itWaC). While these resources are specific to Italian, they also exist for other languages, so the system can be easily extended. In particular, LG tables exist in digital format also for French AUTHOR, English (AUTHOR; AUTHOR), Portuguese AUTHOR, Romanian AUTHOR. Likewise, the itWaC corpus used in this work is part of the WaCky Wide Web corpora collection AUTHOR, which includes corpora of English (ukWaC), German (deWaC), French (frWac). Concerning performances of the system, although the results are encouraging, we are looking forward to further developments. With regard to methodological progress, we plan to integrate novel methods based on deep learning to increase the performance of the system, trying to reduce DP errors and better handle named entities, frozen and semi-frozen bigrams and multi-word expressions. From an applicative perspective, this work will be experimented in Italian Question Answering system, with the goal to improve the ability in reading complex texts and extracting the correct answers to users' questions. Other possible outcomes can include text summarization or other NLP tasks.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis
330_2019,2019,38,"Alina Karakanta, Matteo Negri, Marco Turchi",Are Subtitling Corpora really Subtitle-like?,ENG,3,1,1,"Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Università di Trento",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Trento,"Growing needs in translating multimedia content have resulted in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) gradually becoming an established practice in the field of subtitling. Contrary to text translation, subtitling is subject to spatial and temporal constraints, which greatly increase the postprocessing effort required to restore the NMT output to a proper subtitle format. In this work, we explore whether existing subtitling corpora conform to the constraints of: 1) length and reading speed; and 2) proper line breaks. We show that the process of creating parallel sentence alignments removes important time and line break information and propose practices for creating resources for subtitlingoriented NMT faithful to the subtitle format.","Machine Translation (MT) of subtitles is a growing need for various applications, given the amounts of online multimedia content becoming available daily. Subtitling translation is a complex process consisting of several stages (transcription, translation, timing), and manual approaches to the task are laborious and costly. Subtitling has to conform to spatial constraints such as length, and temporal constraints such as reading speed. While length and reading speed can be modelled as a post-processing step in an MT workflow using simple rules, subtitle segmentation, i.e. where and if to insert a line break, depends on semantic and syntactic properties. Subtitle segmentation is particularly important, since it has been shown that a proper segmentation by phrase or sentence significantly reduces reading time and improves comprehension (AUTHOR; AUTHOR). Hence, there is ample room for developing fully or at least partially automated solutions for subtitle-oriented NMT, which would contribute in reducing post-processing effort and speedingup turn-around times. Automated approaches though, especially NMT, are data-hungry. Performance greatly depends on the availability of large amounts of high-quality data (up to tens of millions of parallel sentences), specifically tailored for the task. In the case of subtitle-oriented NMT, this implies having access to large subtitle training corpora. This leads to the following question: What should data specifically tailored for subtitling-oriented NMT look like? There are large amounts of available parallel data extracted from subtitles (AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR). These corpora are usually obtained by collecting files in a subtitle specific format (.srt) in several languages and then parsing and aligning them at sentence level. MT training at sentence level generally increases performance as the system receives longer context (useful, for instance, to disambiguate words). As shown in Table 1, this process compromises the subtitle format by converting the subtitle blocks into full sentences. With this “merging”, information about subtitle segmentation (line breaks) is often lost. Therefore, recovery of the MT output to a proper subtitle format has to be performed subsequently, either as a post-editing process or by using hand-crafted rules and boundary predictions. Integrating the subtitle constraints in the model can help reduce the post-processing effort, especially in cases where the input is a stream of data, such as in endto-end Speech Neural Machine Translation. To date, there has been no study examining the consequences of obtaining parallel sentences from subtitles on preserving the subtitling constraints. In this work, we explore whether the large, publicly available parallel data compiled from subtitles conform to the temporal and spatial constraints necessary for achieving quality subtitles. We compare the existing resources to an adaptation of MuST-C AUTHOR, where the data is kept as subtitles. For evaluating length and reading speed, we employ character counts, while for proper line breaks we use the Chink-Chunk algorithm AUTHOR. Based on the analysis, we discuss limitations of the existing data and present a preliminary road-map towards creating resources for training subtitling-oriented NMT faithful to the subtitling format.","We explored whether the existing parallel subtitling resources conform to the subtitling constraints. We found that subtitling corpora generally conform to length and proper line breaks, despite the merging operations for aligning parallel sentences. We isolated some missing elements: the lack of time information (duration of utterance) and the insufficient representation of line breaks other than at punctuation marks. This raises several open issues for creating corpora for subtitling-oriented NMT; i) subtitling constraints: a subtitling corpus, in order to be representative of the task, should respect the subtitling constraints; ii) duration of utterance: since the translation of a subtitle depends on the duration of the utterance, time information is highly relevant; iii) integrity of documents: a subtitle often occupies several lines, therefore the order of subtitles should be preserved whenever possible; iv) line break information: while parallel sentence alignments are indispensable, they should not compromise line break and subtitle block information. Break information could be preserved by inserting special symbols. We intend to use these observations for an adaptation of MuST-C, containing triplets (audio, source language subtitle, target language subtitle), preserving line break information and taking advantage of natural pauses in the audio. In the long run, we would like to train NMT systems which predict line breaks while translating, possibly extending the input context using methods from document level translation.",10,Machine Translation
331_2019,2019,39,"Paolo Lorusso, Matteo Greco, Cristiano Chesi, Andrea Moro",Asymmetries in Extraction From Nominal Copular Sentences: a Challenging Case Study for NLP Tools,ENG,4,0,0,IUSS,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pavia,"In this paper we discuss two types of nominal copular sentences AUTHOR and we demonstrate how the peculiarities of these two configurations are hardly considered by standard NLP tools that are currently publicly available. Here we show that example-based MT tools (e.g. Google Translate) as well as other NLP tools (UDpipe, LinguA, Stanford Parser, and Google Cloud AI API) fail in capturing the critical distinctions between the two structures in the end producing both wrong analyses and, possibly as a consequence of a non-coherent (or missing) structural analysis, incorrect translations in the case of MT tools. To support the proposed analysis, we present also an empirical study showing that native speakers are indeed sensitive to the critical distinctions. This poses a sharp challenge for NLP tools that aim at being cognitively plausible or at least descriptively adequate AUTHOR.","The main hypothesis of this paper is that sentence comprehension cannot be achieved independently from a coherent structural analysis. To support this claim, we first present a precise structural analysis that is critical for recovering the relevant dependencies within specific constructions, then we will show that the crucial structural properties captured by the theoretical framework are in fact correctly perceived by native speakers, but not revealed by some widely used Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. This leads to poor performance in tasks like Machine Translation (MT). This argument seems to us especially relevant in those structural configurations in which a nonlocal dependency must be established: in parsing, for instance, interpreting correctly a whdependency requires that the dependent (the whphrase) and the dependee (the head selecting the whphrase as its argument/modifier) are identified, and the nature of the dependence disambiguated (e.g. argument vs. modifier). In (1) we exemplify the special case of a non-local dependency between a whPP and a DP it depends on (a co-indexed underscore signals the possible extraction sites, hence the dependent constituent; the diacritic “*” prefixes, as usual, illegal sites): (1) [Di quale segnale]i [i telescopi *_ i] hanno Of which signal the telescopes have scoperto *_i[un’interferenza _ i]? discoveredan interference? ‘[which signal]i did the telescopes discover an interference of _ i?’ The second DP un’interferenza (an interference) (the internal argument) is the dependee of the whphrase and neither the subject DP nor the predicate can host this whdependency instead. According to Google Translate (as of 12th July 2019), this second option seems indeed a viable one: (2) What signal did the telescopes find an interference? The translation is ill formed being the internal argument of find filled both by the whphrase and the DP an interference (which cannot take a whDP as its own argument due to the absence of a relevant preposition). In this work we focus on a similar non-local dependency involving two kinds of copular sentences: Inverse (3.a) and Canonical (3.b). Using these constructions, we will test the availability of whPP sub-extraction from both the first and the second DP as exemplified in (4). (3) a. le foto del muro sono la causa della rivolta the pictures of the wall are the cause of the riot b. la causa della rivolta sono le foto del muro the cause of the riot are the pictures of-the wall ‘the cause of the riot is the pictures of the wall’ (4) a. [Di quale rivolta]i le foto del muro sono of which riot the pictures of_the wall are la causa _ i ? the cause b. [Di quale muro]i le foto _ i sono of which riot the pictures of the wall are la causa della rivolta? the cause of_the riot In the first part of this paper (§2), we will briefly present an analysis for these constructions, then we will demonstrate that native speakers are selectively sensitive both to the copular structural configuration (Canonical vs. Inverse) and to the extraction site (subject vs. predicate) (§3). In §4 we will test the insensibility of some freely available NLP tools (Google Translate, the Natural Language service of Google Cloud AI API, UDpipe, Stanford Parser and LinguA) to the syntactic oppositions previously discussed.","In this paper we demonstrated that nominal copular sentences constitute a clear challenge for the computational analysis since the same string of elements [DP V DP] can have in principle two different syntactic representations (hence two different meanings), depending on which kind of copular sentence is realized (Canonical or Inverse). In this paper, we spotted various glitches in the automatic analyses which in the end led either to significant failures (Google Translate) or to rough structural hypotheses that bluntly ignore the relevant contrasts here discussed. Our empirical study, testing both online and offline the whPP sub-extraction possibilities from both subject and predicate DPs, shows that native speakers are sensitive with respect to the different structural roles; in addition, they perceive as expected the underlying structural representation of Canonical vs. Inverse copular construction. None of the NLP tools we tested succeeded in providing a full set of coherent analyses, with the exception of the Stanford Parser for English that at least succeeded in analyzing correctly the canonical copular sentences. This analysis was however insufficient in the case of inverse constructions and in case of sub-extraction, confirming that non-local dependencies are critical configurations native speakers are able to parse but machine do not, yet.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

Specifically, we calculated the following frequency types: occurrences of content words, (lemma and word-form values), occurrences of canonical idioms (e.g., Paolo broke the ice), occurrences of syntactically manipulated idioms (e.g., The ice was suddenly broken by Paolo). We discuss the results of correlational analyses.","Several psycholinguistic norms are available for pictures and words (e.g., AUTHOR; AUTHOR; JAUTHOR; AUTHOR). However, this is less frequent for longer word-combinations, such as idiomatic expressions. An idiomatic expression comprises several words whose overall figurative meaning is not a direct function of its components AUTHOR. For instance, the Italian idiomatic expression rompere il ghiaccio (“break the ice”) means “to take the initiative in an embarrassing situation” and thus its global meaning is far from the meaning of its components. Some norms are available in English (AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR; TAUTHOR), in French (AUTHOR; AUTHOR), in Bulgarian (AUTHOR), in German (AUTHOR) and in Italian (AUTHOR). These databases collect mean values obtained from subjective ratings for some relevant psycholinguistic variables (such as age of acquisition, familiarity, meaning knowledge, etc.). The existence of norms for idiomatic expressions has made it possible to account for issues concerning the comprehension, the production and the lexical storage of idioms (e.g., AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR). There are different theories on the topic of how idioms are stored in memory. According to some authors, idioms correspond to lexical units (e.g., AUTHOR), whereas for others, they are stored as configurations of words AUTHOR. As claimed by AUTHOR, “it is therefore obvious that no empirical test of the different views of idiom processing is possible without first collecting norms for idioms”.","In the present study, we pursued the main goal of collecting objective frequency values of idioms and evaluating their relation with a set of subjective variables available for Italian idiomatic AUTHOR. The novelty of our methodology allowed us to obtain corpus-based frequency values not only for content-words composing idioms (as reported in other normative data available for other languages, e.g., AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR), but also for idioms considered in their entirety. Furthermore, frequency values took into account also the occurrences of syntactically manipulated idioms (passive form, left dislocation, etc.). The possibility of having objective frequency values of idiomatic expression can be an important support for directing future research on idiom processing. Recent psycholinguistic studies (e..g, AUTHOR) have questioned the hypothesis that the so-called 'idiom superiority effect' namely, the established fact that idiomatic expressions are faster to process than literal sentences -is due to the idiomaticity itself of the expressions. According to the authors, the phenomenon could depend, more simply, on the fact that the idiomatic expressions adopted in most of the existing experimental studies were much more familiar than the literal sentences of control to which they were compared, which, in many cases, were completely new expressions, obtained by manipulating in part the idiomatic expressions of origin. A possible continuation of these studies could involve the implementation of experiments, in which idiomatic and literal expressions are matched for the objective frequency of occurrence, as well as a series of other well-known parameters. Moreover, studies aiming to explore the syntactic behavior of idioms might rely on objective frequency values of idioms occurring in a non-canonical form and explore the type and the percentage of manipulations for each idiomatic expression.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In order to carry the experiment we built a feed-forward neural network with traditional sparse n-hot encoding using the Keras open source library.,"It is generally accepted that dreams are just an unconscious production, and that represent a type of non-manipulable happening. However, many people believe that dreams are premonitory of future events as well as representations and reworkings of past events. Humans tend to preserve all personal events, some of them in the form of a diary, namely the best method to tell an event and keep its aura of magic. Until recently, dream reports were relegated to the the pages of paper journals or revealed to familiar people. At an earlier time, dreams are gathered from sleep research labs, psycho-therapeutic and in patient settings, personal dream journals and occasionally classroom settings where “most recent dreams” and “most vivid dreams” are collected as in AUTHOR. Social media have opened millions of pages where people feel at ease to confess their thoughts, their experience and even their secret fantasies. These platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and web blogs are a good ground for computational text analysis research in social science and mental health assessment via language. The recent development of web communities focused on telling dreams allows researchers to access and discover new characteristics related to the language of dreams. Stylistic and linguistic features of dreams in blog reports are essential in order to detect writing style and content differences between men and women, but also enable future researches associated to the different types of personality and styles associated with mental health diagnoses and therapeutic outcomes. The aim of this paper is to show that despite dreams are just an unconscious production, there are several stylistic differences between the reports of dreams by males and females on online blogs. The model we built is able to represent and classify all stylistic differences. Moreover, this research represents a preliminary step in the field of dream tales which will be followed by an attempt to find stylistic differences between dream tales and other forms of self narration (i.e. travel tales).

CROATPAS is a corpus-based digital collection of verb valency structures with the addition of semantic type specifications (SemTypes) to each argument slot, which is currently being developed at the University of Pavia. Salient verbal patterns are discovered following a lexicographical methodology called Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA,AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR), whereas SemTypes – such as [HUMAN], [ENTITY] or [ANIMAL] – are taken from a shallow ontology shared by both TPAS and the Pattern Dictionary of English Verbs (PDEV2, AUTHOR; AUTHOR). The theoretical framework the resource relies on is Pustejovsky’s Generative Lexicon theory (AUTHOR), in light of which verbal polysemy and metonymic argument shifts can be traced back to compositional operations involving the variation of the SemTypes associated to the valency structure of each verb. The corpus used to identify verb patterns in CROATPAS is the Croatian Web as Corpus (hrWac 2.2, RELDI PoS-tagged) AUTHOR, which contains 1.2 billion types and is available on the Sketch Engine AUTHOR. The potential uses and purposes of the resource range from multilingual pattern linking between compatible resources to computer-assisted language learning (CALL).","Nowadays, we live in a time when digital tools and resources for language technology are constantly mushrooming all around the world. However, we should remind ourselves that some languages need our attention more than others if they are not to face – to put it in Rehm and Hegelesevere’s words – “a steadily increasing and rather severe threat of digital extinction” AUTHOR. According to the findings of initiatives such as the META-NET White Paper Series (AUTHOR; AUTHOR), we can state that Croatian is unfortunately among the 21 out of 24 official languages of the European Union that are currently considered under-resourced. As a matter of fact, Croatian “tools and resources for […] deep parsing, machine translation, text semantics, discourse processing, language generation, dialogue management simply do not exist” (AUTHOR). An observation that is only strengthened by the update study carried out by AUTHOR, which shows that, in comparison with other European languages, Croatian has weak to no support as far as text analytics technologies go and only fragmentary support when talking of resources such as corpora, lexical resources and grammars. In this framework, a semantic resource such as CROATPAS could play its part not only in NLP, (e.g. multilingual pattern linking between other existing compatible resources), but also in automatic machine translation, computer-assisted language learning (CALL) and theoretical and applied cross-linguistic studies. The paper is structured as follows: first a detailed overview of the resource is presented (Section 2), followed by its theoretical underpinnings (Section 3) and a summary of the Croatianspecific challenges we faced while building the resource editor (Section 4). An overview of the existing related works is given in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 hints at the creation of a multilingual resource linking CROATPAS, TPAS (Italian) and PDEV (English) patterns and explores CROATPAS’s potential for computerassisted L2 teaching and learning.","In this paper, we introduced CROATPAS, a corpus-based digital collection of verb valency structures with the addition of semantic type specifications (SemTypes) to each argument slot. The resource relies on Pustejovsky’s Generative Lexicon theory (AUTHOR; AUTHOR) (Section 3) and is made up of four key-components, namely: 1) a representative corpus of contemporary Croatian (hrWac 2.2. RELDI PoS-tagged); 2) a shallow ontology of SemTypes; 3) a methodology for Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA, AUTHOR); and 4) the adequate corpus tools (Sketch Engine). We discussed the Croatian-specific challenges we faced while building the editor in Section 4, and provided an overview of the existing related works in Section 5. In Section 6, we anticipated the future multilingual linking of verb patterns from CROATPAS, TPAS and PDEV, which could provide a resource to be exploited in NLP, automatic translation and both theoretical and applied cross-linguistic studies. Moreover, CROATPAS could become an interesting tool for computer-assisted language learning (CALL).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We leverage recent results in transfer learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP) using pre-trained deep contextualized word embeddings in a sequence-to-sequence architecture based on pointer-generator networks. We evaluate our approach on the two largest summarization datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and the recent Newsroom dataset. We show how using pre-trained contextualized embeddings on Newsroom improves significantly the state-of-the-art ROUGE-1 measure and obtains comparable scores on the other ROUGE values.,"The amount of human generated data is outstanding: every day we generate about 2 quintillion bytes of unstructured data and this number is expected to grow. With such a huge amount of information, swiftly accessing and comprehending large piece of textual data is becoming more and more difficult. Automatic text summarization constitutes a powerful tool which can provide a useful solution to this problem. In recent years, automatic text summarization systems have gained a considerable amount of research interest due to deep learning powered NLP impressive results (AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR). Neural network (NN) based approaches have always been considered data hungry techniques because they often require a large amount of training data, but, in the latest years, several works have made a huge contribution in this direction (AUTHOR; AUTHOR; AUTHOR). Text summarization systems can be divided into two main categories: Extractive and Abstractive AUTHOR. The first generate summaries by purely copying the most representative chunks from the source text (AUTHOR; AUTHOR), while in the second summarization algorithms make up summaries by using novel phrases and words in order to rephrase and compress the information in the source text AUTHOR. Some works shed light on using both approaches through hybrid neural architectures attempting to gather the best characteristics of each world (AUTHOR; AUTHOR). NLP has seen a tremendous amount of attention after several deep learning based important results (AUTHOR; AUTHOR). Most of them relied on the concept of distributed representation of words, defining them as real-valued vectors learned from data (AUTHOR; AUTHOR). Recent results were able to generate richer word embeddings by exploiting their linguistic context in order to model word polysemy AUTHOR. In this paper, we build upon the work of AUTHOR on the Pointer-Generator Network for text summarization by integrating it with recent advances in transfer learning for NLP with deep contextualized word embeddings, namely an ELMo model AUTHOR. We show that, using pre-trained deep contextualized word embeddings, integrating them with pointer-generator networks and learning the ELMo parameters for combining the various model layers together with the text summarization model, we can improve substantially some of the ROUGE evaluation metrics. Our experiments were based on two datasets commonly used to evaluate this task: CNN/Daily Mail AUTHOR and Newsroom AUTHOR.","In this work we leveraged recent results in transfer learning for NLP with deep contextualized word embeddings in conjunction with pointer-generator NN for automatic abstractive text summarization. We noticed a considerable increase of model’s performance in terms of the ROUGE score, achieving state-of-the-art on the Newsroom dataset for the ROUGE-1 metric. This is a dataset designed for testing abstractive systems while the other dataset (CNN/Daily Mail) contains summaries formed by sentences extracted from the original texts and it is more suitable for testing extractive systems. Then, it is reasonable that we got improvements only when using the Newsroom dataset. Intrinsic, corpus-based metrics based on string overlap, string distance, or content overlap, such as BLEU and ROUGE, suffer from the need to have a reference output provided by the gold standard corpus in order to evaluate the system outputs. That seems very problematic (e.g. see AUTHOR) because the reference summary is only one of the possible summaries that humans can produce. By looking at the supplementary material regarding some examples of our system output, one can immediately recognize that, even if very different from the reference one, the summaries produced by the proposed system are in most cases acceptable. The definition of proper metrics capturing in the right way the correctness of system outputs remains, in our opinion, a critical open issue. As discussed also in the recent review by AUTHOR about Machine Translation (MT) metrics, “When reference translations are used [...] MT outputs that are very similar to the reference translation are boosted and not similar MT outputs are penalised even if they are good”, the so-called “reference bias”. The same metrics are currently used also in text summarization leading to similar problems.",1,Language Models

In addition to its other capabilities, KIParla provides access to a wide range of metadata that characterize both the participants and the settings in which the interactions take place. Furthermore, it is designed to be shared as a free resource tool through the NoSketch Engine interface and to be expanded as a monitor corpus.","The aim of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of a new resource tool for the study of spoken Italian. The KIParla corpus is the result of a joint collaboration between the Universities of Bologna and Turin and is open to further partnerships in the future. It is characterized by a number of innovative features. In addition to providing access to a wide range of metadata concerning the speakers and the setting in which the interactions take place, it offers transcriptions time-aligned with audio files and is designed to be expanded and upgraded through the addition of independent modules, constructed with a similar attention to the metadata; moreover, it is completely open-access and makes use of open-access technologies, such as the NoSketch Engine platform. Section 2 provides a detailed description of the corpus design, aimed at featuring the geographic, social and situational variation that characterizes spoken Italian. In Section 3 we discuss corpus implementation, describing how data have been collected in adherence with ethical requirements, how they have been treated and transcribed, and how they have been made accessible and searchable through NoSketch Engine. Section 4 focuses on the incremental modularity of the corpus, which makes it an open monitor corpus of spoken Italian. The two modules that constitute the current core of KIParla, namely KIP and ParlaTO, are then briefly illustrated, and some prospects for future developments are outlined.","The ParlaTO corpus has been added to the KIP corpus, thereby creating two modules within the larger KIParla corpus. We aim to make this resource grow over time through subsequent additions and upgrades. The leading idea is that the greater the variety of interactions, speakers, and geographical areas recorded in the KIParla data, the more the corpus will become representative of the language(s) and language varieties spoken in Italy. Moreover, as the corpus is upgraded over time, it will tell us more and more about the sociolinguistic situation in the Italian peninsula. We envision the future development of the corpus to proceed in two main directions. On the one hand, we intend to collaborate with existing projects, in order to verify whether data already collected for different purposes may be adapted into new modules of the KIParla corpus. The only requirement in such cases is the ability to trace and access a core set of metadata for the speakers (gender, age, geographical information, level of education, and occupation) and for the interaction (interview, free conversation, etc.). Further metadata would of course be welcome. Moreover, new data collection efforts have already started or are scheduled to start in different regions (e.g. in Lombardy). A data collection project parallel to ParlaTO is also planned for Bologna. The second direction along which KIParla will grow has to do with data annotation. For the moment, KIParla data are available as prosodic and orthographic transcriptions, time-aligned with the speech audio file and linked to the metadata of speakers and interactions. Further functions are offered by NoSketch Engine, such as word sketches, thesaurus, and keyword computation. We plan two further stages of annotation, namely lemmatization and POS-tagging, which will significantly enhance data retrieval. Due to space constraints, we are unable to discuss the problems that lemmatization and POS-tagging raise when applied to spoken data (cf. Panunzi, Picchi, Moneglia 2004), and leave such a crucial discussion to future work.",13,Multimodal
337_2019,2019,46,"Alessandro Mazzei, Michele Monticone, Cristian Bernareggi",Evaluating Speech Synthesis on Mathematical Sentences,ENG,3,0,0,Università di Torino,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Turin,"In this paper we present the main features of a rule-based architecture to transform a LATEX encoded mathematical expression into its equivalent mathematical sentence form, i.e. a natural language sentence expressing the semantics of the mathematical expression. Moreover, we describe the main results of a first human based evaluation of the system for Italian language focusing on speech synthesis engines.","Computational linguistics can help people in many ways, especially in the field of assistive technologies. In the case of mathematical domain, blind people can access to a mathematical expression by listening its LATEX source. However, this process has several drawbacks. First of all, it assumes the knowledge of the LATEX. Second, listening LATEX is slow and error-prone, since LATEX is a typographical language, that is a language designed for specifying the details of typographical visualization rather than for efficiently communicate the semantics of a mathematical expression. For instance, the simple LATEX expression f (x) is a typographical description and so it represents both the function application of f to x, and the multiplication of the variable f for the variable x surrounded by parenthesis. There are many lines of research to enable people with sight impairments to access mathematical contents. It is possible to embed mathematical expressions in web pages not only as images but through MathML or MathJax (Cervone, 2012) and in PDF documents produced from LaTeX (Ahmetovic et al., 2018). Other research directions concern conversion into Braille (Soiffer, 2016) and speech reading (Raman, 1996; Waltraud Schweikhardt, 2006; Sorge et al., 2014). In this paper we follow another direction: we consider the possibility to produce a mathematical sentence, i.e. a natural language sentence expressing the semantics of a mathematical expression. Indeed, the idea to use mathematical sentences for improving the accessibility of mathematical expressions has been previously presented and experimented for Spanish in (Ferres and Fuentes Sepúlveda, 2011; Fuentes Sepúlveda and Ferres, 2012). However, in contrast to previous work on mathematical sentences, in this work we use a natural language generation (NLG) architecture rather than a template-based one for generating sentences. By using NLG architecture we obtain (i) more portability, and (ii) a major and simple customization of the output. We have two research goals in this paper. The first goal is to describe a system for transforming a mathematical expression natively encoded in LATEX in its equivalent mathematical sentence (cf. Figure 1). The processing flow follows a wellknown approach, called interlingua in the field of machine translation (Hutchins and Somer, 1992). Indeed, the process of generating a mathematical expression from its LATEX source is a two-step algorithm. In the first step the LATEX is analyzed and its semantics is represented in Content MathML (CMML henceforth), a W3C standard for expressing the syntax and the semantics of mathematical expressions. In the second step, the CMML representation is used as input of the S2S (Semantics to Speech) module, that is a NLG module generating the mathematical sentence. Note that the S2S module inserts in the sentence parenthesis and pauses too. The sentence will finally be transformed in audio format encoding by an external synthesis engine. The second goal of this paper is to give a first evaluation of the performance of two distinct synthesis engines in the domain of mathematical sentence. With a pilot experimentation conducted with four blind people, we will compare the perception of the mathematical sentences of a neural network based speech engine and of a formant based speech engine. In Section 2 we will describe the main features of the developed system, in Section 3 we will describe the experimentation and finally in Section 4 we end the paper with some conclusions and introducing future work.","In this paper we have presented a study on the generation of mathematical sentences, i.e. natural language sentences encoding mathematical expressions6 . In particular, we have described the main features of the system and the a first experimentation centred on the evaluation of two distinct speech engine. The results of the experimentation suggests a good performance of the formantbased synthesis engine with respect to the neuralnetwork base synthesis engine. However, more data is necessary to achieve statistical significance. In future work we intend to repeat the evaluation of the system for Italian with a larger number of users and to repeat the experiment by using English lanaguage too.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

In this paper, we tackle this task training an SVM classifier on real data taken from a University statistics exam, showing that simple concatenated sentence embeddings used as features yield results around 0.90 F1, and that adding more complex distance-based features lead only to a slight improvement. We also release the dataset, that to our knowledge is the first freely available dataset of this kind in Italian.","Human grading of open ended questions is a tedious and error-prone task, a problem that has become particularly pressing when such an assessment involves a large number of students, like in an Academic setting. One possible solution to this problem is to automate the grading process, so that it can facilitate teachers in the correction and enable students to receive immediate feedback. Research on this task has been active since the ’60s (Page, 1966), and several computational methods have been proposed to automatically grade different types of texts, from longer essays to short text answers. The advantages of this kind of automatic assessment do not concern only the limited time and effort required to grade tests compared with a manual assessment, but include also the reduction of mistakes and bias introduced by humans, as well as a better formalization of assessment criteria. In this paper, we focus on tests comprising short answers to natural language questions, proposing a novel approach to binary automatic short answer grading (ASAG). This has proven particularly challenging because an understanding of natural language is required, without having much textual context, while grading multiple-choice questions can be straightforwardly assessed, given that there is only one possible correct response to each question. Furthermore, the tests considered in this paper are taken from real exams on statistical analyses, with low variability, a limited vocabulary and therefore little lexical difference between correct and wrong answers. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: we create and release a dataset for short-answer grading containing real examples, which can be freely downloaded at . Besides, we propose a simple approach that, making use only of concatenated sentence embeddings and an SVM classifier, achieves up to 0.90 F1 after parameter tuning.","In this paper, we have presented a novel dataset for short answer grading taken from a real statistics exam, which we make freely available. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset of this kind. We also introduce a simple approach based on sentence embeddings to automatically identify which answers are correct or not, which is easy to replicate and not computationally intensive. In the future, the work could be extended in several directions. First of all, it would be interesting to use deep-learning approaches instead of SVM, but for that more training data are needed. These could be collected in the upcoming exam sessions at University of L’Aquila. Another refinement of this work would be to grade the tests by assigning a numerical score instead of a pass/fail judgment. Since such scores are already included in the released dataset (the degrees), this would be quite straightforward to achieve. Finally, we plan to test the classifier by integrating it in an online evaluation tool, through which students can submit their tests and the trainer can run an automatic pass/fail assignment.",1,Language Models

These games were created within The Croatian Web Dictionary Project – Mrežnik where the author works on gamifying dictionary content. The games for learning the Glagolitic script, sign language, and Braille alphabet will be connected to the entries glagoljica (the Glagolitic script), brajica (Braille alphabet), and the subentry znakovni jezik (sign language) of the entry jezik (language) in Mrežnik. In the paper, each of these games will be presented by stating the game type, mechanics, and gamification elements such as scoring, leaderboards, levels, and badges, etc. The position of these games in the structure of Mrežnik will be shown and the reception of the published games through Facebook likes and shares will be presented. For Glagolitic games, a statistical analysis will also be given to show how many players have completed the game, submitted their results, and replayed the game. At the end of the paper technology used for creating, testing, and publishing these games will also be analyzed.","Games have evolved as a new media and are being more and more used in everyday life. What makes a game more engaging than other media is its interactivity with the player. In a game, content is constantly changing based on players reactions in the physical world. With dynamic content and unlimited ability to do different things in the vir-tual world, games can be used as a powerful tool for educational purposes (Gros, 2007). Some contents in which educational games occur are military schools, driving schools, and hospitals which are using virtual simulation to simulate real-life situations. There are also a lot of websites and aplications for learning foreign languages such as Duolingo and Memrise. Online dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster and The Free Dictionary have some games for learning definitions, grammar, spelling, etc. The popularity of games for educational purposes in all fields can be attributed to new trends such as e-learning, gamification and game-based learning (Strmečki et al., 2015). The purpose of e-learning methods and techniques is to improve the quality of the class, communication between teachers, instructors, students, and other participants in the learning process, and to allow easier exchange and access to learning material (SRCE, 2016). There is no unique definition of gamification. One of the most quoted papers on gamification (Deterding et al., 2011) From Game Design Elements to Gamefulness: Defining Gamification defines gamification as a process which uses the existing game elements in situations which are not considered as a game. Gamification elements, which include scoring, ranking, levels, rewards, ect., are abstracted from many different games. Research has been conducted on the use of gamification mostly in the field of computer science (Ortiz et al., 2016). A study conducted by professor of management Traci Sitzmann (2011) at Colorado Denver Business School demonstrates that staff which completed their training with the help of video games learned more facts and accomplished more skills and long-term knowledge than staff that was trained in a less interactive environment. However, there were many critical points about using gamification elements such as leaderboards because some students don’t do well when they are compared against others they know and scoring can sometimes be misused, misinterpreted or not implemented correctly. Sometimes assignments are not scored correctly or the games or systems automatically give scores to meaningless actions such as clicking the answers without reading the text (Armando et al., 2018). Gamification can also be used in combination with crowdsourcing where the community can play a certain game in which they solve or offer a solution for certain tasks. This type of gamification used through virtual games is called GWAP (Game with a Purpose) where the player is rewarded with entertainment rather than money (Venhuizen et al., 2013). GWAPs challenge players to score high on specifically designed tasks, thereby contributing their knowledge. GWAPs were successfully pioneered in NLP by initiatives such as ‘Phrase Detectives’ for anaphora resolution (Chamberlain et al., 2008) and ‘JeuxDeMots’ for term relation (Artignan et al., 2009). Venhuizen et al. (2013) have created a gaming platform Wardrobe (wordrobe.org) in which players answer multiple choice questions in which they guess if a certain word in a sentence is a noun or a verb or in another game, they must identify correct senses of a word. Players are through their virtual profile awarded with points and virtual achievements to keep them motivated. Player's answers are used for annotating the text. The amount of points the player gets depends on the agreement with fellow players. The working assumption is that the right sense of a word can be determined by the answers given by the players. The answer which has more selection or is selected by a more experienced player in a game is usually considered to be the correct one. However, that doesn't mean that this system of annotion is good because people tend to have wrong assumptions and make mistakes so in the end the overall data is checked by expert annotators. However, if most of the words are annotated correctly by non-expert annotators it makes the job of checking annotation much quicker for expert annotator (Venhuizen et al., 2013). This is one of the examples of using gamification in NLP.","Game design is constantly evolving so we can expect more educational games in the area of language learning and lexicography. In the paper, some examples of games for learning special alphabets are presented and it is shown how they are incorporated within a dictionary project and received by users. These types of games could be applied for other special alphabets of other languages. The compilation of games for Mrežnik is still in progres and many different games for learning grammar, definitions, spelling, etc. are being developed. By gamifying the Croatian dictionary and grammar we can interest children and teenagers but also help foreigners learn Croatian language and culture and popularise language contents. Research on the influence of gamified content on non-native speakers learning Croatian is still in progress within the Mrežnik project.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition
340_2019,2019,50,"Martina Miliani, Lucia C. Passaro, Alessandro Lenci",Text Frame Detector: Slot Filling Based On Domain Knowledge Bases,ENG,3,2,1,Università di Pisa,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"In this paper we present a system called Text Frame Detector (TFD) which aims at populating a frame-based ontology in a graph-based structure. Our system organizes textual information into frames, according to a predefined set of semantically informed patterns linking pre-coded information such as named entities, simple and complex terms. Given the semiautomatic expansion of such information with word embeddings, the system can be easily adapted to new domains.","Textual data are still the most widespread content around the Web (Smirnova and Cudré-Mauroux, 2018). Information Extraction (IE) is a key task to structure textual information and make it machine understandable. IE can be modelled as the process of filling semantic frames specified within a domain ontology and consisting of a collection of slots typed with their possible values (Minsky, 1974; Jurafsky and Martin, 2018). Therefore, each frame can be seen as a set of relations whose participants are the values of the slots. Following Jean-Louis et al. (2011), we refer to such relations as complex relations, namely any n-ary relation among typed entities. Relation extraction techniques have been widely applied to populate semantic frames (Surdeanu, 2013; Zhenjun et al., 2017). However, both supervised and unsupervised methods have shown their limits. On the one hand, supervised approaches (Zelenko et al., 2003; Mooney and Bunescu, 2005; Nguyen and Grishman, 2015; Zhang et al., 2017) model frame filling as a classification task, hence they require labelled data, with the consequent high cost of long annotation time. On the other hand, unsupervised approaches do not need any training data, but mapping extraction results onto predefined relations or ontologies is often quite challenging with this kind of methods (Fader et al., 2011). Moreover, semi-supervised methods exploit bootstrap learning, so that any new relation requires a small set of labelled data to be extracted (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Chen et al., 2006; Weld et al., 2008). Finally, another kind of approach has been proposed, which relies on knowledge bases (KBs) to produce training data. Introduced by Mintz et al. (2009), distant supervision detects relations on semantically annotated texts where entities which co-occur in the same sentence match with entitypairs contained in the KB. Then a classifier is trained using features extracted from the annotated relations (Smirnova and Cudré-Mauroux, 2018). Although this approach has been proven to be effective, the supervised step could suffer from scarce amount of data, especially if the relations occur with low frequency in small corpora. In this paper, we present a system to populate a frame-based ontology, whose values are stored in a graph-based structure. Our method exploits some aspects of distant supervision, leveraging on domain specific KB to infer the relations, and populates the frames with specific information (i.e., the participants) as well as the portions of text (i.e., the snippets) which contain them. Thus, the output of the system for a single frame is a set of snippets, one for each of its slots. Each snippet is also associated with a weight encoding how likely it is expected to contain the information about a certain relation. Such a weight is calculated with a scoring function based on similarity measures and textual distance information. The system has been tested on the administrative domain, with the goal of gathering information related to taxes and agenda events. Indeed, since the KB can be semi-automatically enriched with Named Entities (NEs) and vocabularies of simple and complex terms, our approach can be easily adapted to different domains. Furthermore, system recall can be increased by expanding the frame and attribute vocabulary by exploiting word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013). Our approach differs from existing systems like PIKES (Concoglioniti et al., 2016), Framester (Gangemi et al., 2016), FRED (Gangemi et al., 2017), and Framebase (Rouces et al., 2015) primarily for the notion of semantic frame we have adopted. The works above are mainly based on Fillmore’s (1976) definition of frame as encoded in FrameNet: frames and associated roles describe situations evoked by lexical expressions (i.e. Lexical Units). In our system a frame represents a domain entity (e.g. “tax”) by means of attributes and relations associated to that domain. Unlike FrameNet frames, these attributes and relations are activated by a set of distributed lexico-syntactic cues. This paper is structured as follows: in section 2 we describe the general methodology of the system, we define terminology and notation and we describe the main features of the proposed approach. The system implementation is illustrated in section 3, which shows the extraction algorithm as well as the indexing methods in the knowledge graph. Evaluation and results are reported in section 4.","In this paper we presented a domain independent system for slot filling that exploits a graph to populate a frame-based ontology. The Text Frame Detector extracts a relevant snippet for each frame attribute from textual information with good results in terms of F1 score (0.796). Nonetheless, the evaluation showed that there is room for improvement in some of the TFD modules. For example, the annotation of the semantic neighborhood of single and multiword terms, which are particularly relevant in technical domains, should led to further improve recall performances for complex attributes. Moreover, although we did not adopted Fillmore’s semantic frames in the present work, we would like to explore the possibility of integrating our domain frames with FrameNet ones, which might contribute to enhance the system flexibility. Finally, in the near future, we plan to finetune parameters and to implement additional features such as to associate multiple snippets to the same attribute. Furhermore, we intend to convert the binary features used in the snippet selection system into continuous weights. These weights, along with the collected data about frame population, would be also employed to train a supervised model for slot filling, in order to test TFD across new domains.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis
341_2019,2019,51,"Massimo Moneglia, Alessandro Panunzi, Rossella Varvara",Defining Action Types: on the roles of Thematic Structures and Argument Alternations,ENG,3,1,0,Università di Firenze,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Florence,"The paper focuses on the relation between Action Types (ontological objects that identifies the referential potential of a verb) and the Thematic Structure and Alternations of verbs. The empirical analysis shows that these linguistic features are not properties of the verb itself, but vary in relation to its referential variation. Given this evidence, we argue that Thematic Structure and Argument Alternation can help in the identification of the different types of action to which a verb refers, providing evidences to define the granularity of action concepts in the development of an ontology of actions.","Action verbs are among the most frequent words in ordinary communication, and their correct processing constitutes an underpinning element for a wide series of human-machine interaction tasks. The formalization of action verb meanings has often been linked to propositional representations within decompositional approaches (Dowty, 1979; Rappaport Hovav and Levin, 2012), in which the semantic core of the verb remains a non-analyzed lexical root. Other traditional components used in the representation and annotation of the meaning of action verbs are: the temporal and aspectual properties of verbs (Vendler, 1957; Pustejovsky, 1991); the thematic roles of participants (Fillmore, 1967; Gruber, 1965); the force dynamics and causal relations implied (Talmy, 1988; Croft, 2012; Gärdenfors, 2014). Nevertheless, even if these semantic components are usually assumed to reflect the general structure of action conceptualization, the linguistic and the cognitive levels of categorization are not equivalent and should not be confused (Croft, 2012; Moneglia, 2014). As a matter of fact, the lexical category instantiated by an action verb can refer to more than one cognitive entity. For instance, the verb to push can refer to actions in which the force causes the movement of the object in space (e.g. in a sentence like John pushes the basket under the table), as well as to actions in which the object does not move (e.g. John pushes the fabric into a ball). This differential property is more than enough to cognitively distinguish these events in different action concepts. As a consequence, the need for a cognitive level of action categorization which is independent from the lexical one becomes clear. In this paper, we investigate the role of one type of linguistic information, specifically Thematic Structure and Argument Alternations, in the definition of action types, i.e. types of action concepts that gather together single datapoint in the IMAGACT ontology of actions. We point out that Thematic Structure is not a property of the verb itself, since different structures may be present for the same verb. Our aim is to show how these features are linked to action types and how this correlation can be useful for the definition and the induction of Action Types1 . In section 2, we show the innovative methodology assumed by the IMAGACT Ontology of Action for representing the meaning of action verbs, focusing on their referential properties rather than on their intensional definition. In sections 3 and 4, we will see through a case study that the induction of the referential variation of verbs can take advantage of linguistic features. Thematic Structures and their Alternations can have an impact in the definition and characterization of the objects in an ontology of actions.","In this paper we have investigated the relation between Thematic Structure and Action Types. The empirical analysis reveals that Thematic Structure and Argument Alternations are not properties of the whole verb, but rather of the verb in its Types. We have provided evidence about the saliency of both Thematic Structure and Argument Alternations in the identification of Action Types. Although TS and AA do not determine the variation of a verb across different ATs, these linguistic features can, indeed, reveal characterizing features of a Type, helping us in the disambiguation of concepts and in the recognition of the necessary level of granularity in building our ontologies.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In a nutshell, our tool implements a methodology based on three steps: (i) all the Tweets posted by a target user are gathered and processed. (ii) sentiment analysis techniques are exploited to automatically label intolerant Tweets as hate speeches. (iii) a lexicon is used to classify hate speeches against a set of specific categories that can describe the target user (e.g., racist, homophobic, antisemitic, etc.). Finally, the output of the tool, that is to say, a set of labels describing (if any) the intolerant traits of the target user, are shown through an interactive user interface and exposed through a REST web service for the integration in third-party applications. In the experimental evaluation we crawled and annotated a set of 200 Twitter profiles and we investigated to what extent our tool is able to correctly identify hater users. The results confirmed the validity of our methodology and paved the way for several future research directions.","According to a recent study, 58% of the Italian population regularly uses online social networks as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. Such a huge diffusion of these platforms is providing the users with many new opportunities and services, just think that almost everyone now uses social media to get information, discuss, express opinions and stay in touch with friends. Unfortunately, due to the lack of control and the absence of a clear management of the concept of identity of the users, social networks have become the perfect place to spread hate against minorities and people having different cultures, values and opinions. As pointed out by several works (Mathew et al., 2018), the diffusion of hate speeches in online social media is continuously growing and the countermeasures adopted by the single platforms are neither effective nor timely, even if a big effort is done to make the process of removing hate speeches faster and more precise2 . Accordingly, the research line related to the development of tools and methods for the automatic detection of hate speeches gained more and more attention. Techniques for detecting hate speeches are obviously based on NLP techniques, and range from simple lexicon-based approaches (Gitari et al., 2015) to more sophisticated techniques that exploit word embeddings (Djuric et al., 2015) and deep learning methods (Badjatiya et al., 2017). Similar research attempts were also proposed for the Italian language. One of the most popular initiative is the Italian HateMap project (Musto et al., 2016), a research project that exploits semantic analysis and opinion mining to identify the most-at-risk areas of the Italian country, that is to say, the areas where the users more frequently publish hate speeches. The interest of the research community for the topic was confirmed by the recent work by Bosco et al. (Bosco et al., 2017), who studied hate speech against immigrants, and by Anzovino et al. (Anzovino et al., 2018) who detected misogyny on Twitter. Moreover, as shown by the organization of a specific task in the EVALITA evaluation campaign, an important effort is now devoted to the automatic detection of misogyny (Fersini et al., 2018) and hate speeches in general (Bosco et al., 2018; Basile et al., 2019). In order to continue the investigation in this research line ACMOS3 , a no-profit association based in Torino, recently launched ”Contro l’Odio4 ”, a joint research project with the University of Bari, University of Torino and several local associations. The project aims to develop tools and methodologies to monitor (and hopefully tackle) online hate speeches and intolerant behaviors. One of the outcomes of the research is HATE CHECKER, a tool that aims to automatically identify hater users on Twitter by exploiting sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques. The distinguishing aspect of the tool with respect to the work we have previously introduced is the focus of the tool itself. Indeed, differently from most of the literature, that focused on the analysis of single Tweets, HATE CHECKER aims to analyze the users as a whole, and to identify hater users rather than hate speeches. Clearly, both the tasks are in close correlation, since techniques to detect hate speeches can be used to detect hater users as well. However, through this work we want to move the focus on the latter since, up to our knowledge, this a poorly investigated research direction. Just think that no datasets of hater users is currently publicly available. To sum up, the contributions of the work can be summarized as follows: • We present a workflow that allows to detect hater users in online social networks; • We evaluate several configurations (on varying of lexicons and sentiment analysis algorithms) of the pipeline and we identified the most effective one to tackle our specific task; • We share the first publicly available dataset for automatic detection of hater users on Twitter. In the following, we will first describe the methodology we designed to implement our system, then we will discuss the effectiveness of the approach by analyzing the results we obtained on a (publicly available) dataset of 200 Twitter users.","In this work we have presented HATE CHECKER, a tool that exploits sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques to automatically detect hater users in online social networks. Given a target user, the workflow we implemented in our system uses sentiment analysis techniques to identify hate speeches posted by the user and exploits a lexicon that extends that of the Italian Hate Map project to assign to the person one or more labels that describe the nature of the hate speeches she posted. As future work, we plan to arrange a user study, specifically designed for young people, to evaluate the effectiveness of the system as a Quantified Self tool (Musto et al., 2018), that is to say, to improve the awareness of the users towards the behavior of other people in their social network.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We show that indomain (YouTube) embeddings perform better than previously used generic embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most of the tasks. We also show that a simple method for creating sentiment-aware embeddings outperforms previous strategies, and that sentiment embeddings are more informative than plain embeddings for the SenTube tasks.","Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, on social media is by now a well established task, though surely not solved (Liu et al., 2005; Barnes et al., 2017). Part of the difficulty comes from its intrinsic subjective nature, which makes creating reliable resources hard (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2017). Another part comes from its heavy interaction with pragmatic phenomena such as irony and world knowledge (Nissim and Patti, 2017; Basile et al., 2018; Cignarella et al., 2018; Van Hee et al., 2018). And another difficulty comes from the fact that given a piece of text, be it a tweet, or a review, it isn’t always clear what exactly the expressed sentiment (should there be any) is about. In commercial reviews, for example, the target of a user’s evaluation could be a specific aspect or part of a given product. Aspect-based sentiment analysis has developed as a subfield to address this problem (Thet et al., 2010; Pontiki et al., 2014). The SenTube corpus (Uryupina et al., 2014) has been created along these lines. It contains English and Italian commercial or review videos about some product, and annotated comments. The annotations specify both the polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and the target (the video itself or the product in the video). In Figure 1 we show two positive comments with different targets. The SenTube’s tasks have been firstly addressed by Severyn et al. (2016) with an SVM based on topic and shallow syntactic information, later outperformed by a convolutional N-gram BiLSTM word embedding model (Nguyen and Le Nguyen, 2018). The corpus has also served as testbed for multiple state-of-the-art sentiment analysis methods (Barnes et al., 2017), with best results obtained using sentiment-specific word embeddings (Tang et al., 2014). On the English sentiment task of SenTube though this method does not outperform corpus-specific approaches (Severyn et al., 2016; Nguyen and Le Nguyen, 2018). We further explore the potential of (sentiment) embeddings, using the model developed by Nguyen and Le Nguyen (2018). We believe that training in-domain (YouTube) embeddings rather than using generic ones might yield improvements, and that additional gains might come from sentiment-aware embeddings. In this context, we propose a simple new semi-supervised method to train sentiment embeddings and show that it performs better than two other existing ones. We run all experiments on English and Italian data. Contributions We show that in-domain embeddings outperform generic embeddings on most task of the SenTube corpus for both Italian and English. We also show that sentiment embeddings obtained through a simple semi-supervised strategy that we newly introduce in this paper add a boost to performance. We make all developed Italian and English embeddings available at this link: .","We have explored the contribution of in-domain embeddings on the SenTube corpus, on two domains and two languages. In 10 out of the 12 tasks, in-domain embeddings outperform generic ones. This confirms the experiments on the SENTIPOLC 2016 tasks (Barbieri et al., 2016) reported by Petrolito and Dell’Orletta (2018), who recommend the use of in-domain embeddings for sentiment analysis, especially if trained at the word rather than carachter level. However, a similar work in the field of sentiment analysis for software engineering texts, where in-domain (Stackoverflow) embeddings were compared to generic ones (GoogleNews), did not yield such clearcut results (Biswas et al., 2019). We have also suggested a simple strategy to train sentiment embeddings, and shown that it outperforms other existing methods for this task. More in general, sentiment embeddings perform consistently better than plain embeddings for both languages in the ”tablet” domain, but less evidently so in the automobile domain. The reason for this requires further investigation. Further testing is also necessary to assess the influence of vector size in our experiments. Indeed, not all embeddings are trained with the same dimensions, an aspect that might also affect performance differences, though the true impact of size is not yet fully understood (Yin and Shen, 2018). In terms of different embeddings types, it would be also interesting to compare our simple embedding refinement method, which takes specific contextual occurrences into account, with the performance of contextual word embeddings (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019), which work directly at the token rather than the type level. More complex training strategies could also be explored (Dong and De Melo, 2018).",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The contribution starts from an innovative vision that sees an ever closer collaboration between Cobot, able to do a specific physical job with precision, the AI world, able to analyze information and support the decision-making process, and the man able to have a strategic vision of the future.","In the last century, the manufacturing world has adopted solutions for the advanced automation of production systems. Today, thanks to the evolution and maturity of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), new generation networks, and the growing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) approach, a new paradigm emerges, aiming at integrating the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with business processes, thus opening the doors to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) and that will allow us to join in the era driven by information and further handled with cognitive computing techniques (Wenger, 2014). Robots and humans have been co-workers for years, but rarely have we been truly working together. This may be about to change with the rise of Collaborative Robotics (Colgate et al., 1996). Collaborative Robots (better known as Cobots) are specifically designed for direct interaction with a human within a defined collaborative work-space, i.e., a safeguard space where the robot and a human can perform tasks simultaneously during an automatic operation. Then, human-robot collaboration fosters various levels of automation and human intervention. Tasks can be partially automated if a fully automated solution is not economical or too complex. Therefore, manufacturers may benefiting from the rising of AI-driven automation, and the progress of Adaptable End Effectors devices, mounted at the end of Cobot’s arms, may help to perform specific intelligent tasks (Dubey and Crowder, 2002). The way in which Cobots and humans interact, exchanging and conveying information, is fundamental. The key role in this landscape would be addressed by Conversational Interfaces (Zue and Glass, 2000), which exploit and take advantages from the recent achievements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), to understand user need and generate the right answer or action. In this scenario, Computer Vision also plays an important role in the process of creating collaborative environments between humans and robots. Systems of this type are already introduced into the industry to facilitate tasks of product quality control or component assembly inspection. By giving vision to a robot, it can make it able to understand the industrial environment that surrounds it and can improve the execution of tasks in support to other people. Improving robots software with AI will be key to making robots more collaborative. The work starts from an innovative vision that beholds, in the future, an ever closer collaboration between Cobot, able to do a specific physical job with precision and without alienation, the AI world, able to analyze, process, and learn from information and support the decision-making process, and the employee able to have a strategic vision of the future. To validate its effectiveness, a collaborative environment between employee, Cobot and AI systems has been crafted to make possible the three subjects communicate in a simple way and without requiring the employee to have specific skills to interact with the Cobot and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Our contribution is indeed placed in this scenario where the convergence of multiple technologies allows us to define a new approach related to the management of a core business process (e.g. shipments) which tends to ensure more and more flexibility of the process thanks to a simplification of human interaction with Cyber-Physical Systems, with a better coordination between the physical world (the packaging line), and that of IT processes (the ERP model). In the belief that the complexity of new industrial production systems requires interdisciplinary skills, our intents are to bring together knowledge from related disciplines such as computational linguistics, cognitive science, machine learning, computer vision, humanmachine interaction, and collaborative robotics automation towards an integrated novel approach specifically designed for the smart management of a manufacturing process line by fostering and strengthening the synergy and the interaction between robot and human. Our research is broadly situated in HumanRobot Collaboration (HRC), a promising robotics discipline focusing on enabling robots and humans to operate jointly to complete collaborative tasks. Recent works tried to figure out in which way Cobots may help humans in collaborative industrial tasks (El Zaatari et al., 2019) or in participatory design in fablabs (Ionescua and Schlunda, 2019). An inital study centered cobots in advanced manufacturing systems (Djuric et al., 2016). No or litte work (Ivorra et al., 2018) is done to endow Cobots with cognitive intelligence like conversational interaction and computer vision. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the functionalities and the architecture of our approach, focusing on the main four technological aspects: cobots, adaptable end effectors, conversational interfaces, and computer vision. Section 3 describes the possible scenarios of application specifically designed for our approach, such as Smart Manufacturing. Finally, Section 4 discusses the proposed framework and concludes the paper, outlining future works.","In line with the main objectives, we contributed to the development and validation of a framework in an operational environment of intelligent robotic systems and HRC. In particular, we dealt with conversational interaction technologies useful to perform: (i) high-performance linguistic analysis services based on NLP technologies; (ii) models for the symbiotic human-robot interaction management; (iii) services and tools for the adaptation of linguistic interfaces with respect to user characteristics. The Cobots are close to operating in environments where the presence of man plays a key role. A fundamental characteristic is therefore the Cobot’s ability in reacting to textual and vocal commands to properly understand the user’s commands. The Cobot’s perception is leveraged with its ability to detect object and understand what there is around him; computer vision processing becomes crucial to the extent of giving Cobots a cognitive profile. We therefore envision our framework to be fully operable in complex manufacturing systems, in which the collaboration between robot and man is facilitated by advanced AI and cognitive techniques. We showed how, already today, it is possible to “humanize” highly automated processes through a Cobot, collecting and integrating the operational information in the corporate knowledge base. In fact, we believe that in the long term there will be a convergence between automation, AI and IoT, allowing the market to create a full “Digital Twin” with an organization that will lead to a strong automation of organizational choices driven by data collected in the field. The digitized organization can then be equipped with its own “Company Brain”, an AI able to make autonomous complex decisions aimed at maximizing a business goal that, working in a cooperative manner with the company management, will be able to respond much more precisely and quickly to changes in an increasingly unstable and fluid market.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

The reliability of the annotation, i.e. low interannotator disagreement, is a key factor, especially when dealing with highly subjective phenomena occurring in human language. Hate speech (HS), in particular, is intrinsically nuanced and hard to fit in any fixed scale, therefore crisp classification schemes for its annotation often show their limits. We test three annotation schemes on a corpus of HS, in order to produce more reliable data. While rating scales and best-worst-scaling are more expensive strategies for annotation, our experimental results suggest that they are worth implementing in a HS detection perspective.","Automated detection of hateful language and similar phenomena — such as offensive or abusive language, slurs, threats and so on — is being investigated by a fast-growing number of researchers. Modern approaches to Hate Speech (HS) detection are based on supervised classification, and therefore require large amounts of manually annotated data. Reaching acceptable levels of interannotator agreement on phenomena as subjective as HS is notoriously difficult. Poletto et al. (2017), for instance, report a “very low agreement” in the HS annotation of a corpus of Italian tweets, and similar annotation efforts showed similar results (Del Vigna et al., 2017; Waseem, 2016; Gitari et al., 2015; Ross et al., 2017). In an attempt to tackle the agreement issue, annotation schemes have been proposed based on numeric scales, rather than strict judgments (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2017). Ranking, rather than rating, has also proved to be a viable strategy to produce high-quality annotation of subjective aspects in natural language (Yannakakis et al., 2018). Our hypothesis is that binary schemes may oversimplify the target phenomenon, leaving it uniquely to the judges’ subjectivity to sort less prototypical cases and likely causing higher disagreement. Rating or ranking schemes, on the other hand, are typically more complex to implement, but they could provide higher quality annotation. A framework is first tested by annotators: interannotator agreement, number of missed test questions and overall opinion are some common standards against which the quality of the task can be tested. A certain degree of subjectivity and bias is intrinsic to the task, but an effective scheme should be able to channel individual interpretations into unambiguous categories. A second reliability test involves the use of annotated data to train a classifier that assigns the same labels used by humans to previously unseen data. This process, jointly with a thorough error analysis, may help spot bias in the annotation or flaws in the dataset construction. We aim to explore whether and how different frameworks differ in modeling HS, what problems do they pose to human annotators and how suitable they are for training. In particular, we apply a binary annotation scheme, as well as a rating scale scheme and a best-worst scale scheme, to a corpus of HS. We set up experiments in order to assess whether such schemes help achieve a lower disagreement and, ultimately, a higher quality dataset for benchmarking and for supervised learning. The experiment we set up involves two stages: after having the same dataset annotated with three different schemes on the crowdsourcing platform Figure Eight2 , we first compare their agreement rates and label distributions, then we map all schemes to a “yes/no” structure to perform a crossvalidation test with a SVM classifier. We launched three separate tasks on the platform: Task 1 with a binary scheme, Task 2 with an asymmetric rating scale, and Task 3 with a best-worst scale. For each task, a subset has been previously annotated by experts within the research team, to be used as gold standard against which to evaluate contributors’ trustworthiness on Figure Eight.","We performed annotation tasks with three annotation schemes on a HS corpus, and computed interannotator agreement rate and label distribution for each task. We also performed cross-validation tests with the three annotated datasets, to verify the impact of the annotation schemes on the quality of the produced data. We observed that the RS we designed seems easier to use for contributors, but its results are more complex to understand, and it returns the worst overall performance in a cross-validation test. It is especially difficult to compare it with a binary scheme, since merging labels together and mapping them down to a dichotomous choice is in contrast with the nature of the scheme itself. Furthermore, such scale necessarily oversimplifies a complex natural phenomenon, because it uses equidistant points to represent shades of meaning that may not be as evenly arranged. Conversely, our experiment with BWS applied to HS annotation gave encouraging results. Unlike Wojatzki et al. (2018), we find that a ranking scheme is slightly better than a rating scheme, be it binary or scalar, in terms of prediction performance. As future work, we plan to investigate the extent to which such variations depend on circumstantial factors, such as how the annotation process is designed and carried out, as opposed to intrinsic properties of the annotation procedure. The fact that similar distributions are observed when the dividing line for RS and BWS is drawn in a permissive fashion suggests that annotators tend to overuse the label HS yes when they work with a binary scheme, probably because they have no milder choice. This confirms that, whatever framework is used, the issue of hateful language requires a nuanced approach that goes beyond the binary classification, being aware that an increase in complexity and resources will likely pay off in terms of more accurate and stable performances.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Specifically, they have proved to achieve state of the art performance in numerous complex NLP tasks such as question answering and sentiment analysis in the English language. Following the great popularity and effectiveness that these models are gaining in the scientific community, we trained a BERT language understanding model for the Italian language (AlBERTo). In particular, AlBERTo is focused on the language used in social networks, specifically on Twitter. To demonstrate its robustness, we evaluated AlBERTo on the EVALITA 2016 task SENTIPOLC (SENTIment POLarity Classification) obtaining state of the art results in subjectivity, polarity and irony detection on Italian tweets. The pre-trained AlBERTo model will be publicly distributed through the GitHub platform at the following web address in order to facilitate future research.","The recent spread of pre-trained text representation models has enabled important progress in Natural Language Processing. In particular, numerous tasks such as part of speech tagging, question answering, machine translation, and text classification have obtained significant contributions in terms of performance through the use of distributional semantics techniques such as word embedding. Mikolov et al. (2013) notably contributed to the genesis of numerous strategies for representing terms based on the idea that semantically related terms have a similar vector representations. Such technologies as Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), Glove (Pennington et al., 2014), and FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017) suffer from a problem that multiple concepts, associated with the same term, are not represented by different wordembedding vectors in the distributional space (context-free). New strategies such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), GPT/GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) overcome this limit by learning a language understanding model for a contextual and task-independent representation of terms. In their multilingual version, they mainly use a mix of text obtained from large corpora in different languages to build a general language model to be reused for every application in any language. As reported by the BERT documentation ”the Multilingual model is somewhat worse than a single-language model. However, it is not feasible for us to train and maintain dozens of single-language model.” This entails significant limitations related to the type of language learned (with respect to the document style) and the size of the vocabulary. These reasons have led us to create the equivalent of the BERT model for the Italian language and specifically on the language style used on Twitter: AlBERTo. This idea was supported by the intuition that many of the NLP tasks for the Italian language are carried out for the analysis of social media data, both in business and research contexts.","In this work, we described AlBERTo, the first Italian language understanding model based on social media writing style. The model has been trained using the official BERT source code on a Google TPU-V2 on 200M tweets in the Italian language. The pre-trained model has been finetuned on the data available for the classification task SENTIPOLC 2016, showing SOTA results. The results allow us to promote AlBERTo as the starting point for future research in this direction. Model repository.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Finally we report some comments on this novel dialogue system evaluation method.","The interest in dialogue systems is on the rise in the NLP community (McTear et al., 2016), under the strong demand for the introduction of a natural and effective user interaction in applications, like in the customer care domain (Hu et al., 2018). A related and central issue is the evaluation of such systems. In this setting, it is largely known that most evaluation metrics that come from machine translation and compare a model generated response to a single target response, exhibit a poor correlation with the human judgement (Liu et al., 2016). In this paper we briefly illustrate a task-oriented dialogue system called MuMe (from “MUoversi MEglio”, “travelling better” in English language), and examine how far the evaluation protocol IDIAL (Cutugno et al., 2018) is helpful in its assessment. IDIAL is composed by a usability evaluation (done by a group of users) and by an evaluation of the robustness of the dialog model based on the linguistic variations of the successful interactions with the users. The application being tested is a prototype dialogue system that we developed for the reservation of electric vehicles in the context of a car sharing service. A user must be able to interact with the system, to specify when and where s/he wants to leave and which sort of vehicle is needed. While there are some services and frameworks dedicated to the development of machine-learning-based dialogue systems, like Google Dialogflow or the open source Rasa frameworks, the lack of Italian dialogue corpora in the specific domain of car sharing reservations (see, e.g., Serban et al. (2018)) and the impossibility on our part to recruit a number of people large enough for the creation of such a corpus, forced us to choose a different solution: we developed a simpler and less data-reliant rule-based system, based on slot-filling semantics. Moreover, the decisions made by this kind of systems can be tracked throughout the computation, thereby resulting in the advantage of being quite explainable. This is a desirable feature, since it simplifies the debugging and the maintenance of the routines, and allows an easier extension of the system to meet additional requirements. This paper is mostly concerned with the evaluation of the MuMe system. The structure of the paper is as follows. After surveying on related work (Section 2), we briefly introduce the overall architecture and the main components of the MuMe dialogue system (see Section 3); we evaluate MuMe by using the IDIAL protocol, and employ MuMe experimentation as a case study for giving feedback on the IDIAL protocol itself (Section 4); finally, in the final Section we briefly recap the main contributions of the paper, and point to ongoing and future work.","We presented the MuMe system, a prototype of a rule-based dialogue system and its evaluation through the IDIAL method. Since the MuMe project is still in development, there is much room for improvement. The most pressing problem to be addressed in future development is the generation of a response more meaningful to the user. The application of a natural language generation pipeline for Italian (e.g. (Mazzei et al., 2016; Mazzei, 2016; Conte et al., 2017; Ghezzi et al., 2018)) could help to these ends.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

That cost has many facets, including training times, storage, replicability, interpretability, equality of access to experimental paradigms, and even environmental impact. In this paper, we review the requirements of a ‘good’ model and argue that a move is needed towards lightweight and interpretable implementations, which promote scientific fairness, paradigmatic diversity, and ultimately foster applications available to all, regardless of financial prosperity. We propose that the community still has much to learn from cognitively-inspired algorithms, which often show extreme efficiency and can ‘run’ on very simple organisms. As a case study, we investigate the fruit fly’s olfactory system as a distributional semantics model. We show that, even in its rawest form, it provides many of the features that we might require from an ideal model of meaning acquisition.","In recent years, the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has seen an increase in the popularity of expensive models requiring enormous computational resources to train and run. The cost of such models is multi-faceted. From the point of view of shaping the scientific community, they create a huge gap between researchers in wealthy institutions and those with less resources and they often make replication prohibitive. From the point of view of applicability, they make the end-user dependent on high-tech hardware which they may not afford, or on cloud services which may have problematic privacy side-effects (and are not available to those with poor Internet access). Training such models can often take a long time and extraordinary amounts of energy, generating CO2 emissions disproportionate to the models’ improvements (Strubell et al., 2019). From a pure modelling point of view, finally, complexity often comes with a loss of interpretability, which weakens theoretical insights. Whilst we appreciate that a part of NLP is focused on engineering applications rather than modelling natural language proper, the linguists and cognitive scientists in the community have a duty to provide transparent, explanatory simulations of particular phenomena. Such considerations call for smaller and more interpretable systems. In this paper, we offer an example investigation into one of the most widely used techniques in NLP: the vectorial representation of word meanings. Our starting point is the set of requirements that should be fulfilled by an ideal model of lexical acquisition, which is expressed in QasemiZadeh et al. (2017): (A) high performance on fundamental lexical tasks, (B) efficiency, (C) low dimensionality for compact storage, (D) amenability to incremental learning, (E) interpretability. As we will show in §2, stateof-the-art systems still fail to integrate all those points. (A-D) are however basic features of humans and animal cognition. It seems, therefore, that we should find inspiration in algorithms from cognitive science, which in turn would allow us to derive interpretability (E) from the clear underpinnings of biological or psychological theories. We propose that a good place to find appropriate algorithms is the natural world, as many organisms display core cognitive abilities such as incremental learning, generalization or classification, which many NLP systems need to emulate. Such faculties develop in extremely simple systems, which are good contenders for the type of models we advocate here. One success story from ‘algorithmic’ cognitive science is based on the neural architecture of the fruit fly’s olfac- tory system, which clusters patterns of chemicals into categories of smells (Stevens, 2015), and has inspired the so-called Fruit Fly Optimization Al- gorithm (Pan, 2011; here: Fruit Fly Algorithm or ‘FFA’). The FFA has been implemented as a lightweight neural algorithm that performs ran- dom indexing for locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) (Dasgupta et al., 2017). This LSH algorithm has successfully been applied to various tasks, partic- ularly in information retrieval and for data com- pression (Andoni and Indyk, 2008). As a simple LSH algorithm, the FFA compresses data while preserving the notion of similarity of the origi- nal data, which is one of the core mechanisms involved in constructing vector representations of word meaning. To our knowledge, it has however never been taken as the basis for building distribu- tional semantic models from scratch, even though it seems to naturally fulfill a number of require- ments of those models. In the following, we present the FFA and show how it can be adapted to create vector spaces of word meaning (§4). We then apply the FFA in an incremental setup (§5) and assess its worth as a model, according to the various criteria high- lighted above (§6), including a possible interpre- tation of the FFA’s output.","We started this paper suggesting that NLP should explore a different class of algorithms for its most fundamental tasks. We argued that it is worth investigating cognitively-inspired architectures, which may not (yet) perform at state-of-theart level, but give us insights into potentially more plausible ways to model linguistic faculties in the mind. We also made a case for ‘small’ and ‘fair’ systems, in reach of all researchers and end-users. As illustration, we have explored what the olfactory system of a fruit fly can do for the representation of word meanings. The algorithm is certainly ‘fair’ in terms of complexity and required resources. Being based on an actual cognitive mechanism, it naturally encodes requirements such as (processing and storage) efficiency. Its simplicity lends itself to incremental learning and interpretability. Performance on a relatedness data set highlights that the raw model successfully captures latent concepts in the data but would probably require an extra attention layer, as indicated by the stronger results obtained on additionally preprocessed data. We hope to have demonstrated that such study is accessible to all, and actually sheds insights into the minimal components of a model in a way that more complex systems do not achieve. We particularly draw attention to the fact that the interesting behaviour of the fruit fly with respect to interpretability and incrementality makes it a worthy competitor for other distributional models – or at the very least, a source of inspiration.",22,Distributional Semantics

In order to obtain this information from free text, several methods involving deep learning have been proposed over the years. In this paper we introduce a Recurrent Neural Network-based method combined with the Self-Interaction Attention Mechanism. Such a method is applied to the DDI2013-Extraction task, a popular challenge concerning the extraction and classification of drug-drug interactions. Our focus is to show its effect over the tendency to predict the majority class and how it differs from the other types of attention mechanisms.","Given the increase of publications regarding side effects, adverse drug reactions and, more in general, how the assumption of drugs can cause risks of health issues that may affect patients, a large quantity of free-text containing crucial information has become available. For doctors and researchers, accessing this information is a very demanding task, given the number and the complexity of such documents. Hence, the automatic extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI), i.e. situations where the simultaneous assumption of drugs can cause adverse drug reactions, is the goal of the DDIExtraction-2013 task (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014). DDIs have to be extracted from a corpus of free-text sentences, combining machine learning with natural language processing (NLP). Starting from the introduction of word embedding techniques like Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) for word representation, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and in particular Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) have become the state-of-the-art technology for most of natural language processing tasks like text classification or relation extraction. The main idea behind the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014) is that the model “pays attention"" only to the parts of the input where the most relevant information is present. In our case, this mechanism assigns a higher weight to the most influential words, i.e. the ones which describe an interaction between drugs. Several attention mechanisms have been proposed in the last few years (Hu, 2018), in particular self-interaction mechanism (Zheng et al., 2018) applies attention with a different weight vector for each word in the sequence, producing a matrix that represents the influence between all word pairs. We consider this information very meaningful, especially in a task like this one where we need to discover connections between pairs of words. In this paper we show how self-interaction attention improves the results in the DDI-2013 task, comparing it to other types of attention mechanisms. Given that this dataset is strongly unbalanced, the main focus of the analysis is how each attention mechanism deals with the tendency to predict the majority class.","We have compared the self-interaction attention model to alternative configurations using the standard attention mechanism introduced by Bahdanau et al. (2014) and the context-attention mechanism of Yang et al. (2016). Our experiments show that the self-interaction mechanism improves the performance with respect to other versions, in particular reducing the tendency of predicting the majority class, hence decreasing the number of false negatives. The standard attention mechanism produces better results than the context attention. As future work, our objective is to exploit or adapt the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which has become quite popular for machine translation tasks and relies almost only on attention mechanisms, and apply it to relation extraction tasks like DDI-2013. Another direction includes the exploitation of a different pre-trained language modeling. For example, BioBERT (Lee et al., 2019) obtains good results for several NLP tasks like Named Entity Recognition or Question Answering and we plan to apply it to our task.",20,In-domain IR and IE

For this purpose, the morphological resources were also ported onto OntoLex-Lemon. We show how the “lemmas” contained in the Wordnet resources can be enriched with morphological features using the lexical representation and linking features of OntoLex-Lemon, which support, among others, the formulation of restrictions in the usage of such expressions. Our work will result in an improved lexical resource combining Wordnet senses and full morphological descriptions in a single ontological framework, as specified in the OntoLex-Lemon model.","WordNets are well-established lexical resources with a wide range of applications. For more than twenty years they have been elaborately set up and maintained by hand, especially the original Princeton WordNet of English (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998). In recent years, there have been increasing activities in which open WordNets for different languages have been automatically extracted from various resources and enriched with lexical semantics information, building the so-called Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) (Bond and Paik, 2012). These WordNets were linked to PWN via shared synset IDs (Bond and Foster, 2013; Bond et al., 2016). The resources in OMW are of different coverage and contain not always the same amount of information, as for example many resources are lacking definitions (or “glosses”), contrary to the PWN resource, or example sentences. The work described in the present article is an extension of previous experiments done with English (Gromann and Declerck, 2019) and more recently with German lexical semantics resource, as we wanted to consider languages with a complex morphology. In the present article we focus on Romance languages, especially Italian. Our current work deals primarily with the morphological enrichment of OMW resources for Italian, i.e. “ItalWordNet.” The first morphological resource we took into consideration for this purpose is an updated version of the MMorph morphological analyser (Petitpierre and Russell, 1995). As a representation mean we chose OntoLex-Lemon (Cimiano et al., 2016), as this model has proven to be able to represent both a classical lexicographic description (McCrae et al., 2017) as well as lexical semantics networks like WordNet (McCrae et al., 2014). OntoLex-Lemon is a further development of the “Lexicon Model for Ontologies” (lemon) (McCrae et al., 2012). Following the Guidelines for mapping Global WordNet formats onto lemon-based RDF, some WordNets have already been mapped onto the former lemon model (McCrae et al., 2014). Our present goal is thus to integrate conceptual descriptions, lemmas and morphological descriptions in the extended ontological framework specified by the OntoLex-Lemon model. In the next sections, we give some background information on OMW and MMorph. We continue with a section on OntoLex-Lemon, followed by sections that describe how OntoLex-Lemon supports the linking of lemmas in the OMW resources to full morphological descriptions. Doing so, morphological descriptions can be associated with the conceptual entries of WordNet.","We described our work on porting Open Multilingual Wordnet resources into the OntoLex-Lemon model, in order to establish an interlinking with corresponding morphological resources, such as the MMorph resource set. For this purpose, the morphological resources were also ported onto OntoLex-Lemon. As a result we noticed that this model can be easily used for bridging the WordNet type of lexical resources to a full description of lexical entries, which could possibly lead to an extension of the coverage of WordNets beyond the consideration of lemmas and PoS information. We documented our interlinking work with the example of the full morphological representation of Italian words, putting them in relation with the corresponding OMW data sets. We also started to investigate the description of usage restrictions, which allows us to state formally that certain Wordnet concepts should be used only in the singular or in the plural form. As a final goal of our work, we see the interlinked or merged resources in the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud. We will investigate how our work can be combined with resources present in the LLOD, especially with the BabelNet framework, which is already integrating a huge number of lexical resources, including Princeton WordNet, and encyclopedic data sets (Ehrmann et al., 2014).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Normally, their performances are benchmarked on well-tailored experimental settings, but what happens with unusual data? In this paper, we present a comparison between popular representation models tested in a non-conventional scenario: assessing action reference similarity between sentences from different domains. The action reference problem is not a trivial task, given that verbs are generally ambiguous and complex to treat in NLP. We set four variants of the same tests to check if different pre-processing may improve models performances. We also compared our results with those obtained in a common benchmark dataset for a similar task.","Verbs are the standard linguistic tool that humans use to refer to actions, and action verbs are very frequent in spoken language (∼50% of total verb occurrences) (Moneglia and Panunzi, 2007). These verbs are generally ambiguous and complex to treat in NLP tasks, because the relation between verbs and action concepts is not one-to-one: e.g. (a) pushing a button is cognitively separated from (b) pushing a table to the corner; action (a) can also be predicated through press, while move can be used for (b) and not vice-versa (Moneglia, 2014). These represent two different pragmatic actions, despite the verb used to describe it and all the possible objects that can undergo the action. Another example could be the ambiguity behind a sentence like John pushes the bottle: is the agent applying a continuous and controlled force to move the object from position A to position B, or is he carelessly shoving an object away from its location? These are just two of the possible interpretations of this sentence as is, without any other lexical information or pragmatic reference. Given these premises, it is clear that the task of automatically classifying sentences referring to actions in a fine-grained way (e.g. push/move vs. push/press) is not trivial at all, and even humans may need extra information (e.g. images, videos) to precisely identify the exact action. One way could be to consider action reference similarity as a Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) problem (Agirre et al., 2012), assessing that lexical semantic information encodes, at a certain level, the action those words are referring to. The simplest way is to make use of pre-computed word embeddings, which are ready to use for computing similarity between words, sentences, and documents. Various models have been presented in the past years that make use of well-known static word embeddings, like word2vec, GloVe, and FastText (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014; Bojanowski et al., 2017). Recently, the best STS models rely on representations obtained from contextual embeddings, such as ELMO, BERT, and XLNet (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). In this paper, we are testing the effectiveness of representation models in a non-conventional scenario, in which we do not have labeled data to train STS systems. Normally, STS is performed on sentence pairs that, on one hand, can have very close or distinct meaning, i.e. the assertion of similarity is easy to formulate; on the other hand, all sentences derive from the same domain, thus they share some syntactic regularities and vocabulary. In our scenario, we are computing STS between textual data from two different resources, IMAGACT and LSMDC16 (described respectively in 5.1 and 5.2), in which the language used is highly different: from the first, synthetic and short captions; from the latter, audio descriptions. The objective is to benchmark word embedding models in the task of estimating the action concept expressed by a sentence.","In this paper we presented a comparison of four popular representation models (one-hot encoding, GloVe, BERT, USE) in the task of semantic textual similarity on a non-conventional scenario: action reference similarity between sentences from different domains. In the future, we would like to extend our Gold Standard dataset, not only in terms of dimension (i.e. more LSMDC16 video-caption pairs annotated with acs from IMAGACT), but also in terms of annotators. It would be interesting to observe to what extent the visual stimuli offered by video prototypes can be interpreted clearly by more than one annotator, and thus calculate the inter-annotator agreement. Moreover, we plan to extend the evaluation to other representation models as well as state-of-the-art supervised models, and see if their performances in canonical tests are confirmed on our scenario. We would also try to augment data used for this test, by exploiting dense video captioning models, i.e. videoBERT (Sun et al., 2019).",1,Language Models
352_2019,2019,65,"Johann Seltmann, Luca Ducceschi, Aurélie Herbelot",How Much Competence Is There in Performance? Assessing the Distributional Hypothesis in Word Bigrams,ENG,3,1,0,"University of Potsdam, Università di Trento",2,1,0,1,Johann Seltmann,0,0,"Germany, Italy","Potsdam, Trento","The field of Distributional Semantics (DS) is built on the ‘distributional hypothesis’, which states that meaning can be recovered from statistical information in observable language. It is however notable that the computations necessary to obtain ‘good’ DS representations are often very involved, implying that if meaning is derivable from linguistic data, it is not directly encoded in it. This prompts questions related to fundamental questions about language acquisition: if we regard text data as linguistic performance, what kind of ‘innate’ mechanisms must operate over that data to reach competence? In other words, how much of semantic acquisition is truly data-driven, and what must be hard-encoded in a system’s architecture? In this paper, we introduce a new methodology to pull those questions apart. We use state-of-the-art computational models to investigate the amount and nature of transformations required to perform particular semantic tasks. We apply that methodology to one of the simplest structures in language: the word bigram, giving insights into the specific contribution of that linguistic component.","The traditional notions of performance and competence come from Chomsky’s work on syntax (Chomsky, 1965), where much emphasis is put on the mental processes underpinning language acquisition. Chomsky posits the existence of a Universal Grammar, innate in the human species, which gets specialised to the particular language of a speaker. By exposure to the imperfect utterances of their community (referred to as performance data), an individual configures their UG to reach some ideal knowledge of that community’s language, thereby reaching competence. The present paper borrows the notions of ‘performance’, ‘competence’ and ‘innateness’ to critically analyse the semantic ‘acquisition’ processes simulated by Distributional Semantics models (DSMs). Our goal is to tease apart how much of their observed competence is due to the performance data they are exposed to, and how much is contributed by ‘innate’ properties of those systems, i.e. by their specific architectures. DSMs come in many shapes. Traditional unsupervised architectures rely on counting co-occurrences of words with other words or documents (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Erk, 2012; Clark, 2012). Their neural counterparts, usually referred to as ‘predictive models’ (Baroni et al., 2014) learn from a language modelling task over raw linguistic data (e.g. Word2Vec, Mikolov et al., 2013, GloVE Pennington et al., 2014). The most recent language embedding models (Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2018), ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), or BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) compute contextualised word representations and sentence representations, yielding state-of-the-art results on sentence-related tasks, including translation. In spite of their differences, all models claim to rely on the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954; Firth, 1957), that is, the idea that distributional patterns of occurrences in language correlate with specific aspects of meaning. The Distributional Hypothesis, as stated in the DSM literature, makes semantic acquisition sound like an extremely data-driven procedure. But we should ask to what extent meaning indeed is to be found in statistical patterns. The question is motivated by the observation that the success of the latest DSMs relies on complex mechanisms being applied to the underlying linguistic data or the task at hand (e.g. attention, self-attention, negative sampling, particular objective functions). Such mechanisms have been shown to apply very significant transformations to the original input data: for instance, the Word2Vec objective function introduces parallelisms in the space that make it perform particularly well on analogy tasks (Gittens et al., 2017). Models such as BERT apply extensive processing to the input through stacks of encoders. So while meaning can be derived from training regimes involving raw data, it is not directly encoded in it. Interestingly, Harris himself (Harris, 1954) points out that a) distributional structure is in no simple relation to the structure of meaning; b) different distributions in language encode different phenomena with various levels of complexity. We take both points as highlighting the complex relation between linguistic structure and the cognitive mechanisms that are necessary to apply to the raw input to retrieve semantic information. The point of our paper is to understand better what is encoded in observable linguistic structures (at the level of raw performance data), and how much distortion of the input needs to be done to acquire meaning (i.e. what cognitive mechanisms are involved in learning semantic competence). In the spirit of Harris, we think it is worth investigating the behaviour of specific components of language and understand which aspects of meaning they encode, and to what extent. The present work illustrates our claim by presenting an exploratory analysis of one of the simplest recoverable structure in corpora: the word bigram. Our methodology is simple: we test the raw distributional behaviour of the constituent over different tasks, comparing it to a state-of-the-art model. We posit that each task embodies a specific aspect of competence. By inspecting the difference in performance between the simplest and more complex models, we get some insight into the way a particular structure (here, the bigram) contributes to the acquisition of specific linguistic faculties. The failures of raw linguistic data to encode a particular competence points at some necessary, ‘innate’ constraint of the acquisition process, which might be encoded in a model’s architecture as well as the specific task that it is required to solve. In what follows, we propose to investigate the behaviour of the bigram with respect to three different levels of semantic competence, corresponding to specific tasks from the DS literature: a) word relatedness; b) sentence relatedness; c) sentence autoencoding (Turney, 2014; Bowman et al., 2016). The first two tasks test to which extent the linguistic structure under consideration encodes topicality: if it does, it should prove able to cluster together similar lexical items, both in isolation and as the constituents of sentences. The third task evaluates the ability of a system to build a sentence representation and from that representation alone, recover the original utterance. That is, it tests distinguishability of representations. Importantly, distinguishability is at odds with the relatedness tasks which favour clusterability. The type of space learned from the raw data will necessarily favour one or the other. Our choice of tasks thus allows us to understand which type of space can be learned from the bigram: we will expand on this in our discussion.","So what can be said about bigrams as distributional structure? They encode a very high level of lexical discrimination while accounting for some basic semantic similarity. They of course also encode minimal sequential information which can be used to retrieve local sentence ordering. Essentially, they result in representations that are perhaps more ‘symbolic’ than continuous. It is important to note that the reasonable correlations obtained on relatedness tasks were achieved after application of PMI weighting, implying that the raw structure requires some minimal preprocessing to generate lexical information. On the back of our results, we can draw a few conclusions with respect to the relation of performance and competence at the level of bigrams. Performance data alone produces very distinct word representations without any further processing. Some traces of lexical semantics are present, but require some hard-encoded preprocessing step in the shape of the PMI function. We conclude from this that as a constituent involved in acquisition, the bigram is mostly a marker of the uniqueness of word meaning. Interestingly, we note that the notion of contrast (words that differ in form differ in meaning) is an early feature of children’s language acquisition (Clark, 1988). The fact that it is encoded in one of the most simple structures in language is perhaps no coincidence. In future work, we plan a more encompassing study of other linguistic components. Crucially, we will also investigate which aspects of state-of-the-art models such as W2V contribute to score improvement on lexical aspects of semantics. We hope to thus gain insights into the specific cognitive processes required to bridge the gap between raw distributional structure as it is found in corpora, and actual speaker competence.",22,Distributional Semantics

We show that, on the GuessWhat?! game, the new module enables the agent to succeed at the game with shorter and hence less error-prone dialogues, despite a slightly decrease in task accuracy. We argue that both dialogue quality and task accuracy are essential features to evaluate dialogue systems.","The development of conversational agents that ground language in visual information is a challenging problem that requires the integration of dialogue management skills with multimodal understanding. A common test-bed to make progress in this area are guessing tasks where two dialogue participants interact with the goal of letting one of them guess a visual target (Das et al., 2017a; de Vries et al., 2017; Das et al., 2017b). We focus on the GuessWhat?! game, which consists in guessing a target object within an image which is visible to both participants. One participant (the Questioner) is tasked with identifying the target object by asking yes-no questions to the other participant (the Oracle), who is the only one who knows the target. Participants are free to go on with the task for as many turns as required. Most models of the Questioner agent in the GuessWhat?! game consist of two disconnected modules, a Question Generator and a Guesser, which are trained independently with Supervised Learning or Reinforcement Learning (de Vries et al., 2017; Strub et al., 2017). In contrast, Shekhar et al. (2019) model these two modules jointly. They show that thanks to its joint architecture, their Questioner model leads to dialogues with higher linguistic quality in terms of richness of the vocabulary and variability of the questions, while reaching a performance similar to the state of the art with Reinforcement Learning. They argue that achieving high task success is not the only criterion by which a visually-grounded conversational agent should be judged. Crucially, the dialogue should be coherent, with no unnatural repetitions nor irrelevant questions. We claim that to achieve this, a conversational agent needs to learn a strategy to decide how to respond at each dialogue turn, based on the dialogue history and the current context. In particular, the Questioner model has to learn when it has gathered enough information and it is therefore ready to guess the target. In this work, we extend the joint Questioner architecture proposed by Shekhar et al. (2019) with a decision-making component that decides whether to ask a follow-up question to identify the target referent, or to stop the conversation to make a guess. Shekhar et al. (2018) had added a similar module to the baseline architecture by de Vries et al. (2017). Here we show that the novel joint architecture by Shekhar et al. (2019) can also be augmented with a decision-making component and that this addition leads to further improvements in the quality of the dialogues. Our extended Questioner agent reaches a task success comparable to Shekhar et al. (2019), but it asks fewer questions, thus significantly reducing the number of games with repetitions.","We have enriched the Questioner agent in the goal-oriented dialogue game GuessWhat?! with a Decision Making (DM) component. Based on the visually grounded dialogue state, our Questioner model learns whether to ask a follow-up question or to stop the conversation to guess the target object. We show that the dialogue produced by our model has less repetitions and less unnecessary questions, thus potentially leading to more efficient and less unnatural interactions – a well-known limitation of current visual dialogue systems. As in Shekhar et al. (2018), where a simple baseline model was extended with a DM component, task accuracy slightly decreases while the quality of the dialogues increases. A first attempt to partially tackle the issue within the GuessWhat?! game was made by Strub et al. (2017), who added a <stop> token to the vocabulary of the question generator module to learn when to stop asking questions using Reinforcement Learning. This is a problematic approach as it requires the QGen to generate probabilities over a non-linguistic token; further, the decision to ask more questions or guess is a binary decision and thus it is not desirable to incorporate it within the large softmax output of the QGen. Jiaping et al. (2018) propose a hierarchical RL-based Questioner model for the GuessWhich image-guessing game introduced by Chattopadhyay et al. (2017) using the VisDial dataset (Das et al., 2017a). The first RL layer is a module that learns to decide when to stop asking questions. We believe that a decision making component for the GuessWhich game is an ill-posed problem. In this game, the Questioner does not see the pool of candidate images while carrying out the dialogue. Hence, it will never know when it has gathered enough information to distinguish the target image from the distractors. In any case, our work shows that a simple approach can be used to augment visually-grounded dialogue systems with a DM without having to use the high complexity of RL paradigms. Task accuracy and dialogue quality are equally important aspects of visually-grounded dialogue systems. It remains to be seen how such systems can reach higher task accuracy while profiting from the better quality that DM-based models produce.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

In the technical domain of cultural heritage and, in particular, archaeology, such an obstacle still exists for the Italian language. This paper presents an effort to fill this gap by collecting linguistic data using existing Collaboratively-Constructed Resources and those on the Web of linked data. The collected data are then used to linguistically enrich the ICCD Archaeological Finds Thesaurus– a monolingual Italian thesaurus. Our terminological resource contains 446 terms with translations in four languages and is publicly available in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) in the Ontolex-Lemon model.","Multilingual domain-specific linguistic resources, such as thematic dictionaries and terminological resources (terminologies further in the text), are knowledge repositories providing information about terms and their semantic relationships in a specific domain and across languages. Currently, most European languages, including Italian, lack terminologies in the field of cultural heritage (Dong, 2017). With cultural heritage one defines the tangible and intangible objects that constitute the culture of each society such as monuments but also songs, traditions, and history (Doerr, 2009). Given the expanding amount of cultural data on the Semantic Web and a plethora of publicly-available resources in various languages as Linked Open Data (LOD), the Web provides solutions for enhancing multilingualism in terminologies (Brugman et al., 2008). Nowadays, many Collaboratively-Constructed Resources (CCRs), or Collaborative Knowledge Bases (CKBs), such as Wiktionary1 and Wikipedia2, are created by decentralized communities of volunteers in different domains. CCRs differ from Linguistic Knowledge Bases (LKBs), such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), which are instead created by experts in specific fields with higher quality control. Some scholars, such as Muller and Gurevych (2008) and Hovy et al. (2013), pointed out several weaknesses of LBKs such as the low coverage of domain-specific vocabulary, restriction to common vocabulary and the difficulty in continuous maintenance resulting in outdated data. Moreover, despite the application of CCRs in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Zesch et al., 2008; Nakayama et al., 2008; Meyer and Gurevych, 2012), processing heterogeneous and often unstructured data linguistically requires syntactic, lexical, and ontological information (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2012; Davies, 2009). This can be efficiently addressed thanks to the current advances in applying computational techniques to the disciplines of the humanities, known as digital humanities (DH), and accessibility of linguistic resources on the Web with movements such as the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) (Chiarcos et al., 2013). Regarding the field of cultural heritage, multilingualism is still a challenge due to the tendency of experts to store terminologies monolingually (Vavliakis et al., 2012). We investigated some online multilingual terminologies such as the Getty Vocabularies3 (Baca and Gill, 2015) which contains thesauri in art, architecture, and cultural objects, iDAI.vocab–the German Archaeological Institute archaeological vocabulary4, the UNESCO Thesaurus5, the European Heritage Network thesauri6 and the Loterre Controlled Vocabulary in art and archaeology7. Among these resources, only the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) by Getty and the iDAI.vocab are exploitable due to a partial domain-specific similarity with our dataset; nevertheless, none of them provide lexicographic descriptions of the terms. In this paper, we propose an approach for semi-automatically creating a multilingual terminology in the technical domain of archaeology and cultural heritage by enriching an existing Italian ontology with linguistic information. Our approach can be applied to any domain and language. Our case study is the archaeological thesaurus provided by the Central Institute for Catalogue and Documentation (ICCD) for describing archaeological finds in Italian (Felicetti et al., 2013). The enriched information is evaluated by annotators, and then converted into the Ontolex-Lemon model in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Our resource provides linguistic information of 446 Italian terms with translations in four languages.","In this paper, we demonstrated the usage of LOD and CCR in enriching terminological ontologies. As a case study, we used an ontology in Italian in the field of cultural heritage and archaeology to create multilingual terminologies. The results of the manual evaluation and implementation process show that leveraging such resources is a valid option for enriching ontologies linguistically. Nonetheless, since CCRs are created by a community effort, a manual verification was carried out for creating gold-standard datasets. Finally, the effort of this study can be framed within the more general context of contributing to the implementation and advancement of the multilingual Web of Data and the LLOD movement. The multilingual resource that we are proposing can be used in several professional figures among which lexicographers, translators, museum and exhibition experts, archaeologists and researchers. Further experiments will concern retrieving MWEs as we have not included them in the current study due to the scarce availability on Wikidata and Wiktionary. MWEs are a topic increasingly handled in NLP, and their processing is fundamental for NLP tasks ranging from POS tagging to Machine Translation to obtain better and more reliable results (Monti et al., 2018). We are also interested in creating gold concepts more efficiently, particularly using topic modelling techniques, and integrating more resources, particularly ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004) which contains many resources such as WordNets and DBpedia.",5,Latin Resources

Embeddings are trained on a manually annotated corpus of texts belonging to the Classical era: different models, architectures and dimensions are tested and evaluated using a novel benchmark for the synonym selection task. A qualitative evaluation is also performed on the embeddings of rare lemmas. In addition, we release vectors pre-trained on the “Opera Maiora” by Thomas Aquinas, thus providing a resource to analyze Latin in a diachronic perspective.","Any study of the ancient world is inextricably bound to empirical sources, be those archaeological relics, artifacts or texts. Most ancient texts are written in dead languages, one of the distinguishing features of which is that both their lexicon and their textual evidence are essentially closed, without any new substantial addition. This finite nature of dead languages, together with the need of empirical data to their study, makes the preservation and the careful analysis of their legacy a core task of the (scientific) community. Although computational and corpus linguistics have mainly focused on building tools and resources for modern languages, there has always been large interest in providing scholars with collections of texts written in dead or historical languages (Berti, 2019). Not by chance, one of the first electronic corpora ever produced is the “Index Thomisticus” (Busa, 1974 1980), the opera omnia of Thomas Aquinas written in Latin in the 13th century. Owing to its wide diachronic span covering more than two millennia, as well as its diatopic distribution across Europe and the Mediterranean, Latin is the most resourced historical language with respect to the availability of textual corpora. Large collections of Latin texts, e.g. the Perseus Digital Library and the corpus of Medieval Italian Latinity ALIM, can now be processed with state-of-the-art computational tools and methods to provide linguistic resources that enable scholars to exploit the empirical evidence provided by such datasets to the fullest. This is particularly promising given that the quality of many textual resources for Latin, carefully built over decades, is high. Recent years have seen the rise of language modeling and feature learning techniques applied to linguistic data, resulting in so-called “word embeddings”, i.e. empirically trained vectors of lexical items in which words occurring in similar linguistic contexts are assigned close vectorial space. The semantic meaningfulness and motivation of word embeddings stems from the basic assumption of distributional semantics, according to which the distributional properties of words mirror their semantic similarities and/or differences, so that words sharing similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. In this paper, we present and evaluate a number of embeddings for Latin built from a manually lemmatized dataset containing texts from the Classical era. In addition, we release embeddings trained on a manually lemmatized corpus of medieval texts to facilitate diachronic analyses. This research is performed in the context of the LiLa: Linking Latin project, which seeks to build a Knowledge Base of linguistic resources for Latin connected via a common vocabulary of knowledge description following the principles of the Linked Data framework. Our contribution provides the community with new resources to be connected in the LiLa Knowledge Base aimed at supporting data-driven socio-cultural studies of the Latin world. The added value of our lemma embeddings for Latin results from the interdisciplinary blending of state-of-the-art methods in computational linguistics with the long tradition of Latin corpora creation: on the one hand the embeddings are evaluated with techniques hitherto applied to modern languages data only, on the other they are built from high quality datasets heavily used by scholars working on Latin.","In this paper we presented a new set of Latin embeddings based on high quality lemmatized corpora and a new benchmark for the synonym selection task. The aligned embeddings can be visually explored through a web interface and all the resources are freely available online: https://embeddings.lila-erc.eu. Several future works are envisaged. For example, we plan to develop new benchmarks, like the analogy test (Mikolov et al., 2013b) or the rare words dataset (Luong et al., 2013), for the intrinsic quantitative evaluation of Latin embeddings. Moreover, embeddings could be used to improve the linking of datasets in the LiLa Knowledge Base. We would also like to extend the diachronic analysis to the embeddings trained on the “Computational Historical Semantics” database as soon as these become available. This work represents the first step towards the development of a new set of resources for the analysis of Latin. This effort is laying the foundations of the first campaign devoted to the evaluation of NLP tools for Latin, EvaLatin.",5,Latin Resources
356_2019,2019,70,Mirko Tavosanis,Valutazione umana di Google Traduttore e DeepL per le traduzioni di testi giornalistici dall’inglese verso l’italiano,ITA,1,0,0,Università di Pisa,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"The contribution presents an evaluation of the performance of Google Translator and DeepL through the web interfaces available to the public. For the evaluation was used a sample of 100 sentences taken from journalistic texts in English translated into Italian. The translations produced were evaluated by humans and the results of the evaluation were compared with the calculation of the BLEU score. The human evaluation of automatic systems showed quality levels close to those of human translation, while the BLEU score did not show close correspondence with human evaluation.","Machine translation systems are playing an increasingly important role in everyday life, either alone or integrated into other practices (Bersani Berselli 2011). Their diffusion could also produce structural innovations and transform in depth some work sectors, beginning with the teaching of foreign languages (Ostler 2010; Tavosanis 2018). However, the assessment of the actual performance of these systems remains a complex problem both from a theoretical and from a practical point of view. Moreover, the difficulty of evaluation has long been considered one of the main constraints also for the development of translation systems (Pieraccini 2012, p. 275; Hajič 2008, p. 85). Numerous automatic or semi-automatic metrics have been developed for the evaluation; the most used in recent times has been BLEU (Papinieni e altri, 2002). The work on metrics is constant and, in particular, to the evaluation of metrics is dedicated one of the shared tasks of the WMT conferences (the results of the most recent are presented in Fourth Conference on Machine Translation 2019, pp. 494-525). However, over the last few years it has become apparent that the most used metrics are not actually able to adequately describe the differences and performance improvements of the latest machine translation systems, and in particular those based on neural networks. The problem can be described in general as a problem of poor correlation between metrics and human judgment. To use as a point of reference human judgment seems to be entirely correct from the methodological point of view: the objective of translation systems is mainly to provide translations that human beings consider to be of a good level. In particular, the non-perfect correlation between BLEU and human judgement has long been noted (e.g. Callison-Burch, Osborne and Koehn 2006) and several evaluators have reiterated the need to consider human evaluation as primary (Callison-Burch and others 2008, p. 72). The situation has probably been made less evident also by the frequent habit of evaluating different systems by comparing performance between them and not on an absolute scale; however, this practice has never been the only one and the systems presented in the main evaluation campaign on machine translation, the WMT tasks, are evaluated only with absolute judgements, not with relative judgements. The problem has been particularly evident in recent years, following the rapid introduction of neural network-based translation systems. BLEU, such as statistical translation systems (PB-SMT), bases its operation on n-grams. However, it is considered that this mechanism shows a bias against systems that adopt translation mechanisms not based on n-grams, such as neural network-based systems (Way 2018, p. 170). Several verifications have shown that in practice BLEU strongly underestimates the results of neural network translation systems (Bentivogli and others 2018a; Shterionov and others 2018). Of course, the validity of these tests can be related to the characteristics of specific samples. However, the data available today justify the idea that BLEU cannot be used as a general indicator of the quality of these systems. In this context there is no shortage of statements claiming the achievement of the ""parity"" between machine translation and human translation for some commercial systems (Hassan and others 2018). However, the independent verifications have not at the moment confirmed these results; on the contrary, they have shown significant differences (Toral and other 2018). Such statements however show the usefulness of an external evaluation of the performance of the most used systems. The present contribution also contributes to this activity, documenting the state of things for widely distributed products and in a context of real use for a language on which evaluations have so far been rather reduced. Some texts generated by automatic translation have therefore been subjected to human evaluation, together with products of human translators, with the aim of: 1. providing a human evaluation of the performance (absolute and non-relative) of two different systems 2. comparing the results of human evaluation with those of the evaluation obtained through BLEU.","The work described here is one of the first realizations of a broader project, dedicated to studying the possibilities of structural integration of automatic translators into the teaching practice of languages starting from the analysis of performance and the possibility of easily integrating products into the path of a translator in training. More extensive evaluations should therefore be available within a few months. For the Italian translation, these evaluations could be of particular interest, considering not only the speed of the recent improvements but also the fact that the Italian has been relatively little represented in the analyses carried out so far. For future developments, having considered a single textual genre, however varied, is a clear limit of analysis (Burchardt and others 2017: 159-160): the extension of the evaluation to different types compared to the newspaper or periodical article could easily lead to results very different from those described here. The inclusion of other textual genres is therefore undoubtedly the most important requirement in the design of an evaluation work on a larger scale. From this point of view, it seems particularly interesting to extend the work to specialist texts.",10,Machine Translation

It contains a comprehensive collection of Alcide De Gasperi’s public documents, 2,762 in total, written or transcribed between 1901 and 1954. The corpus comprises different types of texts, including newspaper articles, propaganda documents, official letters and parliamentary speeches. The corpus is freely available and includes several annotation layers, i.e. key-concepts, lemmas, PoS tags, person names and geo-referenced places, representing a high-quality ‘silver’ annotation. We believe that this resource can foster research in historical corpus analysis, stylometry and computational social science, among others.","In recent years, political scientists and history scholars have started to exploit the availability of digital material to enrich their research, taking advantage of freely accessible online archives and easy-to-use tools for text processing and data extraction. Active communities have been created around topics such as the study of Parliamentary corpora (see the ParlaCLARIN and ParlaFormat workshops), the analysis of political manifestos and of Presidential speeches. Despite the importance of this research field, copyright and availability in machine-readable format still represent major issues, especially in those countries where no or only limited public initiatives have been undertaken to support the distribution of this kind of documents. For example, while in the US the Federal Digital System grants access to public Presidential documents through APIs and bulk-data repositories, in Italy an effort along this line has started only recently with the support of the Archive of the President of the Republic, but has not delivered substantial results so far. This work represents a first attempt to deal with this lack of data, since we present and make available a large corpus of Italian public documents in the political domain. In particular, we release a comprehensive collection of Alcide De Gasperi’s public documents issued between 1901 and 1954, which had been previously published in four volumes by Il Mulino (De Gasperi, 2006; De Gasperi, 2008a; De Gasperi, 2008b; De Gasperi, 2009) but were not machine-readable. Our repository contains all documents in three formats: txt, XML and tab-separated. Raw text files contain only the body of the documents, and may be straightforwardly used to extract embeddings or topics. XML files include metadata that cover not only the title, the date and the place of publication, but also key-concepts automatically extracted from each text and genre labels manually assigned by domain experts. Furthermore, the release includes silver annotation for lemma, part of speech, person names and place names with associated coordinates in a CoNLL-like format. All files and the corresponding descriptions can be downloaded at https://dh.fbk.eu/technologies/corpus-de-gasperi (with CC BY-NC-SA license). The corpus can also be navigated using the ALCIDE platform (Moretti et al., 2016) at this link: http://alcidedigitale.fbk.eu/.","In this paper we present the release of the corpus of Alcide De Gasperi’s public writings, including 2,762 documents and around 3 million tokens. We make available raw texts, XML files having a small set of metadata and key-concepts and CoNLL-like files with lemma, PoS, PER, GPE annotation together with the coordinates of place names. Based on an evaluation performed on all four annotation layers, we show that their quality is good, although annotation was performed automatically and only partially revised. This is the first freely available corpus of this kind, and we hope that it can be used to foster research in political science, corpus linguistics and history, as well as to develop and test NLP systems using data that are different from widely used contemporary news.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Focusing on Italian, we annotated part of the Repubblica Corpus to attempt an automatic classification of the reflexive and impersonal si constructions. In this preliminary study we show that the accuracy of the automatic classification methods that do not use any relevant structural information are rather modest. A thoughtful discussion of the structural analysis required to distinguish among different contexts is provided, in the end suggesting that these structural configurations are not easily recoverable using a purely distributional approach.","The non-triviality of reflexive/impersonal constructions in Italian is exemplified in (1): (1) a. Adai sii presentò. A.i SIi introduced3-SG-PAST ‘A. introduced herself.’ b. Sii/j presentò Adai. SIi/j introduced3-SG-PAST A.i ‘A. introduced herself.’ c. Sii/j presentò ad Adai.

SIgeneric thinks always to saveINF-REFLthe skin ‘We always think about saving our own skin.’ Expecting the co-referential DP to be always “immediately to the left” of the reflexive form quickly leads to wrong predictions: if this generalization might seem sufficient in (1a) this is bluntly wrong in (1b), where we need to assume an empty referent (pro, Rizzi 1986) before the reflexive (see §1.1). Moreover, we should accept that the coreferential DP can be placed sometimes to the right of the predicate (structurally speaking, pro and post-verbal subject options are related, Belletti 2002); in this case, the (focalized/dislocated) post-verbal subject is a good candidate, (1b). Being “the closest DP” is however not a sufficient condition as suggested by the examples (1c-d). Hence, the null subject hypothesis as well as a structural analysis unravelling the role of each DP surrounding the predicate is requested, for the identification of the correct local binding domain (1e-f). Last but not least, a proper classification of the predicate admitting a reflexive or an impersonal pronoun is needed (1g). Under this perspective, we decided to run a little experiment to verify the consistency of a “usage-based” approach (Tomasello 2003) in this specific context and consider whether the “structural analysis” (Chomsky 1995; 2008) can be proved to be an outdated approach for the classification of the distinct kinds of si. In the remaining part of this introduction we will present the (possibly outdated) structural analyses proposed for reflexive (§1.1) and impersonal (§1.2) clitic si. We will then present our experiment consisting of the annotation of a small fragment of the Repubblica Corpus (Baroni et al. 2004) that we used to train and test a set of Machine Learning classification algorithms (§2). Results presentation (§3) and their discussion (§4) will follow.","In this paper, we discussed the nature of some si constructions in Italian, suggesting that, despite their apparent simplicity, their structural intricacies require a deep syntactic analysis for identifying correctly the typology of the clitic in various contexts and retrieve, when necessary, a proper referent. Also using a simplified set of five classes (I = impersonal; L = local immediately preceding coreferential DP; PV = local, immediately post-verbal coreferential DP; LM = local preceding coreferential DP but with prepositional phrase or relative clause modification; A = absent referent), we demonstrated that, using an annotated sample of the Repubblica corpus, no classifier has exceeded the performance of 61.49% of accuracy. This is well below any human reasonable performance (as suggested by the 99% agreement in classification between annotators). These results, even though still based on a small fragment of the Repubblica Corpus, extend Chesi & Moro (2018) original considerations using a wider dataset and more advanced ML algorithms. These results showed that neither the algorithms used nor the extension of the context (both left and right) helped in classifying correctly the instances of “si” when the referent had to be retrieved non-locally or in impersonal “si” cases. Replacing the words with their POS mildly helped in improving the performance of some classifiers (especially using the coarse tagset), with decision tree classifier (J48) obtaining the best performance (on average) across the tests. Given the poor performance of the classifiers tested, we concluded that the “usage-based” intuition is not sufficient here to account for the acquisition of the discriminative capabilities any Italian native speaker owns and that enable her/him to identify correctly the relevant referent both pre- and post-verbally, even in the case of complex subjects (referent DPs modified by prepositional phrases or relative clauses), as well as its unnecessity (in generic/impersonal readings) or its recovery in case of pro-drop. We might expect then that a richer syntactic annotation could help to boost the automatic classification results in accordance with the structural analysis summarized in §1.1 and §1.2: first, a verbal subcategorization specification properly describing the predicate argument structure could be useful, then a correct analysis of the subject phrase structure, including agreement cues should be used, as well as a richer classification of temporal/modal adverbials/modifiers. As suggested by an anonymous reviewer, information structure, which is largely obliterated in written texts, is expected to disambiguate between reflexive and impersonal constructions: for instance, non-dislocated preverbal subjects (L(M) in our classification) should be ruled out in impersonal constructions (see Raposo & Uriagereka 1996); moreover, non-focalized (or right-dislocated) postverbal subjects (PV in our classification) should be ruled out in reflexive constructions. Then, despite the fact that prosody/information structure cannot be assessed within a corpus-based study, we might expect an improvement of the classifiers performance considering some relevant features associated to these configurations: e.g. post-verbal subject annotation in connection with the verbal class and adverbials placement between the subject and verb indicating a dislocated subject. A follow up of this study should test these predictions and, possibly, extend the study to the whole Repubblica corpus, confirming (or disconfirming) our preliminary results that suggest we cannot avoid a deep structural analysis of these constructions to classify (and interpret) them correctly.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We detail the annotation scheme and we present a number of statistical analyses to understand the relation between these multimodal traits and language complexity. We also exploit the corpus to test the validity of existing studies on political orientation and language use, showing that results on our data are not as clear-cut as on English ones.","In the context of a political interview, the host, typically a journalist, acts as a representative of the audience. This means that, if a politician manages to convince or deal with the criticism that the host addresses, then her/his trustworthiness, reliability and credibility will be easily established. In this situation, a politician is judged not only based on one’s arguments and rhetorical choices, but also on the attitude, self-confidence, and in general on an overall convincing behaviour. For example, if a politician seems to be conversationally dominant and manages interruptions to a satisfactory degree, it is more likely that the host, and therefore the audience, will be convinced by the arguments put forward by the interviewee. For this reason, analysing the combination of verbal and non-verbal elements in a political interview could be very interesting for scholars in political science and communication science, and in general to study consensus mechanisms. In this light, we present the first multimodal corpus of political interviews in Italian, and analyze how the combination of verbal and non-verbal elements can shed new light into political agendas and politicians’ attitude. By ‘multimodal’ we mean that the corpus is composed of manual transcriptions of interviews broadcast on TV and annotated with information not only about the linguistic structure of the utterances but also about non-verbal expressions. The corpus, which we call PoliModal, addresses the need to make up for the lack of Italian linguistic resources for political-institutional communication and is annotated in XML following the standard for the transcriptions of speech TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange. In all transcripts, interviewers, interviewees and other guests’ turns have been enriched with the manual annotation of non-lexical and semi-lexical aspects such as breaks, interruptions, false starts, overlaps, interjections, etc. Furthermore, additional linguistic traits related to language complexity, use of pronouns and persons’ mentions have been automatically tagged, enabling an in-depth analysis of speakers’ attitude and communication strategy. In this work we present not only the corpus, which is made freely available at the link https://github.com/dhfbk/InMezzoraDataset, but also an analysis that, combining verbal and non-verbal elements, shows how these traits contribute to making an interview more or less convincing.","In this work, we present PoliModal, the first freely-available multimodal corpus of political interviews, manually annotated with six non-verbal traits. The corpus covers 56 interviews, where each guest is associated with a role (for non politicians) or a political party. We also present a first statistical analysis of the traits and their association with language complexity and with the speakers’ political orientation. In the future, we plan to start from the annotated material not only to extend the corpus, but also to investigate other aspects of political communication. For example, the choice to note non-verbal expressions is motivated by the will to study the strategies of persuasion used by the speakers. According to Poggi (2005), persuasion strategies are multimodal constructs because politicians – specifically in televised political interviews – attempt to persuade their supporters not only by their discursive style and argumentative speech, but also through their personality and their interactional behaviour. In the context of a political interview, persuasion is related to conversational dominance, i.e. a speaker’s tendency to control the other speaker’s conversational actions over the course of an interaction (Itakura, 2001), which is made evident through the kind of non-verbal expressions annotated in our corpus. Finally, since at the moment only one annotator has performed the transcription, segmentation and tagging task, we plan to compute inter-annotator agreement in the near future. The annotation task addressed so far falls – from a qualitative point of view – in the first of the general types identified by (Mathet et al., 2015), in which the subjective interpretation is limited. Indeed, it deals with the “identification of units” (Krippendorff, 2018), in which the annotator, given a written or spoken text, must identify the position and boundary of linguistic elements (e.g. identification of prosodic or gestural units, topic segmentation). We therefore expect agreement to be at least fair, but we plan to measure it using standard metrics.",13,Multimodal

Demonstration of these structures through text analysis can be seen as both a naive effort and a scientific view of the characteristics of the texts. In this study, the textual analysis of Shakespeare plays was carried out for this purpose. Methodologically, we consecutively use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in order to extract topics and then reduce topic distribution over documents into two-dimensional space. The first question asks if there is a genre called Romance between Comedy and Tragedy plays. The second question is, if each character’s speech is taken as a text, whether the dramatic relationship between them can be revealed. Consequently, we find relationships between genres, also verified by literary theory and the main characters follow the antagonisms within the play as the length of speech increases. Although the results of the classification of the side characters in the plays are not always what one would have expected based on the reading of the plays, there are observations on dramatic fiction, which is also verified by literary theory. Tragedies and revenge dramas have different character groupings.","If a road map had to be drawn for Computational Criticism (Moretti, 2013) and subsequent Artificial Literature, it would have certainly considered Elizabethan drama. In particular, Shakespearean texts are the most outstanding examples of dramatic fiction. Demonstration of these structures through text analysis can be seen as both a naive effort and a scientific view of the characteristics of the texts. In this study, the textual analysis of Shakespeare plays was carried out for this purpose. To begin with, 'the First Folio' is the printed material in which all Shakespeare’s works are brought together for the first time, (Synder, 2001). The edition of 1623 was directed by two actors from the group called King’s Men. King’s Men is the ensemble that Shakespeare is also a member of. Half of the 36-play collection had never been published anywhere before. The Folio was also printed in Quarto form. These prints took their names from the way the books were folded. It is known that the First Folio has 800 prints, 233 of them have reached today. In the First Folio, Shakespearean plays are typically divided into three groups: Comedies, Tragedies, and Histories. Romance is the genre that hybridizes Comedy and Tragedy, developed at the beginning of the 17th Century. At the end of his career, he wrote four romances: Pericles, Cymbeline, The Winter’s Tale and The Tempest. 'The First Folio' groups Cymbeline with Tragedies; and The Winter’s Tale and The Tempest together with Comedies. The reason for this may be that The Winter’s Tale and The Tempest began as tragedies and then turned to comedies, and Cymbeline started as a comedy and ended as a tragedy. Shakespeare’s two tragedies Macbeth and Othello are two very good examples of a true tragedy and a revenge tragedy. Tragedies are designed as the struggle of the main characters and the opposing characters who create obstacles for the main character. The protagonist is generally the main character that the audience sympathizes with. Although not sympathetic, Macbeth is a protagonist and the opposing characters are antagonists: Duncan and Banquo. Similarly, there is also antagonism in revenge drama and the main theme is revenge. The antagonist or protagonist seeks revenge for an imaginary or real injury. Iago the antagonist gets his revenge provoking Othello, the protagonist, against his wife. Computerized analysis of literary texts, in other words computational criticism is a new and promising field, (Ramsay, 2011). Pioneering works aim to answer critical questions by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. It is of interest to create fictional texts with the help of computer in the developing artificial literature along with these studies. In this study, we make a computational analysis of Shakespearean texts. There are basically two questions we’re trying to answer. The first is if the genres in Shakespeare’s theater texts can be classified by computer. Secondly, if the sentences in which the characters speak are taken as texts, can antagonisms be revealed? I tried to find answers to both with the same unsupervised learning technique. In recent years, NLP methods have been developing rapidly and text analysis methods are getting more advanced. Topic Modeling articles are among the top cited articles. An unsupervised topic modelling algorithm is used in this study. It is able to generate latent topics in which each document is a mixture. Having the latent topic distribution, by using dimension reduction algorithm, each document is mapped onto two dimensional coordinates without losing intrinsic characteristics.","The classification of genres shows us that the method we use provides successful quantitative information for the differentiation of genres. The length of the texts can be mentioned among the reasons for this success. Positioning the plays between Tragedy and Comedy is much discussed in the literature theory. The Romance genre hybridizes Tragedy and Comedy elements. Instead of mapping the Romance genre in between, the algorithm mapped four 'Problem Plays' in a region between Tragedies and Comedies. Another interesting finding is that Romance cannot be distinguished from Tragedies. The method used shows that the reason for some literary discussion is at the same time quantitative. The method classifies Romances within the Tragedies. In the light of theoretical discussions, of course, there may be a genre called Romance, but we have not been able to quantify this difference yet. There are also some results from our experiments on the two tragedies we have chosen. I intentionally choose a tragedy and a revenge play, although Macbeth clearly shows antagonisms. This is mainly due to the frequency of conversations within these clusters. For example, Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are always aware of each other’s true intentions. Dialogues within these clusters are always compatible with each other. Therefore, the cluster forms. There is a group subjectivity, also verified computationally. The war scene at the end of Macbeth can clearly be observable from the clusters. Two clusters to clash are formed throughout the play, which is quantifiable. On contrary, Iago who hides his true intention from everyone, has apparently always agreed with Othello. On the contrary, Iago never shares his intentions with anyone in the play. His intentions are shared through monologues. Thus, he could not form a cluster. He is a lonely character. That is why, the algorithm fails to find an antagonism. From this point of view, we can say that the method forms clusters of characters that agree with each other. The dramatic structure of revenge plays cannot be revealed by the method we proposed. Our method is successful when finding the clusters. We carried out a similar analysis for the play Hamlet, another type of revenge plays. Hamlet distinguished himself in a different cluster, as a lonely character with Lord Polonius who is responsible for spying on Hamlet. Lord Polonius is a similar character with Iago in terms of hiding their true intentions. The dramatic fiction in Shakespeare’s texts is shown to a certain extent. The advantage of the proposed pipeline is using non-linearity over a linear layer. Instead of directly clustering the document-term matrix, a powerful representation of each document in a feature space is generated by LDA. After generating document-topic matrix, a linear layer of dimension reduction, tSVD, that extracts principal directions or principal axes in which the document-topic matrix have the largest variance. I think that these naive efforts on the way to Artificial Literature also have a positive effect. The production of a play is possible with the knowledge of authorship for humans and even for Shakespeare. By authoring knowledge, we mean, for example, how to write a play from dramatic perspective. It is firstly introduced by Aristotle to shed light on present-day methods. It would be possible to reverse engineering them for artificial literature. Going from a quantitative analysis to plays would be possible. Therefore, as we analyze literary pieces, especially texts in dialogue form can help us verify critical questions and theories. From these analyses, going back to the literary text generation becomes possible.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The increased availability of annotated resources enables the development of statistical approaches specifically for SRL. This holds potential impact in NLP applications. We examine and reproduce Marcheggiani's system and its individual components, including its annotated resources, parser, classification system, the features used and the results obtained by the system. Then, we explore different solutions in order to achieve better results by approaching Verb-Sense Disambiguation (VSD). VSD is a sub-problem of the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem, that tries to identify in which sense a polysemic word is used in a given sentence. Thus a sense inventory for each word (or lemma) must be used. Finally, we also assess the challenges in SRL and identify the opportunities for useful further research in the future.","One of the fields where AI is gaining great importance is NLP. Nowadays, NLP has many applications: search engines (semantic/topic search rather than word matching), automated speech translation, automatic summarization, etc. Therefore, there are many sub-tasks for natural language applications that have already been studied. An example is the syntactic analysis of the words of a sentence. The object of this research study is the realization of a system able to perform SRL. A SRL system does nothing more than take a set of input phrases and, for each of them, it starts to determine the various components that could play a semantic role. A component of a proposition that plays a semantic role is defined as a constituent. Once the possible candidates are determined, Machine Learning techniques are used to label them with the right role. This task becomes important for advanced applications where it is also necessary to process the semantic meaning of a sentence. Moreover, all these applications have to deal with ambiguity. Ambiguity is the term used to describe the fact that a certain expression can be interpreted in more than one way. In NLP, ambiguity is present at several stages in the processing of a text or a sentence, such as: tokenization, sentence-splitting, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, syntactic parsing, and semantic processing. Semantic ambiguity is usually the last to be addressed by NLP systems, and it tends to be one of the hardest to solve among all types of ambiguities mentioned. For this type of ambiguity, the sentence has already been parsed and, even if its syntactic analysis (parse tree) is unique and correct, some words may feature more than one meaning for the grammatical category they were tagged with. Usually, this difference in meaning is associated with syntactic properties. In order to overcome these issues, this research study approaches the VSD task. The majority of the systems used in the VSD task are based on Machine Learning techniques (Witten, 2011). We approach both tasks by following two different solutions.","The realized work represents the development of a complete system for Semantic Role Labeling, an important tool to be used in advanced Natural Language Processing applications. A system of SRL alone is not very useful and it necessarily must be included in a wider application, for example a Question&Answering system or a Neural Machine Translation system. In conclusion, as all the new applications of natural language processing must be able to handle semantic information if they want to have good performances, this type of system can be considered a valuable solution to achieve such performances. The statistical analysis of the errors registered by the system, developing from this analysis new algorithms in order to correct such errors, is another aspect to be considered in the evaluation of this system.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The dataset is automatically built by using a web scraping strategy. We provide a detailed description about the dataset and its generation, and four state-of-the-art approaches for the semantic change point detection are benchmarked by exploiting the Italian Google n-grams corpus.","Computational approaches to the problem of language change have been gaining momentum over the last decade. The availability of long-term and large-scale digital corpora, and the effectiveness of methods for representing words over time, are the prerequisites behind this interest. However, only a few attempts have focused on the evaluation, due to two main issues. First, the amount of data involved limits the possibility to perform a manual evaluation and, secondly, to date no open dataset for diachronic semantic change has been made available. This last issue has roots in the difficulties of building a gold standard for detecting the semantic change of terms in a specific corpus or language. The result is a fragmented set of data and evaluation protocols, since each work in this area has used different evaluation datasets or metrics. This phenomenon can be gauged from (Tahmasebi et al., 2019), where it is possible to count at least twenty different datasets used for the evaluation. In this paper, we describe how to build a dataset for the evaluation of semantic change point detection algorithms. In particular, we adopt a web scraping strategy for extracting information from an online Italian dictionary. The goal of the extraction is to build a list of lemmas with a set of change points for each lemma. The change points are extracted by analysing information about the year in which the lemma with a specific meaning is observed for the first time. Relying on this information, we build a dataset for the Italian language that can be used to evaluate algorithms for semantic change point detection. We provide a case study in which four different approaches are analysed using a unique corpus. The rest of the article is organised as follows: Section 2 describes how our dataset is built, while Section 3 provides details about the approaches under analysis and the evaluation. Finally, Section 4 closes the paper and provides possible future work.","In this paper, we provide details about the construction of a dataset for the evaluation of semantic change point detection algorithms. In particular, our dataset focused on the Italian language and it is built by adopting a web-scraping strategy.

The results prove that the task of detecting semantic shift is challenging due to a large number of detected false positive. As future work, we plan to investigate further methods for building time series and detecting semantic shifts in order to improve the overall performance. Moreover, we plan to fix some issues of our extraction process in order to improve the quality of the dataset itself.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In this paper we present the RiMotivAzione corpus, the first collection of dialogues between physiotherapists and patients recorded in an Italian hospital and annotated following the RIAS annotation protocol. We describe the dataset, the methodologies applied and our first investigations on relevant features of the dialogue process. The corpus was the basis for the design of a conversational interface integrated with a wearable device for rehabilitation, to be used by the patient during the exercises that he or she may perform independently.","In recent years, computational linguistics and medical research have started to collaborate in order to analyze communication in the healthcare domain, particularly between clinicians and patients. From a medical perspective, linguistic analysis and dialogue modeling can be used to better understand and potentially enhance communication in different healthcare settings (Sen et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2013; Marzuki et al., 2017), as well as to identify 'preclinical' or 'presymptomatic' diseases for specific ranges of patients, such as discovering early linguistic signs of cognitive decline (Beltrami et al., 2018). Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies are also used to develop new communicative tools, such as virtual assistants, to alleviate the burden on medical personnel or shift to a home-based, patient-centered model of care. Through mHealth (mobile health), for example, people can receive assistance at home, and monitoring devices can check the well-being of a person (Sezgin et al., 2018). A recent review of scientific literature about Artificial Intelligence and IoT in healthcare can be found in (Shah and Chircu, 2018). The research project RiMotivAzione aims to help patients who have suffered a stroke and are following an arm and hand rehabilitation path. The goal is to motivate the patients to follow the assigned exercises through the use of a new wearable device with motion sensors developed by the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), integrated with a visual app and a conversational interface. This last component guides the user through the therapeutic path, proposing exercises, giving advice, and asking for feedback. The implementation of voice technologies in the healthcare domain allows patients with motor impairments to interact with devices through spoken language (Moore et al., 2018), while their arms and hands are busy performing the assigned exercises. The interaction is seamless and spontaneous. The patient can continue the therapy autonomously, guided by the voice assistant, while the physiotherapist can monitor their progress from a distance, evaluate their performance, and prevent neglect of the therapy. This system helps the patient stay motivated and reach their rehabilitation goals on time. Needless to say, these digital assistants are not meant to substitute the clinician.","We created a corpus of conversations between patients and clinicians, in Italian, and annotated the dialogue turns according to the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). This corpus was the first step in the design of a conversational interface integrated with a smart wearable device to guide and assist patients through the exercises assigned by the physiotherapist. The first step in future work will be to deepen the linguistic analysis conducted on the corpus, especially regarding the tagged dialogue acts. A more in-depth qualitative investigation over the data will be carried out. The second step will be to enrich the dataset: unfortunately, only two patients were deemed appropriate for the experimentation, while a corpus ideally should contain dialogues from more speakers. The RiMotivAzione corpus can be requested from the authors for research purposes. The system prototype will be tested at San Camillo Hospital by a set of stroke patients, following clinical trial procedures. Thanks to the results of the test, we will produce experimental data to investigate if and how a voice assistant integrated with a wearable device can increase the effectiveness of the therapy.",13,Multimodal

Today, Natural Language Processing as well as the widespread use of computerized document writing can give a tremendous boost in reaching the goal of standardizing technical language. In this paper, we propose two methods for standardizing language. These methods have been applied to the dataset of near misses, collected during the inspections at Major-Accident Hazard (MAH) Industries.","Standardizing technical language has always been a strong necessity of the technological society. Artifacts, objects, measures and so on should have a clear name and a clear description in order to assure mutual understanding, which leads to the reach of important goals in building and controlling machines. However, language standardization has always the same problem: language is a social phenomenon (de Saussure, 1916). Hence, whenever a group gathers for designing or using a technical object, this group can develop a specific sub-language or just adapt the shared technical language. This adapted sub-language can then be effectively used to refer to parts of this technical object. It is sufficient that group members agree upon this language and mutual understanding occurs. Yet, the language used by the specific group may prevent others from understanding what is written. Nowadays, Natural Language Processing as well as the widespread use of computerized document writing can give a tremendous boost in reaching the goal of standardizing technical language. Language in use can be captured and then analyzed. Technical people can be invited to use a standardized dictionary with writing suggestions. This paper discusses two different methods of standardizing technical languages, which have been applied to a dataset of near misses coming from the inspections at Major-Accident Hazard (MAH) industries, also known as “Seveso” industries. The first method aims to help a standardization agency to propose the standard language for writing these reports. We proposed to analyze language in use by word embedding similarity, such that the standardization agency can propose a language that is close to the one used. The second method aims to reduce the use of unnecessary synonyms in compiling reports of near misses. In fact, using unnecessary synonyms may result in confusing the report. For this problem, we propose to use a combination of language modeling derived from the CBOW model of word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) along with a classical cosine similarity using word embeddings. We experimented with a dataset of anonymized reports of near misses from Seveso Industries, which INAIL has institutionally collected. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the application scenario and the dataset. Section 3 shortly reports on the models used in this study and proposes the two tasks.

Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions and proposes further investigations.","Standardizing language is a need of our technological society. In this paper, we investigated the possibility of using modern NLP techniques to achieve this goal in the specific scenario of near misses in Seveso Industries. Initial results on the corpus provided by Inail are promising and leave room for further improvement. Future models should include the treatment of multi-word expressions by using compositional distributional semantic models (Zesch et al., 2013; Zanzotto et al., 2015), merge distributional and ontological models, and incorporate a clear model for compensating knowledge producers (Zanzotto, 2019).",20,In-domain IR and IE

It applies a combination of computational linguistics techniques for hate speech detection and data visualization tools on data drawn from Twitter. It allows users to access a vast amount of information through interactive maps, also tuning their view, e.g., visualizing the most viral tweets and interactively reducing the inherent complexity of the data. Educational courses for high school students and citizens have been developed, centered on the platform, and focused on the deconstruction of negative stereotypes against immigrants, Roma, and religious minorities, as well as on the creation of positive narratives.","Hate Speech (HS) is a multi-faceted phenomenon with countless nuances, a high degree of individual and cultural variation, and intersections with related concepts such as offensive language, threats, bullying, and so on. The detection of HS is a recent yet popular task that is gaining the attention of the NLP community but also that of public institutions and private companies. There are several problems connected with this delicate task: a cultural-dependent definition, a highly subjective perception, the need to remove potentially illegal contents quickly from the Web and the connected risk to unjustly remove legal content, the partly overlapping linguistic phenomena that make it hard to identify HS. English social media texts are the most studied, but other languages, sources, and textual genres are investigated as well. “Contro l’odio” is a project for countering and preventing racist discrimination and HS in Italy, in particular focused against immigrants. On the one hand, the project follows and extends the research outcomes emerged from the ‘Italian Hate Map project’ (Musto et al., 2016), whose goal was to identify the most-at-risk areas of the Italian country, that is to say, the areas where the users more frequently publish hate speech, by exploiting semantic analysis and opinion mining techniques. On the other hand, “Contro l’odio” benefits from the availability of annotated corpora for sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and related phenomena such as aggressiveness and offensiveness, to be used for training and tuning the HS detection tools (Sanguinetti et al., 2018; Poletto et al., 2017). The project brings together the competences and active participation of civil society organizations Acmos and Vox, and two academic research groups, respectively from the University of Bari and Turin. This paper focuses on the technological core of the project, a Web platform that combines computational linguistics analysis with visualization techniques, in order to provide users with an interactive interface for exploring the dynamics of the discourse of hate against immigrants in Italian social media. Three typical targets of discrimination related to this topical focus are taken into account, namely Migrants, Muslims, and Roma, since they exemplify discrimination based on nationality, religious beliefs, and ethnicity, respectively. Since November 2018, the platform analyzes daily Twitter posts and exploits temporal and geo-spatial information related to messages in order to ease the summarization of the hate detection outcome.","In this paper we described an online platform for monitoring HS against immigrants in Italy at different levels of granularity, which uses Twitter as a data source and combines HS detection and advanced visualization techniques in order to provide users with an interactive interface for the exploration of the resulted data. Another important research outcome of the project is HATECHECKER, a tool that automatically detects hater users in online social networks, which will be accessible from the platform soon. Given a target user, the workflow that is going to be implemented in our system uses sentiment analysis techniques to identify hate speech posted by the user, and exploits a lexicon-based approach to assign to the person one or more labels that describe the nature of the hate speech she posted (e.g., racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.). A map of Italian projects and associations that spread a culture of tolerance is also under development, to allow ‘Contro l’Odio’ users to get a better understanding of the HS phenomenon and of the active forces fighting it on the Italian territory.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Natural Language Generation techniques can be of great help to journalists, allowing a substantial reduction in the time required to complete repetitive tasks. In this position paper, we enforce the idea that automated tools can reduce the effort required to journalists when writing articles; at the same time we introduce GazelLex (Gazette Lexicalization), a prototype that covers several steps of Natural Language Generation, in order to create soccer articles automatically, using data from Knowledge Graphs, leaving journalists the possibility of refining and editing articles with additional information. We shall present our first results and current limits of the approach, and we shall also describe some lessons learned that might be useful to readers that want to explore this field.","Although automation is a phenomenon that is becoming more and more visible today, there are specialised jobs that require human effort to be completed. The job of a journalist is among these (Örnebring, 2010). However, recent technological progress in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) and the use of increasingly sophisticated techniques of artificial intelligence allow the use of software capable of writing newspaper articles almost indistinguishable from human ones. These techniques can help journalists reduce the effort needed for repetitive tasks, such as data collection and drafting writing. The name given to this phenomenon is Automated Journalism; this new type of journalism uses algorithms to generate news under human supervision. During the past years, several newsrooms have begun to experiment this technology: Associated Press, Forbes, Los Angeles Times, and ProPublica are among the first, but adoption could spread out soon (Graefe, 2016). Automated Journalism can bring a massive change to the sector: writing news is a business that endeavours to minimise costs while maintaining maximum efficiency and full speed, and thanks to this software the above-mentioned objectives can be achieved, generating good-quality articles (van Dalen, 2012). This new technology provides many advantages: the most evident are speed and the scale of news coverage. Of course, there are also problems and limitations. One of the most relevant is the dependence from structured data (Graefe, 2016), that is the reason why sports reports, financial articles, and forecasts are the most covered topics by software: they are all domains where the complexity of the topic can be managed from software using structured data. Similar structured data are not always available in other fields. In order to generate valuable text, approaches considering data contained in the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have recently been introduced in literature (Gardent et al., 2017; Trisedya et al., 2018). A Knowledge Graph (KG) describes real-world entities and the relations between them. KGs are an essential source of information, and their features allow the use of this information in different contexts, such as link prediction (Trouillon et al., 2016) and recommendation (Zhang et al., 2016). Popular KGs are the Google Knowledge Graph, Wikidata and DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007). Entities are defined in an ontology and thus can be classified using a series of types. The primary element of a KG to store entities information is a Resource Description Framework (RDF) triple in the format hsubject; predicate; objecti. As RDF triples open many possibilities in Web data representation, utilising this data also in the NLG context is valuable (Perera et al., 2016). Interlinked KGs can be used to automatically extend the information relating to a given entity in an article. In our solution, we use DBpedia, one of the fastest growing Linked Data resources that is available free of charge; it is characterised by a high number of links from the Linked Data Cloud. DBpedia is thus a central interlinking hub, an access point for retrieving information to be inserted in an article, as specified below. Up to 2010, commercial providers in the NLG field were not popular, but in the last years few companies have started to provide this kind of services. In 2016 there were 13 companies covering this field (Drr, 2016) (e.g., AutomatedInsights, NarrativeScience). Approaches that try to integrate deep networks and text generation are now common in literature (Gardent et al., 2017). These automated tools are going to become a standard method to help journalists during the news writing process. We shall concentrate on examples of related work in the context of lexicalization from RDF data, we shall refer to surveys from the state of the art for a more detailed overview of the field (Reiter and Dale, 1997; Gatt and Krahmer, 2018; Moussallem et al., 2018). Semantic web technologies like RDF can be used to enhance the power of current algorithms (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2012). The WebNLG challenge (Gardent et al., 2017) has been introduced to study the possibilities given by the combination of deep learning techniques and semantic web technologies. In a similar context, an approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks has been proposed to generate text lexicalizations from RDF triples (Trisedya et al., 2018). In this work, we aim to describe what is the possible automation process that can be used to help journalists in the news writing process. At the same time we describe a new prototype we have created to support journalistic activities, GazelLex (Gazette Lexicalization). GazelLex, through the use of deep learning techniques implements a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) approach to generate articles (sentences) starting from data composed by RDF triples. GazelLex is also able to generate videos containing the images and the prominent information of the article, and to generate audio using a speech synthesis module (Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, our prototype is the first to provide an all-in-one integrated approach to NLG with RDF triples in the context of helping journalists in writing articles. This paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we analyse the state-of-the-art on Natural Language Generation, showing that these methods to generate natural language are becoming popular. In Section 3 we describe our prototype, GazelLex, that combines neural methods and knowledge graphs to create soccer articles and describe how this kind of tools can be of help to journalism. In Section 4 we show a preliminary experimental analysis, while in Section 5 we provide conclusions.","In this position paper we have analysed the future possibilities given by automated journalism. We have summarised the current state of art on this topic showing that there is an increasing interest towards automated natural language generation for the news sector. While hereby, we showed an application related to the soccer domain, the principles and the methodologies described are general, and they can be used in other fields (e.g., finance, weather reporting). We strongly believe that these tools can greatly help journalists in working on what is really important (e.g., investigation, fact checking), leaving high effort, but low value tasks to computers. The prototype we have described is a first step towards this automated process and its results are surely promising.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Unfortunately, the requirements of neural QA systems are very strict in the size of the involved training datasets. Recent works show that the application of Automatic Machine Translation is an enabling factor for the acquisition of large-scale QA training sets in resource-poor languages such as Italian. In this work, we show how these resources can be used to train a state-of-the-art deep architecture, based on effective techniques recently proposed within the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) paradigm.","Question Answering (QA) (Hirschman and Gaizauskas, 2001) tackles the problem of returning one or more answers to a question posed by a user in natural language, using as a source a large knowledge base or, even more often, a large-scale text collection: in this setting, the answers correspond to sentences (or their fragments) stored in the text collection. A typical QA process consists of three main steps: the question processing that aims at extracting requirements and objectives of the user’s query, the retrieval phase where documents and sentences that include the answers are retrieved from the text collection, and the answer extraction phase that locates the answer within the candidate sentences (Harabagiu et al., 2000; Kwok et al., 2001). Various QA architectures have been proposed so far. Some of these rely on structured resources, such as Freebase, while others use unstructured information from sources such as Wikipedia (an example of such a system is Microsoft's AskMSR (Brill et al., 2002)), or generic Web pages, e.g., the QuASE system (Sun et al., 2015). Hybrid models exist as well, that make use of both structured and unstructured information. These include IBM’s DeepQA (Ferrucci et al., 2010) and YodaQA (Baudiš and Šedivý, 2015). In order to initialize such systems, a manually constructed and annotated dataset is crucial, from which the mapping between questions and answers can be learned. Datasets designed for structured-knowledge based systems, such as WebQuestions (Berant et al., 2013), usually contain the questions, their logical forms, and the answers. On the other side, datasets over unstructured information are usually composed of question-answer pairs: WikiMovies (Miller et al., 2016) is an example of this class of systems and it is made of a collection of texts from the movie domain. Finally, some datasets contain the entire triplets made of the questions, the paragraphs, and the answers, that are expressed as specific spans of the paragraph and thus located in the paragraph. This is the case of the recently proposed SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). State-of-the-art approaches proposed in literature (Chen et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al., 2018) are based on neural paradigms and are often portable across different languages. Among them, the neural approach presented in (Devlin et al., 2019), beside achieving state-of-the-art results in several NLP tasks, is shown competitive in QA even with respect to human annotators. Unfortunately, the limited availability of training data for languages different from English still remains an important problem. Even though multilingual data collections, such as Wikipedia, do exist for many languages, the portability of the corresponding annotated resources for supervised learning algorithms remains limited: large-scale annotated data mostly exist only for the English language. Recent works show that the application of Automatic Machine Translation enables the acquisition of large corpora for QA in resource poor languages such as Italian (Croce et al., 2018; Croce et al., 2019). As a result, SQuAD-IT, i.e., a large scale dataset made of about 50,000 questions/answer pairs has been made available. It was not fully manually validated but still represents a valuable resource for training neural approaches. In this work, we show how these resources enable the training of a recent and promising deep neural architecture, based on the effective techniques recently justified within the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) paradigm (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019). The experimental evaluation carried out with respect to SQuAD-IT confirm the impressive results of BERT even in Italian QA, providing state-of-the-art results which are far higher with respect to previous methods. In the rest of the paper, section 2 introduces the BERT architecture for QA. Section 3 reports the experimental evaluation, while Section 4 draws some conclusions.","This paper explores the application of Bidirectional Encoder Representations within the QA task in Italian, enabled by the recent availability of a large-scale annotated corpus, SQuAD-IT. The experimental results confirm the robustness of the adopted Transformer-based architecture, with a significant improvement with respect to earlier neural architectures. This result paves the way to the development of portable, robust, and accurate neural models for QA in Italian, and future work will certainly consider other possible extensions of the adopted model.",1,Language Models

We propose a theoretical architecture in which the psychological model above is translated into a probabilistic predictor and then integrated in the reinforcement learning process, intended in its partially observable variant. The experimental validation of the architecture proposed is currently ongoing.","A typical conversational agent has a multi-stage architecture: spoken language, written language, and dialogue management, see Allen et al. (2001). This study focuses on dialogue management for task-oriented conversational agents. In particular, we focus on the creation of a dialogue manager aimed at inducing healthier nutritional habits in the interactant. Given that the task considered involves psychosocial aspects that are difficult to program directly, the idea of achieving an effective dialogue manager via machine learning techniques, reinforcement learning (RL) in particular, may seem attractive. At present, many RL-based approaches involve training an agent end-to-end from a dataset of recorded dialogues, see for instance Liu (2018). However, the chance of obtaining significant results in this way entails substantial efforts in both collecting sample data and performing experiments. Worse yet, such efforts ought to rely on the even stronger hypothesis that the RL agent would be able to elicit psychosocial aspects on its own. As an alternative, in this study we envisage the possibility to enhance the RL process by harnessing a model developed and accepted in the field of social psychology to provide a more reliable learning ground and a substantial accelerator for the process itself. Our study relies on a quantitative, causal model of human behavior being studied in the field of social psychology (see Carfora et al., 2019) aimed at assessing the effectiveness of message framing to induce healthier nutritional habits. The goal of the model is to assess whether messages with different frames can be differentially persuasive according to the users’ psychosocial characteristics.","In this work we explored the possibility of harnessing a complete and experimentally assessed SEM, developed in the field of persuasion psychology, as the basis for the reinforcement learning of a dialogue manager that drives a conversational agent whose task is inducing healthier nutritional habits in the interactant. The fundamental component of the method proposed is a DBN, which is derived from the SEM above and acts like a predictor for the belief state value in a POMDP. The main expected advantage is that, by doing so, the RL agent will not need a time-consuming period of training, possibly requiring the involvement of human interactants, but can be trained ‘in house’ – at least at the beginning – and be released in production at a later stage, once a first effective strategy has been achieved through the DBN. Such method still requires an experimental validation, which is the current objective of our working group.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

We provide the resource together with a Neo4j plugin to enable efficient searching and querying over such large graph. We use WebIsAGraph to study the problem of detecting polysemous terms in a noisy terminological knowledge graph, thus quantifying the degree of polysemy of terms found in is-a extractions from Web text.","Acquiring concept hierarchies, i.e., taxonomies from text, is a long-standing problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Much previous work leveraged lexico-syntactic patterns, which can be either manually defined (Hearst, 1992) or automatically learned (Shwartz et al., 2016). Pattern-based methods were shown by (Roller et al., 2018) to outperform distributional methods, and can be complemented with state-of-the-art meaning representations such as hyperbolic embeddings (Nickel and Kiela, 2017) to infer missing is-a relations and filter wrong extractions (Le et al., 2019). Complementary to these efforts, researchers looked at ways to scale hypernymy detection to very large, i.e., Web-scale corpora (Wu et al., 2012). Recently, (Seitner et al., 2016) applied Hearst patterns to the CommonCrawl1 to produce the WebIsaDb. Using Web corpora makes it possible to produce hundreds of millions of isa triples: the extractions, however, include many false positives and cycles (Ristoski et al., 2017). Methods for hypernym detection like, e.g., pattern-based approaches, have a limitation in that they do not necessarily produce proper taxonomies (Camacho-Collados, 2017): automatically detected is-a relationships, on the other hand, can be used as input to taxonomy induction algorithms (Velardi et al., 2013; Faralli et al., 2017; Faralli et al., 2018, inter alia). These algorithms rely on the topology of the input graph, and, therefore, cannot be applied ‘as-is’ to Web-scale resources like WebIsaDb, since this resource merely consists of a set of triples. Moreover, WebIsADb does not contain fully semantified triples, i.e., subjects and objects of the is-a relationships consist of potentially ambiguous terminological nodes. This is because, due to their large size, source input corpora like the CommonCrawl cannot be semantified upfront. Linking to the semantic vocabulary of a reference resource like DBpedia (Hertling and Paulheim, 2017) also barely mitigate this problem, since Wikipedia-centric knowledge bases have not, and cannot be expected to have, complete coverage over Web data (Lin et al., 2012). In this paper, we present an initial solution to these problems by building the first very large hypernymy graph, dubbed WebIsAGraph, built from is-a relationships extracted from a Web-scale corpus. This is a relevant task: although WordNet (and other thesauri) already provides a catalog of ambiguous terms, many nodes of WebIsAGraph are not covered in available lexicographic resources, because they are proper names, technical terms, or polysemantic words. Our graph – which we make freely available to the research community to foster further work on Web-scale knowledge acquisition – is built from the WebIsADb on top of state-of-the-art graph mining tools2: thanks to an accompanying plugin, it can be easily searched, queried, and explored. WebIsAGraph may represent an opportunity to researchers for investigating approaches to a variety of tasks on large automatically acquired term tuples. As an example, we use our resource to investigate the problem of identifying ambiguous terminological nodes. To automatically detect whether a lexicographic node is ambiguous or not, we use information from both the graph (topological features) and textual labels (word embeddings) as features to train a model using supervised learning. Our results provide a first estimate of the degree of polysemy that can be found among is-a relationships from the Web.","The main contribution of this work is the creation of a new resource by converting a large dataset of is-a (hypernymy) relations, automatically extracted from the Web (such as WebIsADb), into a graph structure. This graph, along with its accompanying search tools, enables both descriptive and predictive analytics of emerging properties of terminological nodes. In this paper, we used our new resource to investigate whether a node's polysemy can be predicted from its topological features (i.e., connectivity patterns) and textual features (meaning representations derived from word embeddings). The results of this preliminary study suggest that textual features are strong predictors of polysemy, while topological features appear to be weaker predictors, although they do show a significant correlation with the polysemy of the related node.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Evidence from Synchronic and Diachronic Language Resources,ENG,1,1,1,Università di Bari Aldo Moro,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Bari,"The aim of this paper is to discuss the results of a corpus-based investigation of the process that has transformed the very specific material meaning of the word “culture” into the extremely elusive, liquid AUTHOR concept we are familiar with today. The analysis starts from the lexicogrammar profile of the world “culture” in contemporary syncronic corpus resources AUTHOR and attempts further exploration of these findings on the basis of diachronic language resources. In particular, data from Google Books, accessed both via Ngram Viewer and through the tools available at BYU Corpora, have been used to test hypotheses for the behaviour of the world “culture” in the 19th and early 20th century, whereas data from EEBO (Early English Books Online) have been used to explore patterns of usage in the period of time from 15th to 18th century. The partial results of this research suggest that there is room for far reaching investigations into the (hi)story of this intriguing “complicated"" word, as AUTHOR dubbed it, and that computational methods and language resources can well complement studies carried out in the context of the digital humanities, from the perspective of historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and cultural studies, when not providing the basis for fresh new insights and further explorations.","Sketching the “historical peregrinations” of the concept of culture in his Culture in a Liquid Modern World, Bauman outlines the changing role of culture in society, from “an agent for change”, to “a conservative force”, to an increasingly flexible and liquid concept “fashioned to fit individual freedom” AUTHOR. It is against this background that this paper attempts an investigation of the multifaceted process that over the centuries has transformed the very specific material meaning of the word “culture” into the extremely elusive concept we are familiar with today. The basic assumption is that the process of semantic change which transformed a word originally referring to the concepts of tillage and husbandry (from the Latin colere) into a potentially polysemic word accommodating a far wider range of meanings is mirrored in changes in usage of the word, and in turn reflects changes in society. In the wake of a growing interest for the use of language resources for the investigation of cultural and social phenomena (e.g. AUTHOR) these changes can be observed through the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the lexicogrammar patterns the word “culture” has entered during its long history of existence. The very choice for the word “culture” originates in Raymond Williams’ famous statement that culture is “one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language”. By identifying “culture” as one of the key words of our times, Williams reminds us AUTHOR that culture used to be, in its early uses, the noun of a process: the tending of something, basically crops or animals. This meaning provided a basis for the important next stage of metaphorization, when the tending of natural growth was extended to a process of human development so that the word “culture” came to be taken in absolute terms as signifying a process of refinement. After tracing the key moments in the development of this word, Williams distinguishes three categories in modern usage: (i) the noun which describes a process of intellectual, spiritual and aesthetic refinement; e.g. a man of culture; (ii) the noun which describes the products of intellectual and especially artistic activity; e.g. Ministry of Culture; (iii) the noun which indicates a particular way of life, whether of a people, a period, a group, or humanity in general; e.g. Jewish culture. This paper takes Williams as a starting point to provide empirical evidence of the ways the word “culture” is used in the English language. Indeed Williams himself, in his introduction to Culture and Society, states that an enquiry into the development of this word should be carried out by examining “not a series of abstracted problems, but a series of statements by individuals” AUTHOR, which bears striking similarities – though not intended with the corpus-based approach adopted in the present research.","Using different resources to map such a complex research field, so as to obtain a general picture of significant patterns of usage in the evolution of language is certainly fascinating, but this is not enough. And it goes without saying that it is necessary to be extremely cautious before drawing conclusions, if any, from investigations like these. Anyway, the data analyzed confirm that that there are resources and tools that can support the investigation of huge amount of data, pointing to interesting research areas to be analyzed with more refined ad hoc tools. In any case a rewarding exploration of these data from a cultural perspective can perhaps only come as the result of teamwork in the context of a multidisciplinary approach in the growing research field of the Digital Humanities.",5,Latin Resources

Since the utterances used during the interaction with a CoRS may be different depending on the domain of the items, the system should also be trained separately for each domain. So far, there are no publicly available datasets based on real dialogues for training the components of a CoRS. In this paper, we propose three datasets that are useful for training a CoRS in the movie, book, and music domains. These datasets have been collected during a user study for evaluating a CoRS. They can be used to train several components, such as the Intent Recognizer, Entity Recognizer, and Sentiment Recognizer.","Recommender Systems (RS) are software systems that help people make better decisions AUTHOR. They have become a fundamental tool for overcoming the information overloading problem, which is caused by the ever-increasing variety of information and products that people can access AUTHOR. Choosing between such a large quantity of options is not easy, and this results in a decrease in the quality of the decisions. Recommender systems help alleviate the problem by providing personalized suggestions to users, based on their preferences. Conversational Recommender Systems (CoRS) are a particular type of Recommender Systems, that acquire the user’s profile in an interactive manner AUTHOR. This means that, in order to receive a recommendation, the system does not require that all the information is provided beforehand, but it guides the user in an interactive, human-like dialog AUTHOR. Even though a CoRS can be implemented using several different interfaces, it is reasonable to think that an interaction based on natural language is suitable for the task. In particular, Digital Assistants (DA) such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple’s Siri are interesting platforms to deliver recommendations in a conversational manner. DAs, popularized with the diffusion of smartphones, are able to help users complete everyday tasks through a conversation in natural language. However, there is still a technological gap between CoRSs and DAs, as described in AUTHOR. In particular, one of the main causes of that gap is the lack of labeled data. In fact, implementing a natural language-based interface for a CoRS is not easy, as it requires the use of several Natural Language Understanding (NLU) operations. For example, a basic conversational recommender needs at least three NLU components: an Intent Recognizer, an Entity Recognizer, and a Sentiment Analyzer. These components need to be trained on large quantities of real sentences, which may not always be available. The problem is worsened by the fact that each component may need to be trained separately for each different domain. In this paper, we present three datasets that contain utterances used in real dialogues between users and a CoRS respectively in the movie, book, and music domains. These datasets can then be used to train the components of a new CoRS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a dataset of real dialogues is provided for the book and music domains, while there is already one example for the movie domain AUTHOR. The dataset is available at the following link1 . Section 2 contains a literature review of datasets for training Question Answering and Conversational Recommender Systems. Section 3 illustrates the architecture of the CoRS that was used to collect the messages in the dataset. Section 4 describes in detail the three datasets, providing some statistics, and a small example of conversation.","In this paper, we presented three datasets that contain real user messages sent to Conversational Recommender Systems in the movie, book, and music domains. The datasets can be used to train a new CoRS to detect the intents, and with a few modifications, also to recognize entities and sentiments. The size of the data that we provide may not be sufficient to train deep learning-based End-to-End conversational recommendation models. However, this is outside the scope of our work: as stated in the previous sections, the aim of our datasets is to learn a conversational recommendation dialog model, independently from the actual recommendation algorithm. In any case, we believe that this is the first time that a dataset for training CoRSs in the book and music domain is released. Also, we believe that this is a good starting point for the release of further conversational datasets in multiple domains. We propose, as future work, to expand the datasets, by collecting more messages, in more domains. We will also explore the possibility to use our datasets to evaluate new CoRSs.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

For this work we built a dataset consisting of more than 2.400.000 posts extracted from publicly available forums and containing authorship attribution metadata, such as age and gender. We developed an age classifier and performed a set of experiments with the aim of evaluating the possibility of assigning the correct age of an user and which information is useful to tackle this task: lexical or linguistic information spanning across different levels of linguistic descriptions. The performed experiments show the importance of lexical information in age classification, but also that exists writing style that relates to the age of an user.","Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and public forums allow users to communicate and share their opinions and to build social relations. The proliferation of such platforms allowed the scientific community to study many communication phenomena such as the analysis of the sentiment AUTHOR or irony AUTHOR. Another related research field is the ”author profiling” one, where the features that allow to discriminate age, gender, or native language of a person are analyzed. These studies are conducted both for forensic and marketing reasons, since the classification of these characteristics allow companies to better focus their marketing campaigns. In the author profiling scenario, many are the studies conducted by the scientific community, that were generally focused on English and Spanish language. The majority of these studies were performed in PAN 1 AUTHOR, a lab at CLEF 2 that holds each year and in which many shared tasks related to the ”authorship attribution” research topic are run. In these shared tasks participants were asked to identify the gender or the age using manually annotated training data from social media platforms. Among the most successful approaches proposed by participants the ones that achieved the best results (AUTHOR, AUTHOR) are based on SVM classifiers exploiting a wide variety of lexical and linguistic features, such as word n–grams, part–of–speech, and syntax. Only recently deep learning based approaches were proposed and have showed very good results especially when dealing with multi–modal data, i.e. text and images posted on Twitter AUTHOR. In the present work we tackle a specific authorship attribution task: the age detection for the Italian language. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such task is performed on Italian. For this reason, we built a multi–topic corpus, developed a classifier which exploits a wide range of linguistic features, and conducted several experiments to evaluate both the newly introduced corpus and the classifier. The main contributions of this work are: i) an automatically built corpus for the age detection task for the Italian language; ii) the development of an age detection system; iii) the study of the impact of linguistic and lexical features.","We presented the first automatically built corpus for the age detection task for the Italian language. By exploiting the publicly available information on the FreeForum platform, we built a corpus consisting of more than 2.400.000 posts and 7.000 different users containing the user’s age information. The first experiments performed through a machine learning based classifier that uses a wide range of linguistic features showed promising results in two different range classification tasks both in the in–domain and out–domain settings. The conducted experiments show that lexicon plays a fundamental role in the age classification task both in in–domain and out–domain scenarios. Lastly, the experiments shown that the corpus, even though if automatically generated, is suitable for real–world applications. We plan to release the full corpus as soon as privacy and legal issues will be fully investigated.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

However, such techniques are still facing challenges; one of them is related to the limited availability of annotated text data. In this perspective, with a multi-task approach, simultaneously training different related tasks enables multi-task models to learn common features among different tasks where they share some layers with each other. It is desirable to used stacked long-short term memories (LSTMs) in such models to deal with a large amount of training data and to learn the underlying hidden structure in the data. However, the stacked LSTMs approach also leads to the vanishing gradient problem. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a multi-task model based on convolution neural networks, stacked LSTMs, and conditional random fields and use embedding information at different layers. The model proposed shows results comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we performed an empirical analysis of the proposed model with different variations to see their impact on our model.","Named entity recognition (NER) consists in recognizing chunks of text and labelling them with predefined categories (e.g., person name, organization, location, etc). NER is an information extraction task and has many applications for instance in co-reference resolution, question answering systems, machine translation, information retrieval etc (Chieu and Ng, 2002). NER is also performed on biomedical data where it involves recognizing biomedical concepts (e.g., cell, chemical, drug, disease, etc) and classifying them into predetermined categories. This is referred as biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER). Large amounts of medical data are available as free, unstructured text and the quantity of annually generated biomedical data like books, scientific papers, and other publications makes it challenging for physicians to stay up to date. Moreover, biomedical documents are more complex than normal texts and the names of the entities show peculiar characteristics. Long multi-word expressions (10-ethyl-5-methyl-5,10dideazaaminopterin), ambiguous words (TNF alpha can be used for both DNA and Protein) (Gridach, 2017), spelling alternations (e.g., 10Ethyl-5-methyl-5,10-dideazaaminopterin vs. 10EMDDA) make the BioNER task even more challenging (Giorgi and Bader, 2018). BioNER is also an important preliminary task for other tasks like the extraction of relations between entities (e.g., chemical induced disease relation, drug-drug interaction, . . . ). Recent applications of deep learning in BioNER minimize manual feature engineering process and at the same time produce promising results. Deep learning is now the state-of-the-art technique but, due to the complex structure of biomedical text data, deep learning models have difficulties in performing efficiently. Moreover, these systems require large amounts of input data while the available annotated biomedical data are not enough to train these systems effectively. Manually generating annotated biomedical text data is an expensive and time-consuming job. In order to address this limitation, one solution is to take advantage of a multi-task learning approach. Multi-task learning (MTL) involves training simultaneously different but related tasks together. Such an approach has shown significant improvements in different fields. In this paper, we propose a multi-task model (MTM-CW) using convolutional neural networks (CNN) (dos Santos and Guimarães, 2015), stacked layers of Bidirectional long-short term memories (BiLSTM), and conditional random fields (CRFs). Furthermore, we have conducted an empirical analysis of the impact of different word input representation to our model. The rest of the paper is organized as follows; Section 2 gives a brief background of the multitask learning followed by Section 3 where our multi-task model (MTM-CW) is discussed. Experimental setup is presented in Section 4 which is followed by the results and discussion (Section 5). Section 6 concludes and presents possible future research directions.","In this paper we showed that the BioNER performance can be drastically improved by using a multi-task approach. We showed that using stacked LSTMs in such models are effective to learn hidden structure of the data. Moreover, to overcome the vanishing gradient problem in using stacked LSTMs is addressed by passing embedding information layers to layers. We showed that our model outperforms in F1-score compared to the state-of-the-art models. For future work, we will extend the multi-task approach for relation extraction task. In such approach, BioNER can be used as an auxiliary task while keeping relation extraction task as the main task in the multi-task approach.",1,Language Models

Our results are comparable to those of (Peldszus and Stede, 2015), which proves that their model is applicable successfully to languages other than English and German.","In recent years, argumentation mining (Lippi and Torroni, 2016) has become an area of big interest in the field of natural language processing. Argumentation mining seeks to automatically recognize the structure of the argumentation in a text by identifying, classifying and connecting the central claim of a text, supporting premises, possible objections and counter-objection. Argumentation mining has many possible applications in very different fields. Recognizing automatically the argumentative structure of a text can be useful as an extension of opinion mining, in retrieval of court decisions from databases (Palau and Moens, 2011), in automatic document summarization (Teufel and Moens, 2002), in analysis of scientific papers as in biomedical text mining (Teufel, 2010; Liakata et al., 2012) in essay scoring, and more. This task can be decomposed into several subtasks: segmentation of the text in elementary discourse units (EDUs), identification of argumentative discourse units (ADUs), classification of argumentative discourse units, identification of the relations between argumentative discourse units and classification of these relations. The argumentation structure of a text can be presented as a tree structure, with a node for each argumentative discourse unit and different edges between nodes representing the different types of relations. There are many simple models that recognize automatically the argumentation structure of a micro-text. Our starting point is the model by (Peldszus and Stede, 2015), who developed a software to automatically mine the argumentation structure of short texts for English and German. In this paper we perform argumentation mining on a corpus of short Italian argumentative texts. To transfer the approach to Italian, we assembled a suitable corpus by semi-automatically translating the original German corpus and we adapted the features used by the software, by assembling a list of Italian connectives necessary to fulfill the task. Our results are slightly lower than the ones for German and English, but they demonstrate that the model can be considered valid also for Italian. Besides, a major contribution of this paper is the free availability of the annotated Italian corpus.","We presented, to our knowledge, the first model that transfers on an Italian microtexts corpus the approach developed by (Peldszus and Stede, 2015).

Leveraging the pre-training of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), our strategy is to mask out commas and let BERT guess what to replace them with. Our strategy achieves promising results on a challenging targeted corpus of awkwardly worded sentences from Italian-language college student essays.","Comma splices can be defined as independent clauses joined by a comma without a coordinating conjunction (Hacker, 2009). Comma splices are frequent in both English and Italian and typically suggest a lack of basic understanding of sentence structure. As we will show, they come in various flavors, and there exist subtle differences between how they occur in English and Italian. Comma splices are generally detected by commercial grammar and style checkers, but their automated correction has only been addressed by a few studies specific to English. Because the common denominator shared by such studies is the use of supervised machine learning techniques, the key research question that motivated the present study is whether we can use transfer learning to correct comma splices automatically in a completely unsupervised fashion and in languages other than English. Thanks to contextualized word embeddings, and, in particular, thanks to BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), we show that it is possible to correct common cases of comma splices in Italian. We also discuss the limitations of our unsupervised approach.","While the main limitation of the present study is the limited size of the USS corpus, we believe that the challenging nature of the writing excerpts in the USS corpus has enabled us to stress-test our strategy and to deliver a solid proof of concept that leverages the power of BERT-style contextualized word embeddings for automated style correction.

Question Answering is considered a hard task for natural language processing systems, since full solutions would require both natural language understanding and inference abilities. In this paper, we explore how the state of the art in answer selection has improved recently, comparing two of the best proposed models for tackling the problem: the Cross-attentive Convolutional Network and the BERT model. The experiments are carried out on two datasets, WikiQA and SelQA, both created for and used in open-domain question answering challenges. We also report on cross-domain experiments with the two datasets.","Answer Sentence Selection is an important subtask of Question Answering, that aims at selecting the sentence containing the correct answer to a given question among a set of candidate sentences. Table 1 shows an example of a question and a list of its candidate answers, taken from the SelQA dataset (Jurczyk et al., 2016). The last column contains a binary value, representing whether the sentence contains the answer or not. Answer extraction involves natural language processing techniques for interpreting candidate sentences and establishing whether they relate to questions and contain an answer. More sophisticated methods of Answer Sentence Selection that go beyond Information Retrieval approaches involve, for example, tree edit models (Heilman and Smith, 2010) and semantic distances based on word embeddings (Wang et al., 2016). Recently, Deep Neural Networks have also been applied to this task (Rao et al., 2016), providing performance improvements with respect to previous techniques. The most common approaches exploit either recurrent or convolutional neural networks. These models are good at capturing contextual information from sentences, making them a nice fit for the problem of answer sentence selection. Research on this problem has benefited in the last few years by the development of better datasets for training systems on this task. These datasets include WikiQA (Yang et al., 2015) and SelQA (Jurczyk et al., 2016). The latter is notable for its larger size, that reaches more than 60,000 sentence-question pairs. This allows for the creation of deeper and more complex models, with less risk of overfitting. The state of the art model on the SelQA dataset (Jurczyk et al., 2016), up to 2018, was Cross-attentive Convolutional Network (Gravina et al., 2018), with a score of 0.906 MRR (Craswell, 2009). In this paper, we present further experiments with the Cross-attentive Convolutional Network model as well as experiments that exploit the BERT language model by Devlin et al. (2018). In the following sections, we survey relevant literature on the topic, we describe the datasets used in our experiments and present the models tested in our experiments. Finally, we describe the experiments conducted with these models and report the results achieved.","We compared the Cross-attentive Convolutional Network and several BERT-based models on the task of Answer Sentence Selection on two datasets. The experiments show that a BERT model, fine-tuned on an Answer Sentence Selection dataset, improves significantly the state of the art, with a gain of 5 to 9 points of MRR score on SelQA and WikiQA respectively. As a drawback, this approach takes a considerable amount of time to be trained even on GPUs. The BERT-Base model without fine-tuning achieves almost the same accuracy as the CACN with GloVe embeddings, which uses a much smaller number of parameters in the model. The CACN also requires less data to train. On the other hand, BERT is quite effective at leveraging the knowledge collected from large amounts of unlabeled text, and at transferring it across tasks. We also evaluated the abilities of CACN at transfer learning. BERT is a model that has been pre-trained on a large corpus, while CACN leverages the GloVe embeddings as a starting point for the training. We also exploited the WikiQA and SelQA datasets in a cross-domain experiment using CACN. We found that the model maintains a good score across domains, with a transfer score of about 83% from SelQA to WikiQA. We confirmed that the SelQA dataset is not easily solvable using simple word-occurrences methods like a logistic regression classifier on word count features. BERT models confirmed their superiority to previous state-of-the-art models for the task of Answer Sentence Selection. This was to be expected since they perform quite well also on the more complex task of Reading Comprehension, which requires not only to select a sentence but also to extract the answer from that sentence.",1,Language Models

This task is particularly tricky due to the gap between the vocabularies adopted by users and the formalism that characterizes any query language. For this reason, although its birth as a discipline dates back to the late sixties, Question Answering over structured data is still accomplished to an unsatisfying degree. This result is even more critical if we take into account languages different from English, for which the amount of available resources is limited. In this paper we present MULIB, a Question Answering system capable of answering questions in Italian over both Knowledge Bases and databases.","Question Answering (QA) over structured data has the aim to interpret a natural language question issued by the user and retrieve an answer from a structured data source. Nowadays, the task of QA over structured data is usually performed over Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which encode an enormous amount of information and can thus provide a broad knowledge on many different domains. However, QA over structured data has its roots in the late sixties as an attempt to make databases easily accessible even by non-expert users. For this reason, QA systems were initially referred to as ""Natural Language Interfaces"". Apart from the technical differences existing between KGs and databases, they still share the same properties hold by any structured resource: a Data Representation Language (DRL) allows describing the data in a data source, and a Data Query Language (DQL) is then used to retrieve the data. The standard DQL for databases is SQL, while its correspondent for KGs is SPARQL. The main goal of a QA system is to bridge the so-called lexical gap existing between the vocabulary adopted by the user and the labels used within the structured data source. In this way a QA system can allow users to have access to the information stored in the structured data source with no need for mastering a DQL: the system has to take over the management to this translation, hiding it to the user. Due to its complexity, the majority of works available at the state of the art exploit a combination of several NLP techniques to process the question and transform it into its DQL equivalent. For this reason, the results available at the state of the art appear even more critical when looking for relevant solutions for non-English languages. This problem is accentuated even more by the shortage of multilingual datasets. For example, the QALD evaluation campaign, starting from its third edition, has included a task for Multilingual Question Answering over DBpedia. The dataset created for this task provides each question in seven different languages (i.e. English, German, Spanish, Italian, French, Dutch, and Romanian) along with its SPARQL translation. Even if the dataset actually includes non-English languages, the SPARQL translation always makes use of the resources of the English version DBpedia since many properties and entities do not have a label for the aforementioned languages. Other datasets for Question Answering over Structured Data, like Simple Question (Bordes et al., 2015) and Web Question (Berant et al., 2013) are focused only on the English language and do not provide the translation for other languages. The same issue affects also the datasets available for the evaluation of Natural Language Interfaces for databases like the U.S. Geography database (Geoquery) or IMDb. For all these reasons, there are only a few systems which propose an approach applicable for Italian. FuLL (Bombara et al., 2005) is a NLI for geographical data banks. FuLL exploits a fuzzy engine and a dialog manager to interpret the question inserted by the user and handle subjective elements (like the magnitude of adjectives) and ambiguous requests. However, in order to make the system more accurate, the authors have focused only over a specific domain. QAnswer (Diefenbach et al., 2017) is one of the few QA systems with an architecture completely independent from the language thus it can process many different languages including Italian. The system splits the question in n-grams and tries to match them with the resources of the underlying knowledge graphs. Based on the retrieved resources, it generates all the possible queries that could satisfy the user’s information need. Multilingualism is obtained by avoiding the usage of any NLP tool which could affect the performance of the system, especially for those languages where the accuracy of those tools is still very low. On the other hand, the main disadvantages of this approach are that the identification of relations is based just on the dictionary and the syntax of the question is ignored thus meaning that the lack of resources in a certain language can deeply affect the results. Based on these observations, we decided to develop a QA system for the Italian language. Our approach is based on the one adopted in CANaLI (Mazzeo and Zaniolo, 2016) which obtained the best results within the QALD-6 evaluation campaign (Unger et al., 2016). CANaLI makes use of controlled natural languages and an auto-completion mechanism to guide the user toward the formulation of a natural language question which is then processed using a finite state automaton. By analyzing the advantages and the limitations of this approach, we developed a new system which is capable of reducing the lexical gap and extended it to cover the Italian language and to support queries over traditional databases. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we will introduce and describe our system MULIB, a QA system capable of answering natural language questions written in Italian over an underlying structured data source; in Section 3 is described the evaluation we performed to assess MULIB’s effectiveness; finally, in Section 4 we will discuss the results obtained by MULIB and outline the future directions for our work.","From the answers to the questionnaires, it is clear that MULIB has been perceived positively by the users, who think that it would represent a powerful tool to support their interaction with a DBMS. As future work, we could improve the graphical interface of our system, making it more appealing for the users and integrating some visualization tools which could help to provide a more complete answer by integrating complementary information coming from the database. In conclusion, in this paper, we have presented MULIB, a QA system for Structured Data which is capable to answer questions formulated in English and Italian. We decided to adopt an approach based on Controlled Natural Languages, i.e. the one adopted in systems like CANaLI. By the analysis of the shortcomings of this approach, we designed a specific solution aimed at overcoming them. First of all we adopted distributional semantics principles in order to cope with the lexical gap and we modified the algorithm to cover the issue represented by ambiguous words. Next we extended the approach to cover also the Italian language and allow to query databases as well as Knowledge Graphs. By performing an in-vivo experiment along with 25 participants, we could actually evaluate how helpful users perceive our system.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

However, the morpho-syntactic pre-processing needed to match words in the affective lexicon (lemmatization in particular) may be prone to errors. In this paper, we show how such errors have a substantial and statistically significant impact on the performance of a simple dictionary-based SA model on data from Twitter in Italian. We test three pre-trained statistical models for lemmatization of Italian based on Universal Dependencies, and we propose a simple alternative to lemmatizing the tweets that achieves better polarity classification results.","In the last few years a very large variety of approaches has been proposed for addressing Sentiment Analysis (SA) related tasks. In several approaches, lexical resources play a crucial role: they allow systems to move from strings of characters to the semantic knowledge found, e.g., in an affective lexicon. For achieving this result and calculating the polarity of sentiment, or of some related categories, some shallow morphological analysis has to be applied, which mostly consists in lemmatization. When we refer to standard text, available resources and robust lemmatizers make lemmatization a practically solved issue, but the presence of misspellings, lingo and irregularities makes the application of lemmatization on user-generated content drawn from social media and micro-blogs not equally easy. A possible solution consists in applying supervised machine learning techniques in order to create robust lemmatization models. However, the large manually curated datasets necessary for this task are currently very rare, in particular for languages other than English. For what concerns Italian, a good quality gold standard resource in Universal Dependency has been released which includes texts drawn from micro-blogs, namely PoSTWITA-UD (Sanguinetti et al., 2018). Unfortunately it is not nearly large enough to be of practical use in a supervised machine learning setting. In this paper, we focus on the lemmatization of social media texts, observing and evaluating its impact on SA. The goal of this work is to address the following research questions: what is the impact of lemmatization in SA tasks? Can we classify lemmatization errors and automatically adjust (a relevant portion of) them? We start from the empirical evidence found in a corpus of tweets from the agriculture domain that has initially raised our attention on this problem. After that, we present further experiments on a manually annotated dataset. We further propose some hints about a solution based on an affecting lexicon of inflected forms.","In this paper, we presented an empirical and statistical study on the impact of lemmatization on a NLP pipeline for SA based on an affective lexicon. We found that lemmatization tools need to be used carefully, in order to not introduce too much noise, deteriorating the performance downstream. Then we propose an alternative approach that skips the lemmatization step in favor of a morphologically rich affective resource, in order to alleviate some of the observed issues. We plan on integrating the proposed solutions, including the MAL and an automatic check of the lemma produced by UDpipe, in a pre-processing pipeline based on UDpipe.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

As one of the most important figures of renaissance, Shakespeare wrote characters which express themselves clearly. Thus, the emotional landscape of the plays can be revealed from the texts. It is important to analyze such landscapes for further demonstrating these structures. We use word-emotion association lexicon with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive). By using this lexicon, the emotional state of each character is represented in 10 dimensional space and mapped onto a plane. This principle axes planes position each character relatively. Additionally, tempora-emotional evaluation of each play is graphed. We conclude that the protagonist and the antagonist have different emotional states from the rest and these two emotionally oppose each other. Temporal-Emotional timeline of the plays are meaningful to have a better insight into the tragedies.","Shakespeare's plays are one of the most important works of early modernity with their dramaturgy, strong and in-depth characters and poems, that are all still contemporary. Antagonistically most powerful works of Shakespeare, who wrote in three genres, are tragedies. Tragedies have strong antagonisms and written language is the primary medium for establishing antagonisms. Therefore, the characters in these plays express themselves through dialogues or monologues clearly. By using the emotional association of each word, from this perspective, it is possible to reveal the emotional landscape of the plays. Emotionally positioning the characters relative to each other is important for further understanding of the structure of the plays. It is also important to extract overall emotional variations throughout the play to have an insight about the tragedies. In this study, it is aimed to answer these two questions by using word-emotion association lexicon with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive). These tasks are not only important for artificial literature (Lebrun, 2017; Yavuz, 2020), but also for the purpose of increasing artistic creativity through computerized analysis. The algorithmic study of literary works has given rise to objective criticism in literary theory, (Moretti, 2013). Accordingly, the discovery of new or previously theoretically laid out features of literary texts through mathematical experiments or statistics brought along conjunctions on literature, (Moretti, 2000; Yavuz, 2020). Art and criticism develop in parallel today as of yesterday. Computational linguistics enriched with fields such as advanced chatbots, conversational AI, or text style transfers, the fields give clues that artificial literature will also develop rapidly in the upcoming period. Whether it is a computer-assisted writing process or fully automated writing machines, these generative models need evaluation metrics. For this purpose, objective metrics should be developed for outstanding literary pieces such as Shakespeare, and for what makes these plays so great, if possible… Aim of this paper is in accordance with the previous works, (Yavuz, 2019; Yavuz, 2020), we would like to discuss objective and quantifiable reasons behind the literariness of a drama. In order to convey such analyses, each character in any play represented in 10 dimensional emotional space and mapped onto a plane. The emotional timeline of the plays are also revealed. We would like to overview the word-emotion association lexicon and dimension reduction algorithm. Then, the last section is left to discussions on the emotional states of the characters and temporal analyses of the emotions.","The traces of the tensions between characters are observable from the emotional aspect. As we show, the emotional positions of the protagonist, the antagonist and the main cluster gives much insight about the greatness such pieces. Any great tragedy needs emotional contrast between the main characters and there is always the main cluster. The temporal-emotional characteristics of the plays are also important and very much similar to each other. There are constantly increasing emotions as well as neutrals. Each play grows towards positive, joyful and trusty emotional state. This might be the reason behind a followable play. Positive feelings should accumulate.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The results show that Linear Discriminant Analysis obtains very good performances both in clean and noisy conditions, if used as classifier in ensemble learning and in multi-label text classification.","We address text categorization of businessoriented legal documents in Italian, but with a custom and overlapping hierarchy of product categories. A typical approach to tackle similar tasks is to exploit resources such as EUROVOC (Daudaravicius, 2012), a multilingual thesaurus consisting of over 6700 hierarchically-organised class descriptors used by many organizations of the European Union (EU) for the classification and retrieval of official documents. Our editorial system has a hierarchy of 23 product categories and more than 20600 labels, manually annotated and customized for different clients in more than 15 years, hence it is not possible to exploit resources like EUROVOC to categorize documents. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient method for document classification for noisy data based on Linear Discriminant Analysis, a dimensionality reduction technique that has been employed successfully in many domains, including neuroimaging and medicine. We believe that our contribution will be useful to the NLP community in the context of document categorization as well as automatic ontology population, in particular when dealing with very noisy data.

The results we obtained with the score ranking classification are in line with the state-of-the-art, but our method is more suitable for small and noisy datasets.

This lexical resource increases LiLa's lemma count and tunes its underlying data model to etymological borrowing.","Boasting over two thousand years' worth of written attestation, Latin's evolutionary history is among the longest in existence. The diachronic and geographical reach of the Roman Empire exposed Latin, an Indo-European Italic language, to many regional dialects and languages, including Ancient Greek. The mutually profitable linguistic contact between Latin and Ancient Greek, facilitated by their similar morphosyntactic structures and characteristic syntheticity (Ledgeway, 2012, pp. 10-28), is most evident in their vocabulary, chiefly calques and loanwords. Both lexemes presuppose a certain knowledge of the donor language, but while the former takes from the donor with translation, the latter does not AUTHOR. Examples of Latin words calqued from Ancient Greek are unicornuus ``unicorn'' (unus ``one'' + cornu ``horn'') from mon'okerws (m'onos ``one'' + k'eras ``horn''), and infans ``infant'' (in- ``not'' + fans ``speaking'') from n'hpios (negative prefix nh- + >'epos ``speech''). Calques can also involve affixes, as is the case of Latin's suffix -us being substituted for the Greek -os AUTHOR. The adjective ``dramatic'', for instance, is attested as both dramaticos and dramaticus. Example loanwords in Latin are crocodilus ``crocodile'', imported from the Ancient Greek krok'odeilos, and liquiritia ``liquorice'' from gluk'urriza. Adams identifies three categories of Greek loans in Latin AUTHOR: (1) words for which there existed a Latin equivalent; the writer was so familiar with the local Greek term that he adopted it in response to local conditions; (2) local Greek technical terms for which it might have been difficult to find a Latin equivalent; and (3) transfers determined by a writer's lack of fluency in Latin, as a result of which he either adopted Greek words because he was unaware of their Latin equivalents, or did so unconsciously because of his poor command of Latin. For each category, Adams provides a handful of examples, including (1) (h)amaxa from <'amaxa ``wagon'', (2) buneurum from bo'uneuron ``whip of oxhide'' and (3) arura from >'aroura ``land''. Over the course of its long history, Latin lexicography has produced a plethora of lexical resources, notably dictionaries, thesauri and lexica. Many are available in machine-readable form but their differing annotation schemes and formats are seldom interoperable. In an effort to offset the issue, the LiLa: Linking Latin project is leveraging Linked Data technology to dovetail a wide range of Latin resources into an interoperable whole, producing an ever-growing lexically-based data model capable of accommodating etymological, morphological, syntactic and semantic information, and more besides AUTHOR. In LiLa, glossaries, lexica, treebanks, textual resources and tools intersect and interact through their common denominator, the lemma (itself, incidentally, a loanword from the Ancient Greek lemma). Indeed, the LiLa Knowledge Base hinges on a lemma bank of approximately 130,000 lemmas largely derived from the lexical basis of AUTHOR. As textual and lexical resources are added to the Knowledge Base, LiLa's lemma bank and coverage of the Latin lexicon grow in size. Though chiefly targeting readily available lemmatised resources on the web, LiLa also creates linguistic resources in-house as a means of further developing its underlying data model. Examples of these are the Index Thomisticus Treebank AUTHOR and Latin AUTHOR. Here, we describe the addition of a new homegrown lexical resource, the Index Graecorum Vocabulorum in Linguam Latinam AUTHOR, to the LiLa Knowledge Base of Linguistic Resources for Latin.","This paper describes the preparation and integration of Saalfeld’s Index Graecorum Vocabulorum in Linguam Latinam (1874) in the LiLa Knowledge Base of Linguistic Resources for Latin. This first list of 1, 763 Latin loans from Ancient Greek adds 68 new Latin lemmas to LiLa, stretches its data model to include borrowing and has been mapped to the digitised Greek-English LiddellScott-Jones lexicon. Beyond LiLa, this linguistic resource might be integrated in other resources, such as dictionaries (Bowers and Romary, 2016) or digital scholarly editions. Future improvements might acquire a list of calques (Detreville, 2015; Fruyt, 2011) and the extended edition of Saalfeld’s Index (1884).",5,Latin Resources

We evaluated \name\ on the Italian ISDT, Italian ParTUT, Italian WikiNER and multiclass classification tasks, obtaining F1 scores comparable to those obtained by a BERT base with a remarkable improvement in training and inference speed.","In recent years the introduction of Transformers language models allowed great improvements in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Among Transformer language models, BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) affirmed itself as an highperforming and flexible alternative, being able to transfer knowledge from general tasks to downstream ones thanks to the pretraining-finetuning approach. The context-dependent text representations provided by this model demonstrated to be a richer source of information when compared to static textual embeddings such as Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), FastText (Bojanowski et al., 2016) or Sent2Vec (Pagliardini et al., 2018). However, despite the substantial improvements brought by BERT in the NLP field, the high number of parameters that constitute its network makes its usage prohibitive in resource-limited devices, both at training and inference time, and with a nonnegligible environmental impact. To address the aforementioned problem, recent research proposes several approaches to reduce the size of the BERT network, such as DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019), MobileBERT (Sun et al., 2020) or pruning (Gordon et al., 2020; McCarley et al., 2019). The experiments conducted in Virtanen et al. (2019), de Vries et al. (2019) and Martin et al.

The annotation was performed on the corpus instances of a selected list of 30 verbs and was aimed at both implementing the resource with metonymic patterns and identifying and creating a map of the metonymic relations that occur in the verbal patterns. The annotated corpus data (consisting of 1218 corpus instances), the patterns, and the relations can be useful for NLP tasks such as metonymy recognition.","Metonymy is a language phenomenon for which one referent is used to denote another referent associated with it (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Fauconnier, 1985; Ježek, 2016). For example, in the sentence ‘he drank a glass at the pub’, glass (the metonymic or source type denoting a container) refers to its content (the target type, a beverage). In our research, we investigated metonymy from a corpus-based perspective, through the analysis of corpus data and the annotation performed in T-PAS, a corpus-based resource for Italian verbs. T-PAS consists of a repository of typed predicate argument structures (Ježek et al., 2014), i.e. verbal patterns together with semantically-specified arguments, linked to manually annotated corpus instances (see Section 3.1). An example of a pattern (or t-pas) for the verb bere ‘to drink’ is reported in Figure 1, where [Animate] and [Beverage] are the semantic types specifying the subject and object positions. The annotation of metonymies was performed on the corpus instances of a list of 30 verbs contained in T-PAS (taken from Ježek & Quochi, 2010). As emerged from this background study, the semantic properties of those verbs were likely to convey metonymies in their argument structures. Starting from this list, our work was intended as an implementation of the resource; specifically, we annotated metonymic corpus instances and created metonymic sub-patterns linked to them. The research had several aims. First, we were interested in studying qualitatively the phenomenon in and through the corpus instances and in implementing the annotation tool of the resource with a specific feature that allowed us to encode metonymic arguments in the verbal patterns. For the latter purpose, we collaborated with the Faculty of Informatics at Masaryk University of Brno (CZ): they gave us the technical support for the implementation of the annotation tool. Second, our intention was to conceive a general theoretical framework to represent the metonymies found through the qualitative corpus analysis, by designing a map of metonymies and by drafting a list of the metonymic relations that occur in the verbal patterns (see Section 4). The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present related studies. In Section 3 we describe the methodology we followed in annotating the corpus instances for metonymies, together with a brief introduction to T-PAS. In Section 4 we present the results of our annotation: a generalization of the metonymic relations found, and a map which visually highlights the semantic and cognitive connections between the semantic types. Further developments of the project are described in Section 5; our intention is to enrich the number of analysed verbs and eventually add new types of metonymic relations.","In this paper, we approached the study of metonymy from a corpus-based perspective. The research was conducted on a selected list of verbs, taken from a background study (Ježek & Quochi, 2010). Our aim was to search for metonymic phenomena inside a corpus of Italian language and to register them in a resource for Italian verbs, T-PAS. To do so, we conceived an annotation scheme and procedure that gave us relevant results and allowed us to register a variety of metonymic relations. We also attempted to make some theoretical generalizations based on the metonymic relations we found through the corpus analysis. We therefore created a list of metonymic relations and we designed a map in which the relations are connected to the semantic types they involve. Both the map and the list depict the complexity and variety of the phenomenon, in terms of number of possible metonymic relations and of the semantic types interested. In future perspectives, we intend to enrich the map and the list with new relations by extending the number of verbs investigated and to evaluate the annotation procedure. For future annotations, we will provide the current version of the list and of the map on the online public version of T-PAS (upcoming). We are also interested in comparing our results with those in Marini & Ježek (2020), in a cross-linguistic perspective. In line with previous studies (Section 2), we believe that the annotated corpus data, as well as the relations in Table 2, could be useful for automatic detection of metonymies. To our knowledge, little work has been done on this for Italian language: it would be therefore intriguing to test our data in NLP tasks.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Potentially offensive comments have been collected for more than 1,000 images and manually assigned to a semantic category. Our analysis shows that the presence of human subjects, as well as the gender of the people present in the pictures trigger different types of comment, and provides novel insight into the connection between images posted on social media and offensive messages. We also compare our corpus with a similar one obtained with WhatsApp, showing that comments to images show different characteristics compared to text-only interactions.","In order to study abusive language online, the availability of datasets containing the linguistic phenomena of interest are of crucial importance. However, when it comes to specific target groups, for example teenagers, collecting such data may be problematic due to issues with consent and privacy restrictions. Furthermore, while text-only datasets for abusive language detection have been widely developed and used by the NLP community, limitations set by image-based social media platforms like Instagram make it difficult for researchers to experiment with multimodal data. We therefore present a novel corpus containing images and potentially offensive Italian comments and we analyse it from different perspectives, to investigate whether the subject of the images plays a role in triggering a comment. %We find that users judge the same images in different ways, although the presence of a person in the picture increases the probability to get an offensive comment. The data collection was carried out in several school classes, being part of a `living lab' to raise awareness on cyberbullying and, more generally, on the use of social media by teenagers. The dataset is freely available on Github and, since the comments were collected with the written consent of parents and teachers, they can be freely used for research purposes, without the ethical implications that would derive from using real data posted by teenage users. The images, instead, are released as a ResNet-18 neural network trained on ImageNet, similar to recent NLP works AUTHOR, since they were taken from Instagram and cannot be shared as pictures.","In this work we present a multimodal dataset in the abusive language domain created by teenage participants who, during online annotation sessions, judged whether images may trigger an offensive comment, left a possible comment and also assigned to it a trigger category. The analysis of the collected data gives interesting insights into how Instagram-like platforms work. First of all, images containing persons are more likely to trigger potentially offensive comments than those without a human subject. Both female and male subjects are offended but the reasons may differ: the former are targeted more because of the pose and of the clothing, while the latter for the pose and the facial expression. In general, the reasons why a comment is triggered seems to be subjective, depending on the user leaving the comment rather on some actual characteristics of the person portrayed in the picture. We conducted our data collection using Instagram pictures randomly taken from this platform, because it is the social network that is most used by teenagers, including those involved in our annotation sessions. However, this makes the release of the full dataset impossible, because of a very restrictive policy concerning images. We therefore adopt a strategy already used within the NLP research community (Kruk et al., 2019), releasing the images as a layer of a ResNet-18 neural network trained on ImageNet. The comments, instead, are freely available without restrictions due to the consent signed by all parents and by the anonymity granted to participants. This represents a very interesting dataset from a research point of view, since it includes comments written by underage students that are usually difficult to obtain because of privacy reasons. In the future, we plan to extend our study to compare the judgements given by single users to those given by groups of peers. In a preliminary study, we observed that, when students are given the possibility to discuss with a small group of peers whether they would like to write an offensive comment, they tend to be more aggressive and are more likely to select ‘yes’. While the comments collected so far with groups of annotators are not enough to allow a fair comparison between the two settings (single vs. group), we plan to extend them in the future and pursue also this interesting research line. Finally, we plan to train a classifier able to detect offensive messages by merging visual and textual features with the goal to integrate it in a monitoring tool like the one introduced in (Menini et al., 2019). This would enable a more holistic, context-aware understanding of offensive communication online.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

In particular, it describes the conversion of the original TEI-XML files to CoNLL-U, the creation of a gold standard, the process of training four annotators and the evaluation of the syntactic annotation in terms of inter-annotator agreement and LA, UAS and LAS . The aim is to release a new resource, in view of the celebrations for the 700th anniversary of Dante’s death, which can support the development of the Vocabolario Dantesco.","The research field of treebanking (i.,e., the building of corpora enhanced with syntactic metadata) has evolved substantially since the time when the first large-scale syntactically annotated corpus, the Penn Treebank for English, was published between the late Eighties and the early Nineties AUTHOR. Across the last two decades, the range of languages for which a treebank is available has increased considerably. The grammar framework behind the most widespread annotation style currently used in treebanking has also changed: treebanks annotated according to various styles of dependency grammars have been increasingly outnumbering those based on constituency (or phrase-structure) grammars, as demonstrated by the current status of the Universal Dependencies initiative (ud) containing more than 160 treebanks and 90 languages which follow the same, dependency-based, annotation style AUTHOR. The set of textual genres covered by currently available treebanks is quite diverse. While the first corpora were built mostly collecting texts from news, the last decade has seen a substantial growth of treebanks of different genres, including literary texts, mostly written in ancient or historical languages. The first available treebanks for ancient languages were those for Ancient Greek and/or Latin, namely the Index Thomisticus Treebank (it-tb) AUTHOR and the Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank from the Perseus digital library AUTHOR. With regard to Latin, the available treebanks in ud cover just a minimal subset of the Latin texts that have survived the centuries and which show a wide diversity, mostly due to Latin's lingua franca role played all over Europe up until the 1800s AUTHOR. So far, the treebanks for Latin include only portions of the Classical and Late Latin canon of texts (Perseus and proiel AUTHOR), a set of Early Medieval charters from Tuscia (Late Latin Charter Treebank AUTHOR) and a selection of Late Medieval philosophical-theological texts by Thomas Aquinas (it-tb), for a total of more than 800,000 nodes. Among the many Latin texts that still lack syntactic annotation are those by Dante Alighieri (1265-1321). Given the importance of Dante in the history of Italian literature (and beyond) and in the light of the celebrations for the upcoming 700th anniversary of his death, we have started a project (called UDante) aimed at performing a ud-compliant syntactic annotation of all his Latin texts. The syntactic annotation of Dante's opera omnia in Latin fits into the larger project of the Vocabolario Dantesco, which aspires to provide a detailed description of the entire (both Vulgar and Latin) lexicon of Dante Alighieri. Indeed, during the composition of entries for the vocabulary, lexicographers will benefit from having the possibility to run syntactic queries on Dante's works. The choice of using the ud formalism in the UDante project is motivated by a number of benefits implied by the inclusion of a new set of annotated texts into such a large collection of treebanks sharing the same annotation style, among others the use of the several tools developed by the ud community with the goal of querying, editing, visualizing and (automatically) processing the (meta)data of the treebanks. Particularly, a remarkable added value is the possibility to run common queries on the almost 100 different languages provided with at least one treebank in the current version of ud (v2.6, released on May 15th, 2020). Furthermore, adopting a well known and widely used data format (CoNLL-U) and part-of-speech tagset (upos) fosters the dissemination and use of a treebank of Dante's Latin works in the community of computational linguistics, laying the foundation for a closer collaboration with that of Italian phylology and, more generally, with scholars in the Humanities, leading to a mutual benefit. This paper presents the process behind the development of the manually annotated ud treebank containing the full collection of Latin works of Dante Alighieri. More specifically, we describe the conversion of the original tei-xml files into the CoNLL-U format, we give details on the creation of a gold standard and we report on the training of four annotators with no previous knowledge of the ud formalism, providing an evaluation of their annotation work.","In this paper, we describe the preliminary steps towards the creation of a UD-compliant treebank of the Latin works by Dante Alighieri. To this end, we create a gold standard and we train and evaluate the work of a team of four annotators by means of a tripartite common set of sentences of increasing complexity annotated by a UD expert, complemented by specific gold standards for each annotator in a final control phase before the actual annotation work takes place. Besides supporting the objectives of the Vocabolario Dantesco project, the development of a treebank based on Dante’s Latin works also serves a wider scope, i. e. the inclusion of these latters into the LiLa Knowledge Base, which makes distributed linguistic resources for Latin interoperable through the Linked Data paradigm (Passarotti et al., 2020).16 At the same time, the efforts put into this project will hopefully bring forth some much-needed recommended guidelines for the UD-style annotation of Latin. The complete annotation of Dante’s Latin works will provide the community with a new, manually annotated dataset of higher quality than any automatic system. Table 4 reports LAS scores computed on the sentences of our gold standard and processed with UDPipe using the UD v2.5 models for Latin (Straka and Straková, 2017). The scores clearly show that current models are not good enough to parse the Latin of Dante. The addition of Dante’s Latin works into the thriving and expanding UD project and the newly acquired possibility to interact with a large number of other Latin texts of different genres and time periods makes us hope for a breakthrough of the world of treebanking into the wider community of the Humanities, which today can benefit from accessing a huge set of connected textual (meta)data like never before.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

Starting from the corpus TWITA, we have created a Sentiment Analysis to observe any changes in the polarity of user writings, in response to eleven institutional speeches held during the health emergency. Variations were observed in response to three speeches by the President of the Council on 4 March, 9 March and 26 April 2020 respectively.","The Covid-19 epidemic quickly spread from Wuhan, China, to numerous nations around the world and on March 28, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the state of the Covid-19 pandemic. In Italy, the first case was reported on 21 February 2020; the contagions then spread to different regions and on 8 March 2020 the entire nation was declared a red zone. A national lockdown was also established, which lasted about two months, until 4 May 2020. The emergency situation has been dramatic and completely new: institutional communications, aimed at illustrating containment measures and directing the behaviour of the population, have therefore played a decisive role. Their diffusion took place both through public television and through social networks, such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter; as a result, these have become the main channels of dissemination of information and sharing opinions. The Sentiment Analysis is a multidisciplinary field of study aimed at investigating and evaluating the opinions expressed in the AUTHOR texts that is the orientation (positive or negative) that the speaker expresses towards an AUTHOR object through lexical devices. Twitter is a privileged source of data for the analysis of emotions and opinions, so much so that today we talk about Twitter Sentiment Analysis (TSA) to identify the specific branch of research based on data extracted from this social network. Today, TSA is used in various areas and for various purposes, such as monitoring users' views on AUTHOR commercial products, studying AUTHOR policy guidelines, analysing levels and causes of stress among AUTHOR adolescents or public opinion about AUTHOR vaccines. This study uses TSA to investigate the impact of institutional communications during the health crisis of Covid-19 in Italy. Specifically, the sentiment of Italian tweets on coronavirus was analysed to identify correlations between the polarity of user opinions (positive or negative) and the speeches given by the President of the Council and the President of the Republic during the pandemic.","To conclude, this study aims to investigate the reactions of Italian citizens to institutional communications during the Covid-19 epidemic. Thanks to the increasing use of social networks, it is in fact possible to explore the psychological reactions to traumatic events, both individual and collective: according to our data, institutional communications that have provoked stronger psychological-emotional reactions are those pronounced on March 4 and 9 and April 26, 2020, which announced the most drastic measures of containment of the epidemic. Further studies could expand this work, considering different national contexts (both where virus containment measures similar to Italian ones have been implemented, and where very different measures have been implemented). In addition, they could be objects of analysis different socio-political events, as suggested by the study Emoitaly (e.g. General elections, International Workers' Day, murder of George Floyd).",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We find strong associations with gender in job-related WEs. Weaker gender stereotypes are present in other domains where grammatical gender plays a significant role.","In the literature, the study of gender bias in word embeddings (WEs) is of interest for two main reasons: (i) WEs, as components of automatic decision systems (e.g. job search tools), may contribute to harm some user groups AUTHOR; (ii) WEs can be employed as a tool to measure the biases of text corpora AUTHOR and systems for automatic text classification or information retrieval AUTHOR. In both applications, it is important to isolate the gender-related information in a subspace AUTHOR and subsequently (i) eliminate it via orthogonal projection or (ii) exploit it as a lens to study association of concepts with gender. A common taxonomy of bias in algorithms concentrates on the types of harm that they may cause AUTHOR. Allocational harms happen when a limited resource (e.g. jobs) is assigned unfairly to subgroups of a population (e.g. women and men). Representational harms arise when groups or individuals are unable to determine their image, which is presented unfavourably or neglected. Autocomplete suggestions in search engines AUTHOR are a clear example of this situation. Query completion suggestions for ``why are italian ...'' associate diverse concepts to the country and its inhabitants. Italians contribute very little to these results as they are unlikely to search information about themselves in English. Italian WEs have been developed AUTHOR and analyzed AUTHOR, following seminal work in English; analysis of gender bias has unfortunately lagged behind. Our main contribution is to close this gap, by undertaking a systematic study of gender stereotypes in Italian WEs, adapting established approaches that assess gender bias in English WEs.","Overall, we have analyzed gender bias in Italian WEs, adapting existing techniques and gathering data where required. We looked for stereotypical associations with gender-imbalanced professions, Career and Family, Science and Arts, finding significant associations in 2 out of 3. As expected from prior work (Gonen et al., 2019; McCurdy and Serbetci, 2020), grammatical gender is a strong confounder in these analyses. We draw the following preliminary conclusions: (i) Italian WEs seem to have less potential than their English counterparts to systematically reinforce the tested gender stereotypes, mostly due to grammatical gender. However, (ii) the influence of grammatical gender on WEs may cause different harms. As an example, in the context of job search, masculine is likely to be the default choice for queries of recruiters (male as norm - e.g. ``psicologo'' [psychologist]). Those queries would likely be closer to male candidates’ CVs than equivalent female ones, in some embedded text representations, potentially putting women at a systematic disadvantage. Both points above require further analysis of text retrieval/classification systems based on Italian WEs. Finally, (iii) isolating stereotypical concepts and gendered associations in Italian WEs along a single direction is challenging. The tested WEs show little promise as a reliable measurement tool for gender-stereotypical associations, unless combined with approaches to mitigate the influence of grammatical gender.",21,Gender and Inclusive Language Studies

Its detection plays a crucial role for the individual, with possible evolutionary consequences for the species. Considering (1) its bound with communication and (2) its social nature, we hypothesise the combination of (a) linguistic and (b) community-level features to have a positive impact on the automatic recognition of ostracism in human online communities. We model an English linguistic community through Reddit data and we analyse the performance of simple classification algorithms. We show how models based on the combination of (a) and (b) generally outperform the same architectures when fed by (a) or (b) in isolation.","Ostracism is a social phenomenon meant to ignore or exclude an individual from a group, performed by an individual or a group. Due to its relevance in our everyday life - as a threat to basic needs AUTHOR - and its impact on community-level essential patterns - such as mother-infant attachment, xenophobia, and leadership AUTHOR - each person must develop a system to predict and avoid it. Humans and other social animals (such as rhesus monkeys, for example) use ostracism as a form of social control on problematic group members, as a way to strengthen their group and to remove members that do not conform to social norms. Moreover, it reinforces the hierarchical role of the perpetrators while causing the social or even the actual death of their direct victims. For these reasons, the scope of ostracism allows researchers to assume that its identification has adaptive advantages AUTHOR. Given its intrinsic relation with communication and its community-level impact, we assume that its detection can be automatised relying on linguistic and extra-linguistic, community-level, social features. We expect both the types of information to be predictive but to work best when combined. Reddit communities can be used as proxies of linguistic communities since they provide huge amounts of linguistic data paired with social information. The performance of minimal binary classifiers, such as Naive Bayes and SVM, can be investigated to analyse the relevance of such cues to distinguish between prospective ostracised or not-ostracised members of a group, modelling our adaptive ability to detect ostracism in advance.","We explored the phenomenon of social exclusion through Reddit data within a period of 9 years. We collected reactions addressed to moderators, here considered as leading figures of the groups. We selected 10 moderators that left the community influenced by the linguistic and non-linguistic behaviour of the group they lead. We performed a binary classification task on a total of 14200 linguistic reactions addressed to each of the target moderators, analysing the influence of linguistic and extra-linguistic or social patterns on two simple models' performance. We showed how the performance of both models increases if linguistic and extra-linguistic features are combined. The best combination of features, concerning the SVM model, is given by the combination of all the linguistic features and all the social features considered. We can consider this work as an attempt to follow the statements of the sociolinguistics that considers language as intrinsically bound up with society AUTHOR. Our experiment and the relative techniques are simple and easy to replicate. We think that they can be also applied in non-English domains, just using a translating system for the stop-words. All the other features can be directly generalised to other languages.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

A Case Study on Italian L2 writings,ENG,3,3,1,Università di Torino,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Turin,"In this paper we present a pilot study on human performance for the Native Language Identification task. We performed two tests aimed at exploring the human baseline for the task in which test takers had to identify the writers' L1 relying only on scripts written in Italian by English, French, German and Spanish native speakers. Then, we conducted an error analysis considering the language background of both test takers and text writers.","Native Language Identification (NLI) is a task usually performed by machines consisting in identifying the mother tongue (henceforth L1) of a person based only on their writings in another language (e.g. L2 or L3). To date, the majority of the existing studies have focused on English as L2, that is English used by people who are acquiring English as a second or foreign language (Tomokiyo and Jones, 2001; Koppel et al., 2005; Malmasi et al., 2015; Kulmizev et al., 2017; Markov et al., 2017; Cimino and Dell’Orletta, 2017, among others). Three editions of the NLI shared task had been organized (Tetreault et al., 2013; Schuller et al., 2016; Malmasi et al., 2017) in which systems had to correctly identify the L1 among 11 L1s. The basic assumption of this task is that when we learn a new language (henceforth Target Language, TL), our L1 interferes within the learning process introducing in the TL productions clues that can be automatically detected. Nevertheless, another issue to be investigated within this task is the interference in the TL learner’s productions also of other languages previously learned as L2 or L3. In fact, L1 may not be the only language playing a role in the acquisition of a TL, since “bi- or multilingualism is as frequent in the population of the world as pure monolingualism, perhaps even more frequent” (Hammarberg, 2001, p. 21). This issue is especially relevant performing the NLI task in languages other than English. For instance, when someone learns Italian, it is likely their L3, since English is the language taught worldwide as L2 (with more that 100 million learners, as stated in the British Council annual report 2018-19). In this paper, we investigate the human performance for NLI applied on productions of learners Italian, thus focusing not only on the issues related to second language acquisition (Ellis, 2015; Slabakova, 2016), but also to third language acquisition (Cenoz et al., 2001; Picoral, 2020). We asked human Test Takers (TTs) to perform a simplified NLI task on learner Italian scripts extracted from VALICO (Corino and Marello, 2017), selecting only four L1s —i.e. English (EN), French (FR), German (DE) and Spanish (ES). This simplified task will be challenging since all the selected languages are Indo-European languages sharing typological similarities. Moreover, we performed an error analysis of the test results considering learners’ L1 and L2(s) and learning stage (i.e. year of study), in addition to text features and TTs’ language background. Test results could be useful for the improvement of the error annotation scheme introduced in Di Nuovo et al. (2019). Our research questions therefore are: 1. How good are humans in performing the NLI task? 2. What features share the most problematic texts? We try to answer to these questions in this paper organized as follows: in Section 2 we briefly describe previous work on the subject; in Section 3 we describe the tests performed and discuss the results; in Section 3.2 we conduct the error analysis; and in Section 4 we conclude the paper.","In this paper we described two human NLI tests for Italian. Although it was a simplified NLI task, tailored bearing in mind human skills, it proved to be a difficult task even for experts. The error analysis showed that ES was the easiest L1 to identify—correctly identified 60% of the time—while DE the hardest. L2 transfer was misleading, even when L1 clues were present. TTs knowledge of the involved L1s proved not to be a discriminant factor. It would have been interesting to ask the TTs to point out the clues that supported their answers to be less hypothetical in the discussion, especially when dealing with texts featured by L1 and L2 transfer. For this reason, we asked our TTs to take part in another test based on the same texts in which they have to highlight the clues. At the moment, we are collecting the answers. In the future, we will test a machine learning system on the same texts to compare its results with those of our TTs.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

To that end, we explore the eRisk 2018 dataset and achieve good results with regard to the state of the art by leveraging topic analysis and learned confidence scores to guide the decision process.","Mental illnesses are a common problem of our modern world. More than one in ten people was living with mental health disorders in 2017 AUTHOR, with women being the most affected. These disorders affect people's way of thinking, mood, emotions, behaviour and their relationships with others. Most mental illnesses remain undiagnosed because of the social stigma around them. Depression is one of the main causes of disability globally, it affects people of all ages. Prevention is used to reduce depression and to save the lives of people at risk of suicide, but prevention is only limited to raising awareness and programs to cultivate positive thinking in case of depression and monitoring people who attempted suicide or self-harm. With the rise in social media use, more computational efforts are made to detect mental illnesses such as depression AUTHOR and PTSD AUTHOR, but also to detect misogyny AUTHOR, irony and sarcasm AUTHOR from users' texts. People tend to talk more about their emotions and mental health problems online and to seek support. The sources of mental health cues used for detection are Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and forums AUTHOR. Reddit is a social media site very similar to forums. It is organized in subreddits with specific topics, some dedicated to mental health problems. The use of throwaway accounts to maintain anonymity promotes disclosure, and users are more likely to share problems they have not discussed with anyone before. The use of these accounts makes it difficult for users to receive more social support because the majority of them are used only for one post AUTHOR. In this work, we choose to tackle the problem of detecting early onset of depression from users' posts on social media, specifically from Reddit. As such, we explore the eRisk 2018 dataset through topic analysis by means of Latent Semantic Indexing AUTHOR and learned out-of-distribution confidence scores AUTHOR.

Besides its initial use case in out-of-distribution detection, we repurposed the confidence score as a measure for how much the model trusts its classification output to be correct.

392_2020,2020,version_24/clic_it_2020-master/main.tex,"Alberto Testoni, Raffaella Bernardi",Overprotective Training Environments Fall Short at Testing Time: Let Models Contribute to Their Own Training,ENG,2,1,0,Università di Trento,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Trento,"Despite important progress, conversational systems often generate dialogues that sound unnatural to humans. We conjecture that the reason lies in their different training and testing conditions: agents are trained in a controlled ``lab'' setting but tested in the ``wild''. During training, they learn to generate an utterance given the human dialogue history. On the other hand, during testing, they must interact with each other, and hence deal with noisy data. We propose to fill this gap by training the model with mixed batches containing both samples of human and machinegenerated dialogues. We assess the validity of the proposed method on GuessWhat?!, a visual referential game.","Important progress has been made in the last years on developing conversational agents, thanks to the introduction of the encoder-decoder framework (Sutskever et al., 2014) that allows learning directly from raw data for both natural language understanding and generation. Promising results were obtained both for chit-chat (Vinyals and Le, 2015) and task-oriented dialogues (Lewis et al., 2017). The framework has been further extended to develop agents that can communicate about a visual content using natural language (de Vries et al., 2017; Mostafazadeh et al., 2017; Das et al., 2017a). It is not easy to evaluate the performance of dialogue systems, but one crucial aspect is the quality of the generated dialogue. These systems must in fact produce a dialogue that sounds natural to humans in order to be employed in realworld scenarios. Although there is not a general agreement on what makes a machine-generated text sound natural, some features can be easily identified: for instance, natural language respects syntactic rules and semantic constraints, it is coherent, it contains words with different frequency distribution but that crucially are informative for the conveyed message, and it does not have repetitions, both at a token and a sentence level. Unfortunately, even state-of-the-art dialogue systems often generate a language that sounds unnatural to humans, in particular with respect to the large number of repetitions contained in the generated output. We conjecture that part of the problem is due to the training paradigm adopted by most of the systems. In the Supervised Learning training paradigm, the utterances generated by the models during training are used only to compute a Log Likelihood loss function with the gold-standard human dialogues and they are then thrown away. In a multi-turn dialogue setting, for instance, the follow-up utterance is always generated starting from the human dialogue and not from the previously generated output. In this way, conversational agents never really interact one with the other. This procedure resembles a controlled ``laboratory setting'', where the agents are always exposed to ``clean'' human data at training time. Crucially, when tested, the agents are instead left alone ``in the wild'', without any human supervision. They have to ``survive'' in a new environment by exploiting the skills learned in the controlled lab setting and by interacting one with the other. Agents trained in a Reinforcement Learning fashion are instead trained ``in the wild'' by maximizing a reward function based on the task success of the agent, at the cost of a significant increase of computational complexity. Agents trained according to this paradigm generate many repetitions and the quality of the dialogue degrades. This issue is mildly solved by the Cooperative Learning training, but still, several repetitions occur in the dialogues, making them sound unnatural. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method to alter the training environment so that it becomes more similar to the testing one (see Figure 1). In particular, we propose to replace part of the human training data with dialogues generated by conversational agents talking to each other; these dialogues are ``noisy'', since they may contain repetitions, a limited vocabulary etc. We then propose to train a new instance of the same conversational agent on this new training set. The model is now trained ``out of the lab'' since the data it is exposed to are less controlled and they get the model used to live in an environment more similar to the one it will encounter during testing. We assessed the validity of the proposed method on a referential visual dialogue game, GuessWhat?! (de Vries et al., 2017). We found that the model trained according to our method outperforms the one trained only on human data with respect both to the accuracy in the guessing game and to the linguistic quality of the generated dialogues. In particular, the number of games with repeated questions drops significantly.","Despite impressive progress on developing proficient conversational agents, current state-of-theart systems produce dialogues that do not sound as natural as they should. In particular, they contain a high number of repetitions. To address this issue, methods presented so far in the literature implement new loss functions, or modify the models’ architecture. When applied to referential guessing games, these techniques have the drawback of gaining little improvement, degrading the accuracy of the referential game, or producing incoherent dialogues. Our work presents a simple but effective method to improve the linguistic output of conversational agents playing the GuessWhat?! game. We modify the training set by replacing part of the dialogues produced by human annotators with machine-generated dialogues. We show that a state-of-the-art model benefits from being trained on this new mixed dataset: being exposed to a small number of ``imperfect'' dialogues at training time improves the quality of the output without deteriorating its accuracy on the task. Our results show an absolute improvement in the accuracy of +1.8% and a drop in the number of dialogues containing duplicated questions of around -14%. Further work is required to check the effectiveness of this approach on other tasks/datasets, and to explore other kinds of perturbations on the input of generative neural dialogue systems.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

An LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network is trained to associate the phonetic representation of a word, encoded as a sequence of feature vectors, to its corresponding semantic representation in a multilingual vector space. The processing network is tested, without further training, in a language that does not appear in the training set. The performance of the multilingual model is compared with a monolingual upper bound and a randomized baseline. After the quantitative evaluation of its performance, a qualitative analysis is carried out on the network's most effective predictions, showing an inhomogeneous distribution of phonosemantic information in the lexicon, influenced by semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic factors.","The idea of a consistent relationship between sound and meaning has held a particular fascination over philosophers and linguists (Plato, 1998). However, in recent times, this charming hypothesis has progressively lost the interest of scholars, especially in the post-Saussurean linguistic tradition, which emphasized the arbitrariness in such relation. The idea that sounds have inherent meanings has recaptured its original attractiveness in the field of cognitive sciences, where the attention has initially focused on the link between sound and shape. A prominent example of these naturally biased mappings came from Köhler’s (1929) finding that, when asked to match two novel shapes with the non-words ‘maluma’ and ‘takete’, English-speaking adults tended to label as ‘maluma’ the curled shape, and as ‘takete’ the sharp one. This germinal study paved the way to several replications and expansions of its findings, that reproduced Köhler’s results in different geocultural contexts (Bremner et al., 2013) and at different developmental stages (Maurer et al., 2006). Since then, different studies have tackled the topic of iconicity in language from a broader perspective, showing that adults can associate visually presented characters (Koriat and Levy, 1977) and auditorily presented words (Berlin, 1995) of a foreign language to their meaning, with an accuracy above chance. Recently, linguistic iconicity has gone from being a marginal – although appealing – matter to being integrated into broader theories of language evolution and acquisition. Indeed, rejecting the assumption of an arbitrary mapping between sound and meaning sensibly reduces the problem space of language emergence, establishing constraints on the consensus of word choice. Furthermore, an iconic relation between a sound and its referent might help with memory consolidation in the process of language acquisition (Sathian and Ramachandran, 2019). Ramachandran and Hubbard (2001) speculate that phenomena as the one reported by Köhler might arise from neural connections among adjacent cortical areas, where the visual features of the referent, the appearance of the speaker’s lips and the kinaesthetic features of the articulation are combined. According to their view, such neural connections would have influenced both the phylogenetic evolution and the ontogenetic development of language. Although the previous findings are consistent with this hypothesis, an alternative explanation must be taken into account: the roots of these correspondences could be grounded in the knowledge of language, that allows children and adults to generalize the regularities in sound-to-meaning mappings from their native language to nonsense and foreign words. Under this rationale, phonosemantic relations would be implicitly learned from general recurrences in already known languages. A crucial aspect of this account lies in the fact that it does not posit any preexisting disposition wired in the human brain, moving the locus of linguistic iconicity from the mind to language itself. A natural question that arises from this perspective is whether linguistic information alone is sufficient to give rise to the phonaesthetic biases presented in the literature. A computational exploration of the phenomenon under scrutiny is a feasible way to approach the subject. The idea that phones have inherent meanings is relatively understudied within the computational framework, and most of the studies addressing the topic have either focused on a single language (Gutiérrez et al., 2016; Sagi and Otis, 2008; Abramova et al., 2013; Monaghan et al., 2014; Tamariz, 2008) or on a small set of concepts on a massively multilingual scale (Blasi et al., 2016; Wichmann et al., 2010). Surprisingly, no study to our knowledge has tackled the topic through a deep learning methodology, and no cross-linguistic investigation has been performed on a lexicon-wide level. The purpose of the present study is two-fold: first, we wish to explore the idea of a cross-linguistic correspondence between the phonetic and the semantic representation of a word on the whole lexicon, without any theory-driven restriction guiding our choice of the lexical items. Then, we aim to examine whether the meaning that is rooted in the sound that words are made of is homogeneously distributed in the lexicon. Ultimately, these two goals converge toward the research question hinted above, namely, whether linguistic information alone could suffice for the extrapolation of the phonosemantic biases reported in the present section. A possible way to answer this question is to assess the ability of a tabula rasa neural network to extend the regularities captured in a set of given languages to a previously unseen one. Although equipped with clear structural priors, neural networks do not conceal biases that resemble those assumed to model the aforementioned phonosemantic correspondences. If a processing network showed the ability to induce cross-linguistic regularities in sound-to-meaning mappings, this would suggest that linguistic data contain a sufficient amount of information to encode for phonosymbolic biases. The present study aims to explore the possibility of a certain degree of cross-linguistic correspondence between sound and meaning that is already encoded in language. A Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is trained on four languages to associate the sequence of sounds that compose a word, encoded as phonetic vectors, to its corresponding semantic representation in a multilingual vector space. Then the processing network is tested, without further training, on a language that does not appear in the set of languages on which the training has been performed. The performance of the multilingual model is compared with the results of (a) a monolingual model, trained and tested on different subsets of a single language’s vocabulary, and (b) a baseline model, where the output vectors in the training are randomly shuffled. After the quantitative evaluation of its performance, a qualitative analysis is carried out on the network’s most effective predictions.","From a methodological standpoint, the reliability of the present results could benefit from the exclusion of lexical borrowings and proper names from the training and the test sets. Excluding etymologically related terms could further improve the reliability of the results, but at the costs of raising the difficulty of assessing the words’ relatedness in different languages, with the subsequent need of a proper metric. Another confound that we wish to address in future research is the role played by morphological factors in aiding the cross-linguistic feature extraction performed by the network. FastText vectors exploit information related to subword character strings, and might therefore encode regularities pertaining to recurrent morphemes in the nonisolating languages in our dataset (Italian, German, French, and Turkish). We acknowledge that the network might have captured the recurrences encoded in the semantic vectors comprising the training set and their relationships with the corresponding phonetic feature vectors; indeed, we believe that this regularities might have played a relevant role in the monolingual condition, where the model might have learnt that morphologically related words (i.e. in this context, words that are similar at the character- and phoneme-level) tend to be associated with close subregions of the semantic space. Nonetheless, we do not see how this information could have altered significantly the performance in the multilingual condition. That said, we leave for future research an assessment of the algorithm’s performance on semantic vectors which lack access to subword-related information, such as word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), and in languages with opaque orthography (e.g. English and French) and non-concatenative morphology (e.g. Chinese). As for all the studies that employ artificial neural networks to draw conclusions on human cognition, it is mandatory to clarify some limitations on the extent of the inferences that can legitimately follow the presented results. The finding that a neural network can succeed in a task without the structural priors postulated in the human mind does not necessarily imply that these priors are not actually encoded in the brain: the assumption of a functional equivalence between artificial and biological processes needs to be independently motivated. Moreover, it should be noticed that the participants of the behavioural studies presented in Section 1 were not necessarily polyglots, whereas the promising cross-linguistic performances described in the results have been obtained with a multilingual model. In addition to these intrinsic methodological limitations, an account that does not assume any prior specification for the linguistically encoded phonosymbolic mappings would leave an open question concerning their origin. Hence, the present study does not claim to reject the multi-sensory integration hypothesis presented in the Introduction. Its purpose is simply to show that, in principle, linguistic information alone could suffice for a generalization in sound-to-meaning mappings.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The evaluation is carried out for English\rightarrowSpanish, English\rightarrowItalian and English\rightarrowFrench.","Gender manifests itself in a language in many ways, and different languages use different linguistic devices to mark (or sometimes `not mark') gender. When dealing with language, three types of gender come into play: natural gender, grammatical gender and social gender. Natural gender is generally based on the sex of a person or an animal realised by means of the male/female polarity or on the absence of sex for neutral nouns. Grammatical gender, instead, is not always coherent with the semantic categorization of a word and can vary from language to language since it depends on the representation of objects in the world on the basis of specific properties attributed to them in a specific cultural context. Social gender is used in relation to the properties of a word on the basis of which the speakers of a language associate the natural gender of a person to a word AUTHOR: this mainly happens with names of professions, such as for instance doctor or nurse which are interpreted according to social stereotypes concerning the roles of males and females in the society. Gender is present in the data we use to train MT systems due to the demographic features of the human training data and because of the nature of stereotypes and biases we communicate in our day-to-day communications. As most state-of-the-art MT systems handle translations on the sentence-level, gender phenomena are, usually, resolved on statistics inferred from the training data. Mistranslations of gender information occur more frequently when translating from gender-neutral languages, such as English, into morphological-rich languages, such as Italian or French, which explicitly mark gender and require additional information to correctly translate gender phenomena. When such additional information or context is not provided, the system will pick the most likely variant. A recent study by AUTHOR showed how Google Translate (GT) yields more male defaults than what ought to be expected when looking at demographic data on its own, alluding that there might be a phenomenon they refer to as machine bias AUTHOR. In this paper, we systematically evaluate: (a) single-word queries, containing personality adjectives and profession nouns, and (b) bigender nouns in an EN \rightarrow IT, FR, ES translation setting for GT, DeepL (DL) and Bing Microsoft Translator (BMT) to verify the diversity in translations provided by these MT providers.","In future work, we would like to conduct a larger evaluation comprising of more language pairs and a more diverse set of words. Furthermore, we aim to compile a challenge set focusing specifically on gender phenomena in language that can be used and automatically evaluated. We also envisage training our own state-of-the-art MT system to verify how and whether machine bias indeed influences the output of the translations generated.",21,Gender and Inclusive Language Studies

As prior work has been mostly experimented on English datasets, we focus on five different languages, and consider a setting where limited data are available. We investigate the effectiveness of non-gradient based augmentation methods, involving simple text span substitutions and syntactic manipulations. Our experiments show that (i) augmentation is effective in all cases, particularly for slot filling; and (ii) it is beneficial for a joint intent-slot model based on multilingual BERT, both for limited data settings and when full training data is used.","Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in task-oriented dialogue systems is responsible for parsing user utterances to extract the intent of the user and the arguments of the intent (i.e. slots) into a semantic representation, typically a semantic frame AUTHOR. For example, the utterance ``Play Jeff Pilson on Youtube"""" has the intent PlayMusic and Youtube as value for the slot Service. As more skills are added to the dialogue system, the NLU model frequently needs to be updated to scale to new domains and languages, a situation which typically becomes problematic when labeled data are limited (data scarcity). One way to combat data scarcity is through data augmentation (DA) techniques performing label preserving operations to produce auxiliary training data. Recently, DA has shown potential in tasks such as machine translation AUTHOR, constituency and dependency parsing AUTHOR, and text classification AUTHOR. As for slot filling (SF) and intent classification (IC), a number of DA methods have been proposed to generate synthetic utterances using sequence to sequence models AUTHOR, Conditional Variational Auto Encoder AUTHOR, or pre-trained NLG models AUTHOR. To date, most of the DA methods are evaluated on English and it is not clear whether the same finding apply to other languages. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of DA on several non-English datasets for NLU in task-oriented dialogue systems.

For MT, one of the most promising techniques to transfer knowledge is knowledge distillation. In this paper, we compare the different solutions to distill knowledge in a sequence-to-sequence task like ST. Moreover, we analyze eventual drawbacks of this approach and how to alleviate them maintaining the benefits in terms of translation quality.","Speech translation (ST) refers to the process of translating utterances in one language into text in a different language. Direct ST is an emerging paradigm that consists in translating without intermediate representations AUTHOR. It is a newer and alternative approach to cascade solutions AUTHOR, in which the input audio is first transcribed with an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and then the transcript is translated into the target language with a machine translation (MT) model. The rise of the direct ST paradigm is motivated by its theoretical and practical advantages, namely: i) during the translation phase it has access to information present in the audio that is lost in its transcripts (eg. prosody, characteristic of the speaker. For instance, the pitch of the voice is a cue for the sex of the speaker. Although the gender is a social aspect and does not depend on physical attributes, in many cases sex and gender coincide, so systems relying on this are likely to have a better accuracy than those that do not have access to any information regarding the speaker AUTHOR.), ii) there is no error propagation (in cascade systems the errors introduced by the ASR are propagated to the MT, which has no cues to recover them), iii) the latency is lower (as data flows through a single system instead of two), and iv) the management is easier (as there is a single model to maintain and no integration between separate modules is needed). On the downside, direct ST suffers from the lack of large ST training corpora. This problem has been addressed by researchers through transfer learning from the high-resource sub-tasks AUTHOR, multi-task trainings AUTHOR, and the proposal of data augmentation techniques AUTHOR. In this work, we focus on the transfer learning from MT. The classic approach consists in pre-training the decoder with that of an MT model. Its benefit, however, is controversial: indeed, AUTHOR showed that it is effective only with the addition of an adapter layer, but this has not been confirmed in AUTHOR, while in AUTHOR it always brought improvements. Another, more promising possibility consists in distilling knowledge from an MT model. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a knowledge transfer technique introduced for model compression AUTHOR. A small student model is trained computing the KL-divergence AUTHOR with the output probability distribution of a big teacher model. Although KD was introduced in the context of image processing, its effectiveness suggested its adoption in other fields. Specifically, AUTHOR showed that using an MT system as teacher brings significant improvements to direct ST models. However, they did not compare the different methods to distill knowledge in sequence-to-sequence models AUTHOR and they did not analyze possible negative effects of adopting this technique. In this paper, we analyze different sequence-to-sequence KD techniques (word level, sequence-level, sequence interpolation) and their combination in the context of direct ST. Then, we study the effect of the best technique on a strong system trained on a large amount of data to reach state-of-the-art results. We show that word-level KD is the best approach and that fine-tuning the resulting model without KD brings further improvements. Finally, we analyze the limitations and the problems present in models trained with KD, which are partly solved by the final finetuning.","We presented and analyzed the benefits and issues brought by distilling knowledge from an MT system for direct ST models. We compared the different KD techniques and our experiments indicated that the best training procedure consists in a pre-training with word-level KD and a fine-tuning without KD. Then, we showed that KD from MT models causes an increased gender bias, omission of sentences in multi-sentential utterances and more generic word/verbal-tense choices. Finally, we demonstrated that a fine-tuning helps resolving these issues, although the exacerbation of gender bias is not solved, but only alleviated.",10,Machine Translation

This paper discusses the application of the Universal Dependencies (UD) format to the syntactic annotation of a LIS corpus. This investigation aims in particular at contributing to sign language research by addressing the challenges that the visual-manual modality of LIS creates generally in linguistic annotation and specifically in segmentation and syntactic analysis. We addressed two case studies from the storytelling domain first segmented on the ELAN platform, and second syntactically annotated using CoNLL-U format.","The Italian Sign Language (LIS) is the natural language used by the Italian Deaf community. Signed languages have been extensively studied in the last years (Brentari, 2010). From a theoretical point of view, Signed languages are of interest to the linguistic domain since they are multi-channels natural languages, where the coexistence of different articulators (hands, face, lips, posture, feet, etc.) is the test-bed for the formalization of new linguistic theories or objects (e.g. (Huenerfauth, 2006)). From a practical point of view, there is a real necessity to design and realise automatic translators for Deaf communities (Bragg et al., 2019). We want to investigate LIS with the same means used for Vocal Languages (VL) and verify if, in doing so, LIS can be properly represented. In this context, language-specific strategies and resources should be developed. The reference framework in this work is the Universal Dependencies formalism (UD), a de facto standard for syntactic annotation. The main goals of this research are three. The first goal is theoretical. We want to investigate the expressiveness of UD tags and its relations with LIS. Signed languages have peculiar forms of lexicons and syntax and we want to experimentally verify the expressive power of the UD formalism in representing this richness. The second goal is theoretical as well. We want to determine the extent of the similarities and differences in syntactic constructions between Italian (as reported in the Italian-UD (Simi et al., 2014)), Swedish Sign Language (SSL, as reported in the SSL-UD treebank (Mesch and Schonstrom, 2018)) and LIS. At the present moment, the SSL is the only sign language that has been annotated on UD. The SSL treebank is comprised of 203 sentences taken from the Swedish Sign Language Corpus (SSLC) (Mesch and Schönström, 2018; Mesch and Wallin, 2015). Being the only reference for the construction of a treebank for a sign language, the SSL treebank was a fundamental resource for the choice of the direction to follow in the annotation of LIS, particularly with regard to the first step of the process, i.e. the segmentation on ELAN (see section 2.1). The third goal is more practical. We want to create a UD compliant resource for the syntactic annotation of LIS: the first LIS-UD treebank. To our knowledge, apart from the domain-specific bilingual corpus developed in the projects ATLAS and LIS4ALL on automatic translation (Mazzei et al., 2013; Geraci et al., 2014; Mazzei, 2015), this is the first attempt to use dependency relations for representing LIS syntax. For building the corpus, we selected two case studies in the storytelling domain: all of the sentences of two LIS videos, namely the fairy tale Cappuccetto Rosso (Little Red Riding Hood) and the story I tre fratelli (The three brothers, written by the Italian writer Grazia Deledda), were collected in the novel treebank that, at the moment, is comprised of 257 dependency trees. While in the Cappuccetto Rosso story the signer signs the story without an Italian reference text, in the I tre fratelli story the signer is translating from a well defined written Italian text. By using the full original version of these stories, we had to face the challenge represented by unrestricted real data. For instance, very long and complex sentences were annotated and translated into LIS. Considering the intrinsic complexity of the task and the novelty of the project, in the preliminary release of data described in this paper we only addressed some of the features of LIS. For instance, the location in space of a sign is only annotated in the portion of analysis carried out on ELAN but was not transferred in the CoNLL-U files. Furthermore, non-manual elements – which are one of the fundamental means used by LIS signers to convey meaning (Volterra, 2004)– are not included in any annotation layer developed in this project. This is the result of a lack of a more appropriate annotation strategy that is specific to sign languages within the UD framework, which is originally developed for the analysis of VLs and, by default, does not include the possibility to annotate the features of a language that go beyond the alphabetical construction of a word (or gloss, in this case). The paper is organized as follows. In the Section 2, the data collection and the morphological and syntactic annotation processes will be described. In Section 3, language-specific morphosyntactic phenomena are discussed mainly focusing on pointing signs as Highly Iconic Structures (henceforth HIS). The strategies used to annotate signs and their dependency relations are justified. Section 4 concludes the paper by providing some issue on the future development of the project.","The paper describes the development of the novel resource LIS-UD, namely a treebank for LIS in the UD format. Provided the preliminary stage of the project, the main aim of this work is to discuss the issues raised by the annotation in UD of a sign language. This issue has previously been only partially addressed in one other single project for the development of the SSL treebank, and so the novel resource can be the opportunity for better investigating it. Several future directions can be drawn for the development of our project. In particular, among these directions, we are planning first of all to draft a more detailed document about the annotation guidelines. This can help us in checking the material annotated until now, but also in driving the work of novel annotators.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We therefore developed CREENDER, an annotation tool to create multimodal datasets with images associated with semantic tags and comments, which we make freely available under Apache 2.0 license. The software has been extensively tested with school classes, allowing us to improve the tool and add useful features not planned in the first development phase.","In the last years, the NLP community has started to focus on the challenges of combining vision and language technologies, proposing approaches towards multimodal data processing AUTHOR. This has led to an increasing need of multimodal datasets with high-quality information to be used for training and evaluating the developed systems. While several datasets have been created by downloading and often adding textual annotation to real online data (see for example the Flickr dataset}), this poses privacy and copyright issues, since downloading and using pictures posted online without the author's consent is often forbidden by social network privacy policies. Instagram terms of use, for example, explicitly forbid collecting information in an automated way without express permission from the platform.. In order to address this issue, we present CREENDER, a novel annotation tool to create multimodal datasets of images and comments. With this tool it is possible to simulate a scenario where different users access the platform and are displayed different pictures, having the possibility to leave a comment and associate a semantic tag to the image. The same pictures can be shown to different users, allowing a comparison of their comments and online behaviour. CREENDER can be used in contexts where simulated scenarios are the only solution to collect datasets of interest. One typical example, which we detail in Section annotproc, is the analysis of the online behaviour of teenagers and young adults, a task that poses relevant privacy issues since underage users are targeted. Giving the possibility to comment images in an Instagram-like setting without giving any personal information to register is indeed of paramount importance, and can be easily achieved with the tool presented in this paper. Given its flexibility, CREENDER can however be used for any task where images need to be tagged and/or commented, and multiple annotations of the same image should be preferably collected.","In this work we present a methodology and a tool, CREENDER, to create multimodal datasets. In this framework, participants in online annotation sessions can write comments to images, assign pre-defined categories or simply skipping an image. The tool is freely available with an interface in three languages, and allows setting up easily annotation sessions with multiple users. CREENDER has been extensively tested during activities with schools around the topic of cyberbullying, involving 95 Italian high-school students. The tool is particularly suitable for this kind of settings, where privacy issues are of paramount importance and the involvement of underage people requires that personal information is not shared. In the future, we plan to continue the annotation of images related to cyberbullying, creating and comparing subsets of pictures related to different topics (e.g. religious symbols, political parties, football teams). From an implementation point of view, we will extend the analytics panel, adding for example scripts for computing inter-annotator agreement.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

One of the bottlenecks for current research on DAs is the lack of publicly available resources with DA annotation. While this is true also for English, it is even more important for languages with fewer resources, such as Italian. For Italian, the only publicly available resource with DA annotation is currently the iLISTEN corpus AUTHOR, released for EVALITA in 2018. While useful, this resource relies on an annotation scheme which assumes only one single DA per conversational turn (see Figure). However, ISO 24617-2 AUTHOR, the latest accepted standard for DA annotation, posits that conversational turns can be multifunctional in a sequential way, i.e. speakers' turns can be composed of multiple DAs in sequence AUTHOR.

The contributions of this paper are: (1) we create iLISTEN2ISO, to the best of our knowledge the first publicly available resource with DA annotation in Italian which uses a multifunctional approach and is ISO-standard compliant; (2) we present an analysis of iLISTEN2ISO showing the importance of multifunctional DA annotation; (3) we propose baseline DA tagging models for Italian trained on iLISTEN (achieving, to the best of our knowledge, SOTA results) and iLISTEN2ISO.","We presented iLISTEN2ISO, a resource for Italian multifunctional DA tagging using ISO 24617-2. We argued the importance to consider turns as a composition of multiple communicative functions, in order to preserve important semantic information. Moreover, we presented different baseline DA tagging models, on both iLISTEN and iLISTEN2ISO. We believe the presented resource could be useful to the research community for experimenting with multifunctional DA tagging in Italian, as well as cross-corpora DA tagging. As future work, we plan to explore joint DA segmentation and classification in Italian, for example taking inspiration from the work presented by Zhao and Kawahara (2019).",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

We first collected a new dataset for such domain. Then, we compared the results obtained by two different systems, one including a Support Vector Machine and one with BERT. For the first one, we linguistic pre–processed the dataset to extract hand-crafted features exploited by the classifier. For the second one, we oversampled the dataset to achieve better results. Our results show that the SVMbased system, without the worry of having to oversample, has better performance than the BERT-based one, achieving an F1-score of 91.21%.","Nowadays, when people want to buy a product or service, they often rely on online reviews of other buyers/users (think of online sales giants like Amazon). Likewise, patients are increasingly relying on reviews on social media, blogs and forums to choose a hospital where to be cured. This behaviour is occurring not only abroad (Greaves et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2012), but also in Italy. This is also demonstrated by the increasing amount of reviews in QSalute1 , one of the most popular Italian ranking websites in healthcare. These reviews are often ignored by hospital companies, which do not exploit the potential of such data to understand patients’ experiences and consequently improve their services. Due to the large amount of data, there is a need for automatic analysis techniques. To meet these needs, we decided to introduce a sentiment analysis system based on machine learning techniques, in order to classify whether a review has positive or negative sentiment. Since such systems require annotated data, the first step was to build a brand-new dataset. We present it in the next section. Then, we developed two systems based on two different classifiers described in Section 3 together with the features extracted from the text. In Sections 4 and 5 we show the experiments conducted during this study, the obtained results and their discussion. Finally, the last section provides concluding remarks and some possible future developments. While there exist several works on affective computing in several domains for the Italian language (Basile et al., 2018; Cignarella et al., 2018; Barbieri et al., 2016), at the time we are writing there are no references in literature that address this particular domain in Italian. Thus, for the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of sentiment analysis on Italian reviews in healthcare.","In this paper, we have introduced a novel system for sentiment analysis for Italian reviews in Healthcare. For the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of this kind in such domain. To do so, we have collected the first dataset for this domain from the web. Then, we have implemented and compared two types of classifiers of the state of the art for such task, the SVM and BERT. Despite the strong dataset imbalance, we have obtained very good results, especially with the SVMbased system, which outperformed the BERTbased one, while maintaining a low computational burden during training. However, there is a chance that increasing the maximum sequence length of BERT it may outperform our best-developed system. Also, recent work (Nozza et al., 2020) has analyzed the contribution of language-specific models, showing in general improvements over BERT multilingual for a wide variety of NLP tasks. For this reason, it might be worth including in future works the use of specific models for Italian, such as GilBERTo6 , UmBERTo7 , and AlBERTo8 . The latter was already used for a sentiment classification task (Polignano et al., 2019). Future works on this dataset may also tackle the task of sentiment classification including the neutral class or sentiment regression of the average scores. Moreover, future research may tackle the task of cataloguing reviews to the area of disease they belong, maybe including other features from metadata such as titles.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The main features of the resource, such as POS-pattern and lemma distribution, are also discussed, together with possible applications.","The computational treatment of multiword expressions (henceforth, MWEs) is notoriously a major challenge in NLP AUTHOR. In the last decades, the (computational) linguistics community has dedicated many efforts to the development of techniques for the (semi-)automatic identification and extraction of MWEs from corpora and the consequent creation of resources, such as gold standard lists of MWEs, which are needed for evaluation tasks or machine learning training. This notwithstanding, the availability of such resources is still quite limited compared with “the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of MWEs” AUTHOR, especially for `non-mainstream' languages like Italian. With this work, we contribute to this line of research by providing a dataset of 1,682 validated Italian multiword expressions, obtained through the manual annotation of candidates automatically extracted from corpora of written Italian within the CombiNet project AUTHOR. The dataset is to be intended as a first release that will be enriched in the future. We describe our methodology in Section~sec:method, while in Section~sec:results we report on preliminary analyses carried out with respect to MWE features and distribution.","The sequences contained in this release are obviously quite heterogeneous. Semantically speaking, some are very idiomatic in meaning (e.g. braccio di ferro ‘arm wrestling’, colpo di scena ‘coup de théâtre’, mandare in onda ‘to broadcast’), some other (much) less so (e.g. prendere le distanze ‘to distance (oneself)’, andare in pensione ‘to retire’, di servizio ‘service (adj.)’), their specialty lying more in their familiar, conventional status (e.g. sapere benissimo ‘to know (damn) well’, essere favorevole ‘to be in favour’, nella storia ‘in history’). Still others may have more than one meaning, with different degrees of figurativity (e.g. mettere in scena, which can mean both ‘to stage’ and ‘to enact’). From a formal point of view, some look rather fixed and do not admit lexical insertion (e.g. vero e proprio ‘proper’) or inflection (e.g. tra l’altro ‘by the way’, ordine del giorno ‘agenda’), whereas others seem more flexible (e.g. essere certo ‘to be sure’, andare bene ‘to be OK, to go well’, posto di lavoro ‘workplace’). MWE variability is one aspect that we did not address here but definitely deserves to be investigated more thoroughly (cf. e.g. (Nissim and Zaninello, 2011)). In fact, some MWEs may exhibit different behaviour and even completely different meanings according to their grammatical form, like, for example, a suo tempo ‘in due course’ (lit. in his/her time) vs. ai suoi tempi ‘in his/her time’ (lit. in his/her times). Being based on lemmatized forms, our study does not currently account for such form differences. Moreover, our study is based on contiguous sequences, therefore discontinuous or topicalized occurrences are not accounted for. We also aim at broadening this initial list by exploring more candidates from the CombiNet data, which are obviously still rich of relevant material. This first release, although limited, is meaningful since it is the first list of commonly used MWEs available for the Italian language, except for domain-specific resources such as PANACEA (Frontini et al., 2012). Although lexicographic material is now accessible for Italian lexical combinatorics (see e.g. (Lo Cascio, 2013)), usagebased and freely available lists of MWEs are still missing and much needed, both for computational tasks and for applied (lexicographic and language teaching related) purposes.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

However, such embeddings are usually trained on generic corpora, while text classification tasks are often domain-specific. We propose a fully automated method to adapt pre-trained word embeddings to any given classification task, that needs no additional resource other than the original training set. The method is based on the concept of word weirdness, extended to score the words in the training set according to how characteristic they are with respect to the labels of a text classification dataset. The polarized weirdness scores are then used to update the word embeddings to reflect task-specific semantic shifts. Our experiments show that this method is beneficial to the performance of several text classification tasks in different languages.","In recent years, the Natural Language Processing community has directed a great deal of effort towards text classification, in different declinations. The list of shared tasks proposed at the recent editions (2016–2019) of the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) shows an increasing number of tasks that can be cast as text classification problems: given a text and a set of labels, choose the correct label to associate with the text. If the cardinality of the set of labels is two, we speak of binary classification, as opposed to multiclass classification. Furthermore, not all binary classification tasks are the same. When the labels indicate the presence or absence of a given phenomenon, we speak of a detection task. Classification tasks are mainly approached in a supervised fashion, where a labeled dataset is employed to train a classifier to map certain features of the input text to the probability of a certain label. Arguably, the most useful features in a NLP problem are the words that compose the text. However, in order to be processed by a machine learning algorithm, words need to be represented in a dense and machine readable format. Word embeddings solve this issue by providing vectorial representations of words where vectors that are close in the geometric space represent words that occur often in the same contexts. Among their applications, pre-trained word embeddings are a powerful source of knowledge to boost the performance of supervised models that aim at learning from textual instances. Several deep learning models compute word embeddings at training time. However, they can be initialized with pre-trained word embeddings, typically computed on the basis of concordances in large corpora. This kind of initialization not only boosts the training of the model, but it also represents a way of injecting precomputed world knowledge into a model otherwise trained on a (sometimes very specific) data set. An issue with word embedding models, including recent contextual embeddings such as Peters et al. (2018), is that they are typically trained on general-purpose corpora. Therefore, they may fail to capture semantic shifts that occur in specific domains. For instance, in a dataset of online hate speech, negatively charged words such as insults often co-occur with words that would normally be considered neutral, but carry instead a negative signal in that particular context. More concretely, in a dataset of hate speech towards immigrant in the post-Trump U.S., a word that otherwise would be considered neutral such as wall carries a definite negative connotation. In this work, we try to capture this intuition computationally, and model this phenomenon in a word embedding space. We employ an automatic measure to score words in a labeled corpus according to their association with a given label (Section 3.1) and use this score in a fully automated method to adapt generic pre-trained word embeddings (Section 3.2). We test our method on existing benchmarks of hate speech detection (Section 4.1) and gender prediction (Section 4.2), reporting improvements in precision and recall.","In this work, we adapted an extension of the weirdness index to score the words in a labeled corpus according to how much they are typical of a given label. The polarized weirdness score is used to automatically adapt an existing word embedding space to better reflect target-specific semantic associations of words. We measured a performance boost on tasks of hate speech detection in English and Spanish, and gender prediction in Italian. On detection tasks, the improvement from our method is remarkable in terms of recall, indicating the potential of weirdness-adapted word embeddings to correct false negatives. This result is in line with the original motivation for this approach, i.e., to account for semantic shift occurring in domain-specific corpora of opinionated content. For instance, in the hate speech domain, the adapted embeddings are able to capture that certain neutral words (e.g., “wall”) assume a polarized connotation (e.g., negatively charged). The results from this study are promising, and encourage us to extend the method to richer representations (e.g., “weird” ngrams), languages other than European, and its integration into more sophisticated deep neural models. Recent Transformer models, in particular, compute contextualized embeddings, therefore including transformations similar to the present method. Although such models are less transparent with respect to such transformation, an experimental comparison is among the next steps planned in this research.",1,Language Models

The use of neural architectures for the generation of Counter Narratives (CNs) is beginning to be investigated by the NLP community. Still, the efforts were solely targeting English. In this paper, we try to fill the gap for Italian, studying how to implement CN generation approaches effectively. We experiment with an existing dataset of CNs and a novel language model, recently released for Italian, under several configurations, including zero and few shot learning. Results show that even for under-resourced languages, data augmentation strategies paired with large unsupervised LMs can held promising results.","The rise of online Hate Speech (HS) brings along the need for combating strategies as it can trigger harmful psychological effects on the target groups and more crimes against them. While research studies have been widely focusing on hate speech detection methodologies for social media platforms AUTHOR, a recent line of research has taken the problem a step further by addressing the automatic generation of counter responses, aka counter narratives AUTHOR, in order to assist non-governmental organizations in their real-world online hatred combating efforts. An example of HS along with a possible CN are shown below: HS: Gli arabi sono tutti terroristi e vogliono conquistarci con la violenza e le bombe. Bisogna rispondere con il napalm. [Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with violence and bombs. We must respond with napalm.] CN: Essere di origine araba non significa essere terroristi, evitiamo generalizzazioni che portano solo ad altro odio. [Being of Arab descent does not mean being a terrorist, let's avoid generalizations that only lead to more hatred.] Despite the encouraging results of the counter narrative generation task, experiments have been limited to English due to the scarcity of hate speech / counter narrative data in other languages. In this paper, we investigate counter narrative generation for Italian as a case study where zero or only a small amount of task specific in-language data is available. We first explore the portability of generation across languages, considering that recent neural machine translation (NMT) systems have shown outstanding performances. We propose utilizing off-the-shelf NMT models to synthesize silver data from other languages, and fine-tuning AUTHOR, a recently developed GPT-2 based language model for Italian, on the silver data. We then examine the effect of combining silver with gold data on CN generation by experimenting with various gold data sizes. Our findings show that a proper combination of silver and gold data while fine-tuning LMs can drastically reduce the need for expert-annotator effort on target languages.","Counter narrative generation using neural architectures is beginning to be studied for hatred intervention. In this paper, we presented the first attempt of CN generation for Italian, investigating several variations of generation when gold data is limited or not available. Our experiments reveal that with simple data augmentation strategies paired with powerful LMs can bring promising results for under-resourced languages. As future work we plan to explore methods for improving specificity via the use of diverse types of knowledge (e.g., facts, events and named entities) from external resources. This would also mitigate the problem of the model possibly generating hallucinated content (i.e. non-existent or wrong content), see for example (Maynez et al., 2020; Nie et al., 2019). Finally, we plan to apply this approach to other hate phenomena such as antisemitism, homophobia, and misogyny.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The variation across the thresholds may have an opposite impact on the prediction of negative and positive polarity. We hypothesize that this may be due to asymmetries in the data or in the lexicon, or both. We carry out therefore experiments for evaluating the effect of lexicon and of the topics addressed in the data. Our experiments are based on a weighted version of the Italian linguistic resource MAL (Morphologicallyinflected Affective Lexicon) by using as weighting corpus TWITA, a large-scale corpus of messages from Twitter in Italian. The novel Weighted-MAL (W-MAL), presented for the first time int this paper, achieved better polarity classification results especially for negative tweets, along with alleviating the aforementioned polarity imbalance.","Sentiment Analysis (SA) is the task of Natural Language Processing that aims at extracting opinions from natural language expressions, e.g., reviews or social media posts. The basic approaches to SA typically fall into one of two categories: dictionary-based and supervised machine learning. Methods based on a dictionary make use of affective lexicons, language resources where each word or lemma is associated to a score indicating its affective valence (e.g., polarity). In SA they are faster than supervised statistical approaches and require minimal adaptation, unless the resource is domain-specific, also when applied to multiple environments with minimal adaptation overhead. However, they only achieve good performance for identifying coarse opinion tendencies in large datasets, since they cannot take into account the impact of the context on the polarity value associated to a word. Supervised statistical methods, on the other hand, tend to provide better quality predictions across benchmarks, due to their better ability to generalize over individual words and expressions, and learning higher level features. These models also show a better ability to adapt to specific domains, provided the availability of data suitable for training. In order to access the lexical entries in an affective dictionary, lemmatization must be performed on each single word. Unfortunately, lemmatization is an error-prone process, with potentially negative impact on the performance of downstream tasks such as SA. Vassallo et al. (2019) introduced a novel computational linguistic resource, namely the Morphologically-inflected Affective Lexicon (henceforth MAL) in order to address this issue by avoiding the lemmatization step in favor of a morphologically rich affective resource. In the experiments we carried out on a specific text genre, namely social media, we have observed that using a threshold to assign polarity classes is beneficial, and using the MAL instead of a lemmatization step improves the SA performance overall, in particular due to a better prediction of the negative polarity. However, the variation in threshold has opposite impact on the prediction of negative and positive tweets. In this paper, we investigate the motivation beyond this polarity imbalance. In particular, we speculate that this may be due to asymmetries in the data (e.g., different internal topics), in the lexicon (e.g., different amounts of negative and positive terms), or both, and we provide experiments to better understand this result and validate these hypotheses. We can therefore summarize as follows our research questions: i) Is the polarity imbalance due to the topic addressed? ii) Is the polarity imbalance due to the lexicon (i.e., the resources we used, Sentix and MAL)? iii) Is the polarity imbalance due to both? A further contribution of the paper consists in providing a statistical method for finding the threshold for using the lexicon in SA tasks. The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, affective lexicons and the resource MAL are discussed. In section 3, we describe the issues related to polarity imbalance in lexicon-based approaches for SA. The fourth section is instead devoted to discuss the impact on SA of lexicon and to introduce W-MAL. Section 5 discusses how the topics addressed in the text may impact ob SA. The final section provides conclusive remarks and some hints about future work.","The weighting scheme proposed in this work is a promising solution to the polarity imbalance in dictionary-based SA. The experiments show that weighting the polarity scores with word frequencies yielded a more precise prediction of the polarized tweets, with lessened bias in the thresholds for neutral scores. The novel resource here presented, W-MAL, is an attempt to better characterize the most sought-after words, which have an impact on the interaction between sentiment and topic. We believe it also represents a promising attempt to control for context-dependency while using lexicon-based methods for SA. In particular, with this resource we try to give voice to the linguistic intuition that the exploitation of a specific form within a message might meaningfully impact on the sentiment expressed in the message. For instance, referring to the top example in figure 2, by exploiting the subjunctive mood ”confondesse” of the verb ”confondere” (to confuse), the author joins together with the meaning of the verb also a sense of doubtfulness and of unreality. This is also improved by the fact that this form introduces a clause which is coordinated with the clause headed by a verb in conditional mood, i.e. ”sarebbe” (form of to be). This form of the verb ”confondere” seems especially adequate for contexts where a negative polarity is expressed and less appropriate for other cases. The use of this specific mood for the verb has therefore a meaningful impact on the sentiment expressed. The MAL properly encodes this information, which may be lost when a lemmatization step is applied on text and all forms are subsequently considered as bearing the same meaning without further nuances. But the W-MAL does also better: it encodes the probabilistic information about how suitable a form is for expressing a particular sentiment with respect to other available forms in a given context. For all the aforementioned reasons, this work has drawn our attention to the necessity of weighting the dictionary-based affective lexicons to SA with corpora-based word frequencies. The resource is freely available at URL In future work, we plan on working on more refined weighting strategies, e.g., leveraging the frequency information of word forms in addition to lemmas, and taking the topic distribution into consideration. Reducing the computation load is a challenging goal as well (see Prakash et al. (2015)). On the other hand, modern transformerbased models have reached state-of-the-art results on the task of polarity detection (Polignano et al., 2019), although they are far more expensive and time- consuming to run. We plan therefore to compare the predictions of these systems, and study ways to integrate their respective strengths (i.e., speed and transparency of the dictionary-based approach vs. the superior prediction capability of the deep neural models) in order to boost the overall performance. The present work was originally conceived in the framework of the AGRItrend project led by the CREA Research Centre for Agricultural Policies and Bio-economy, aiming at collecting and analyzing social media data for opinions in the domain of public policies and agriculture. As such, we plan on studying the impact of the techniques presented in this paper on that particular domain, and observe if the same, or different, patterns emerge. On a similar line, so far we conducted experiments on data from Twitter, which facilitates access to large quantity of data but restricts the range of text style and genre found in them.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

O'Brien",0,0,"Singapore, Italy","Singapore, Genova","It is widely held that children implicitly learn the structure of their writing system through statistical learning of spelling-to-sound mappings. Yet an unresolved question is how to sequence reading experience so that children can ‘pick up’ the structure optimally. We tackle this question here using a computational model of encoding and decoding. The order of presentation of words was manipulated so that they exhibited two distinct progressions of granularity of spelling-to-sound mappings. We found that under a training regime that introduced written words progressively from small-to-large granularity, the network exhibited an early advantage in reading acquisition as compared to a regime introducing written words from large-to-small granularity. Our results thus provide support for the grain size theory AUTHOR and demonstrate that the order of learning can influence learning trajectories of literacy skills.","Reading science provides evidence of the developmental path to acquiring reading for alphabetic languages AUTHOR. From parsing the speech stream into words in infancy AUTHOR, to familiarizing with print in the preschool years AUTHOR --- these activities lead to the accrual of key knowledge for learning to read. Knowledge about the language’s phonotactic and graphotactic properties and symbolic representations with abstract letter units is necessary for the forthcoming insight that print represents spoken language (the alphabetic principle). Subsequent to this insight, children are ready to take on the process of learning the precise mapping of print-to-speech. At its basis, learning to read involves learning to decode a script into oral language representations. The question arises as to the optimal input for learning this orthography-to-phonology mapping in an alphabetic system, especially for languages that have deep orthographies, such as English. Shallow orthographies (e.g., Finnish, Spanish) have a more precise match between letters and sounds; whereas deep orthographies match phonemes to graphemes (one or more letters) in an inconsistent way --- with multiple spellings per phoneme, or multiple pronunciations per grapheme --- and, thus, have a greater number of GPCs (grapheme-phoneme correspondences). Therefore, reading acquisition is found to occur at a comparatively slower rate for readers in deep as compared to shallow orthographies AUTHOR. The deep orthographic complexity of English also partly results from variation in the functional units of the writing system --- graphemes –-- which may consist of a single letter (e.g., a), or multiple letters (e.g., ay, aye). While skilled adult readers have unitized these subword patterns AUTHOR, beginning readers need to acquire these patterns of graphemes and their mappings to phonemes. Here we consider this mapping problem along two dimensions: (1) the granularity of the units of analysis to be picked up at any given time; and (2) the ordering of learning such units and types. A fruitful approach to examining the GPC learning process is through computational modelling AUTHOR. Specifically, connectionist models are sensitive to the timing and ordering of learning events, in that they learn incrementally. This feature is particularly apt for modeling reading development, as it affords simulating the incremental nature of a child learning to read new words daily, as schooling progresses. Order effects as well as frequency trajectory effects have been documented in previous connectionist models AUTHOR, and here we are interested in comparing learning trajectories for particular training orderings for reading development. To this end, we present connectionist networks with small batches of words, which we test regularly for accuracy until a given criterion across the batch is achieved --- in essence, an adaptive training regime. Using this approach, we can address long-standing issues in the area of reading education with a more systematic approach to understanding how print-to-speech mappings are learned AUTHOR. Below we briefly review why print-to-speech decoding can be a hard problem, both for learners and for researchers trying to understand its mechanisms. Then, we discuss dimensions of granularity derived from the literature, and offer a first set of connectionist simulations of the order of reading acquisition of American English.","As the process of learning to read requires picking up and internalizing representational units of print associated with sound, the ordering of training input to the reading system becomes paramount. How best to order input and maximize learning efficiency has been debated in the literacy education field. This study capitalizes on a computational modelling approach to this issue, using a highly controlled context without the ethical concerns of human learning studies. Directly contrasting the effects of two literacy training regimes differing in granularity order, the simulation results support better learning with smaller, less complex orthographic units, as predicted from corpus-based research (Vousden, 2008). At training stages comprising of 3015 words, we found that the model initially trained with words of smaller granularity performed and generalized to pseudo-words better than the model trained with larger granularity. The LS model did require significantly more training epochs to reach the same performance as the SL model. Essentially, when children learn to read, they must navigate the structure of their language and its writing system. Granularity and consistency are important aspects of this structure, and both impact reading performance. Adult readers are slower to identify letters within a multi-letter grapheme (Smith and Monaghan, 2011; Rey et al., 2000), suggesting that graphemes are functional reading units. Furthermore, Rastle and Coltheart (1998) found that naming latencies were slower for pseudo-words with, as compared to without, multi-letter graphemes. Adult word naming and lexical decision are also faster for consistent words (Andrews, 1982; Jared, 1997; Jared, 2002), and consistent words are more accurately read and spelled by children (Alegria and Mousty, 1996; Lété et al., 2008; Weekes et al., 2006). Granularity and consistency have been regarded to be associated (Treiman et al., 1995), and our corpus analysis revealed this as well — monosyllabic English words of smaller granularity tend to be more consistent than words with larger granularity. This relationship indicates that granularity and consistency may not be entirely disentangled, at least for English. With this in mind, the SL model was first exposed to words of smaller granularity that were also more consistent in their GPC and PGC (phoneme-grapheme correspondence) mappings. Thus consistency and granularity may be two sides of the same coin, and when manipulated they could lead to faster or slower rates of convergence. Importantly, the current model included bidirectional links between orthographic and phonological units, simulating the real-world scenario that children acquire decoding and encoding skills simultaneously. These findings have implications for educational planning for early literacy. In particular, our pilot simulation provides preliminary evidence on the potential utility of manipulating the order of training in terms of word granularity to unveil facilitative effects on literacy acquisition. Reading instruction can consider the early acquisition of words with smaller granularity, or more consistency. However, we note that the present findings are based on the analysis of monosyllabic words only and should not be generalized to multisyllabic words directly. Future work can consider using models that are capable of reading multisyllabic words (Perry et al., 2010), or explore the link between granularity and consistency across languages that are either less or more orthographically transparent.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In this frame, Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) have pointed to referring as a collaborative process, that requires action and coordination by both speakers and interlocutors, and that needs to be studied with a collaborative model. Clark and WilkesGibbs (1986), in fact, have highlighted that – in order to refer to an object in the world – speakers must believe that the referent is mutually identifiable to them and their addressees. This is an important skill that human speakers leverage to succeed in communication. However, humans are not only able to identify an object described by the interlocutor – that is, grounding a referring expression – but also to understand that such an object is not in the scene and, therefore, it cannot be grounded. It can happen, indeed, that a referent is not mutually identifiable by the speakers, due to the speakers being in different grounding conditions. In this case, the addressee is able to disconfirm a description stated by the interlocutor by communicating that he/she does not see it (as in Figure 1). This is a crucial skill of human speakers. However, it is often neglected in the computational modelling of conversational agents. We conjecture that the participants’ visual grounding conditions have an impact on the linguistic form and structure of their utterances. If confirmed, our hypothesis would lead to the claim that mature AI dialogue systems should learn to master their language with the flexibility shown by humans. In particular, their language use should differ when the referred object is mutually identifiable or not. It has been shown that current AI multimodal systems are not able to decide if a visual question is answerable or not (Bhattacharya et al., 2019), and they fail to identify whether the entity to which an expression refer is present in the visual scene or not (Shekhar et al., 2017b; Shekhar et al., 2017a). We believe models can acquire this skill if they learn to play the “language game” properly. In this paper, we investigate how the language of human conversational partners changes when they are in a mutually grounded (they both see the image they are speaking about) or non-mutually grounded setting (one sees the image while the other does not). We find that, indeed, there are statistically significant differences along various linguistic dimensions, including utterance length, parts of speech, and the degree of concreteness of the words used. Moreover, a simple SVM classifier based on these same features is shown to be able to distinguish between the two conditions with a relatively high performance.","Our findings confirm that, in a visually-grounded dialogue, different linguistic strategies are employed by speakers based on different grounding conditions. Our statistical analyses reliably indicate that several aspects of the language used in the conversation mirror whether the referred image is – or not – mutually shared by the interlocutors. Moreover, the effectiveness of a simple featurebased classifier to distinguish between the two followers’ conditions further indicates that the language used by the speakers differs along several dimensions. We believe this capability of humans to flexibly tune their language underpins their success in communication. We suggest that efforts should be put in developing conversational AI systems that are capable to master language with a similar flexibility. This could be achieved, for example, by exposing models to one or the other condition during training to encourage them encode the relevant linguistic features. Alternatively, they should first understand whether the grounded information which is referred to is available to them or not. These are open challenges that we plan to tackle in future work.",13,Multimodal

We therefore present an evaluation of hate speech detection in Italian using machine-translated data from English and comparing three settings, in order to understand the impact of training size, class distribution and annotation scheme.","The task of detecting hate speech on social media has been attracting increasing attention due to the negative effects this phenomenon can have on online communities and society as a whole. The development of systems which can effectively detect hate speech has therefore become increasingly important for academics and tech companies alike. One of the difficulties of producing accurate hate speech detection systems is the need for large, high-quality datasets, the creation of which is time and resource-consuming. English can count on the highest number of hate speech detection datasets, as well as the ones with the largest sizes, with up to 150k posts for a single dataset AUTHOR. Other languages such as Italian, on the other hand, can count on fewer datasets which tend to be smaller AUTHOR. Given that machine learning methods are typically used for this task, the use of small datasets can lead to overfitting problems due to the lack of linguistic variation AUTHOR. One possible solution to alleviate data sparseness is the use of machine translated data from English to less resourced languages for training classifiers, exploiting the large amount of data available for English. This has already been used in the context of hate speech detection AUTHOR but results have not been consistent across languages. An additional issue is the fact that there is no shared fixed definition within the NLP community of what type of language constitutes hate speech. Indeed, there are typically large differences among hate speech and abusive language datasets in terms of annotation frameworks and their applications in practice AUTHOR. In addition to this, there can be large variations between datasets in terms of size and class balance. Possible issues affecting the behaviour of classifiers trained on machine-translated data, such as different class distribution in source and target language, or different annotation scheme, have not been analysed. In order to fill this gap, we explore the impact of these differences between datasets when performing hate speech detection in Italian using machine-translated data from English. %In particular, we investigate the impact these characteristics have on a system trained on machine-translated data. Our goal is to address the three following questions: i) What performance can we expect by using only machine translated data, given that translation quality for social media language may be problematic? ii) Is it better to use a larger translated set for training, even by merging slightly different classes, or a smaller, more precise one? iii) What is the impact of class imbalance, and to what extent can undersampling be effective? The above questions are addressed by comparing three experimental settings that are described in Section sec:exper and evaluated in Section sec:results.","In this paper we analysed the impact of machine-translated data on Italian hate speech detection in a zero-shot setting. Our experiments show that when using machine-translated data for training it is possible to learn a classification model that clearly outperforms the most-frequent baseline, even if translation quality is affected by the jargon used in social media data. We found that using more task-specific data can have a positive impact on classification performance even with lower sample sizes compared to larger, less targeted datasets. Consistency in class distribution of training and test data can have a bigger impact than the size of the training set, or the annotation scheme. Indeed, using only the original training set translated into Italian, without undersampling, classification performance would be poor. In the future, we plan to extend this kind of evaluation to new language pairs and new datasets, to check whether the findings obtained on the English – Italian pair are confirmed also with other languages.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

In particular, we will study the role that a linguistically sound NLG architecture can have in a DS. Using real examples from a new corpus of dialogue in customer-care domain, we will study how the non-linguistic contextual data can be exploited by using NLG.","In this paper we present the first results of an ongoing project on the design of a dialogue system for customer care in the telco field. In most of the dialogue systems (DSs), the generation side of the communication is quite limited to the use of templates AUTHOR. Templates are pre-compiled sentences with empty slots that can be filled with appropriate fillers. Most of commercial DSs, following the classical cascade architecture NLUnderstanding, DialogueManager, NLGeneration AUTHOR, use machine learning-based Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques to identify important concepts (e.g., intent and entities in AUTHOR) that will be used by the dialogue manager (i) to update the state of the system and (ii) to produce the next dialogue act AUTHOR, possibly filling the slots in the generation templates. This classical, and quite common, information flow/architecture for dialogue processing has, as a working hypothesis, the assumption that most of necessary information is provided by the user's utterance: we call this information linguistic channel (L-channel). However, especially in the customer-care domain, this assumption is only partially true. For instance, in the sentence ``Scusami ma vorrei sapere come mai mi vengono fatti certi addebiti?'' (``Excuse me, I'd like to know why I'm charged certain fees?''), even a very advanced NLU module can produce only a vague information about the user's request to the DialogueManager. Indeed, in order to provide good enough responses, the DialogueManager resorts to other two sources of information: the domain context channel (DC-channel) and the user model channel (UM-channel). The DC-channel is fundamental to produce the content of the answer, while the UM-channel is necessary to give also the correct form. It is worth noting that both channels, that are often neglected in the design of commercial DSs for customer-care domain, have central roles in the design of (linguistically sound) natural language generation (NLG) systems AUTHOR. In particular, considering the standard architecture for data-to-text NLG systems AUTHOR, the analysis of the DC-channel exactly corresponds to the content selection task and the UM-channel influences both the sentence planning and sentence realization phases. In other words, the central claims of this paper are that in commercial DSs for customer care: (1) L-channel is often not informative enough and one needs to use the DC-channel and the UM-channel for producing a sufficiently good answer, (2) DC-channel and UM-channel can be exploited by using standard symbolic in neural networks deters their use in real-world NLG AUTHOR NLG techniques and methods}. The remainder of the paper supports both of these claims while presenting our ongoing project on the development of a rule-based NLG prototype to be used in a customer care domain. Section sec::corpus presents the corpus developed in the first stage of this project, consisting of real dialogues containing explanation requests in telco customer-care domain. Section sec::nlg presents an NLG architecture for managing the L-DC-UM channels that can be adopted in a DS for customer care. Finally, Section sec::conclusion concludes the paper with few remarks on the current state of the project and on future work.","In this paper we have discussed the main features of the design of a DS system for telco customer care. In particular, we outlined the peculiarities of this domain, describing the construction of a specifically-designed dialogue corpus and discussing a possible integration of standard DS and NLG architectures in order to manage these peculiarities. This is an ongoing project and we are considering various enhancements: (1) we will integrate emoji prediction capabilities into the proposed architecture in order to allow the DS to automatically attach an appropriate emoji at the end of the generated response, relying on previous work for Italian (Ronzano et al., 2018); we would also take into account the current user emotions, while generating an appropriate emoji – it may be the case that an emoji that is adequate when the conversation is characterized by a neutral tone, suddenly becomes inappropriate if the user is frustrated or angry (Pamungkas, 2019; Cercas Curry and Rieser, 2019); (2) we would like to enhance the system so as to adapt the generated responses to other aspects of the users, such as their mental models, levels of domain expertise, and personality traits; (3) we want to evaluate the DS following the user-based comparative schema adopted in (Demberg et al., 2011). Finally, we add some closing remarks on the corpus availability and its anonymization. The publication of a dataset of conversations between customers and a company virtual assistant is a great opportunity for the company and for its surrounding communities of academics, designers, and developers. However, it entails a number of obstacles to overcome. Rules and laws by regulating bodies must be strictly followed – see, for example, the GDPR regulation. This means, first of all, including within the to-be-published dataset only those conversations made by customers who have given their consent to this type of treatment of their data. Moreover, it is mandatory to obscure both personal and sensitive customer data. Such obfuscation activities are particularly difficult in the world of chatbots, where customers are free to input unrestricted text in the conversations. Regular expressions can be used in order to recognize the pieces of data to be obscured, such as email addresses, telephone numbers, social security numbers, bank account identifiers, dates of birth, etc. More sophisticated techniques needed be adopted to identify and obscure, within the text entered by customers, names, surnames, home and work addresses. Even more complex and open is the problem of anonymizing sensitive customer data. For example, consider the case of a disabled customer who reveals his/her sanitary condition to the virtual assistant, in order to obtain a legitimate better treatment from the company: the text revealing the health condition of the customer must be obscured. Other relevant sensitive data include racial or ethnic origins, religious or philosophical beliefs, political opinions, etc. Some of these techniques, used for identifying certain types of data to be obscured, have a certain degree of precision that may even be far, given the current state of the art, from what a trained human analyst could do. Therefore, it is also necessary to consider the need for the dataset being published to be reviewed and edited by specialized personnel before the actual publication. With this in mind, the techniques of data recognition mentioned above - regular expressions, Named Entity Recognition, etc. - could also be exploited to develop tools that can speed up the task of completing and verifying the accurate anonymization of the dataset.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

Unfortunately, the enormous amount of possible pathologies and medical conditions has led to the realization of extremely wide international codifications that are difficult to consult even for a human being. This difficulty makes the practice of annotation of diagnoses with ICD-10 codes very cumbersome and rarely performed. In order to support this operation, a classification model was proposed, able to analyze medical diagnoses written in natural language and automatically assign one or more international reference codes. The model has been evaluated on a dataset released in the Spanish language for the eHealth challenge (CodiEsp) of the international conference CLEF 2020, but it could be extended to any language with latin characters. We proposed a model based on a two-step classification process based on BERT and BiLSTM. Although still far from an accuracy sufficient to do without a licensed physician opinion, the results obtained show the feasibility of the task and are a starting point for future studies in this direction.","In many of the existing systems for storing patient clinical data, the medical report of the doctor is stored in the form of textual data. Only in a few cases, one or more identification codes are assigned to each of the diagnosed conditions. The process of assigning a unique code to pathologies, symptoms, clinical situations, and drugs is commonly referred to as Clinical Coding. Among the most widely used coding systems, we can find the tenth version of the international medical glossary published by WHO (World Health Organization), commonly known as ICD-10. It contains codes for diseases, signs, and symptoms, abnormal results, complaints, social situations, and external causes of injury or illness. The United States uses its national variant of the ICD-10 called the ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). A procedure classification called the ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) has also been developed for the acquisition of hospitalization procedures. There are over 70,000 ICD-10-PCS procedure codes and over 69,000 ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, compared to about 3,800 procedure codes and about 14,000 diagnosis codes in the previous ICD-9-CM. The use of an international classification to annotate medical diagnoses makes the health system interoperable between different countries. Among the many possibilities of using ICD codes, a doctor of any nationality could thus be able to read, analyze, and use the medical history of a patient even if of a different nationality. In addition, diagnostic patterns used by clinicians could be identified to improve automatic disease prediction strategies and provide automatic specialist support for decision making. These observations strongly support the need for automated systems to support clinicians to perform this task quickly and without human intervention. The contribution of our work is a novel model for ICD-10 coses annotation We proposed a model based on Bi-LSTM and BERT to assign one or more ICD-10 codes to the medical diagnosis. Specifically, we have designed our approach as a two-step process. In the first one, we use a BERT-based classifier to select from the dataset only a subset of sentences that could be candidates for the annotation step. In particular, those phrases are them that could e annotated with one or more codes. The phrases left were generally speaking expressions. In the second step, we used a Bi-LSTM model to analyze the candidate sentences and assign one or more codes to them. The results are encouraging and a good starting point for further investigations. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We start analyzing related works, and we go through the description of the model and the dates. Finally, we analyze the results obtained, and we expose our consideration of the task in the conclusion section.","The ability to automatically annotate medical reports with international codes is an open and relevant research challenge for future technologies of global medical data sharing. In this work, we have proposed a model based on the state of the art technologies to support the doctors during this time-consuming task. For example we can imagine the use of our model in a system that can suggest to the doctor a set of possible codes to choose from to note down the medical diagnosis. Such a suggestion could make this annotation process less complex for any human annotator. It is important to keep in mind that the ICD-10 code contains more than 70,000 codes and their number is constantly increasing. During the competition it was shown that the large number of possible labels was also the most difficult problem to deal with even for automatic systems. In this regard, in fact, many systems based on machine learning have found many more difficulties than hybrid systems able to select through linguistic rules a subset of possible assignable codes. This observation will be used by us in the future to improve the model proposed here. Currently, the results obtained are encouraging and confirm the possibility of tackling it with current technologies. Nevertheless, our system cannot obtain a score of reliability, such as acting independently, and the opinion of a human coder is still essential. The system proposed here has not won the challenge at CLEF 2020 but is still a good starting point for further studies that want to use those technologies to resolve the clinical coding task.",20,In-domain IR and IE

We automatically clean and annotate the corpus with PoS tags, lemmas, named entities and syntactic dependencies. Moreover, we compute frequency-based time series for tokens, lemmas and entities. We show some interesting corpus statistics taking into account the temporal dimension and describe some examples of usage of time series.","Diachronic linguistics is one of the two major temporal dimensions of language study proposed by de Saussure in his Cours de languistique générale and has a long tradition in Linguistics. Recently, the increasing availability of diachronic corpora as well as the development of new NLP techniques for representing word meanings has boosted the application of computational models to investigate historical language data (Hamilton et al., 2016; Tahmasebi et al., 2018; Tang, 2018). This culminated in SemEval-2020 Unsupervised Lexical Semantic Change Detection (Schlechtweg et al., 2020), the first attempt to systematically evaluate automatic methods for language change detection. Italian is a Romance language which has undergone lots of changes in its history. Its official adoption as a national language occurred only after the Unification of Italy (1861), having previously been a literary language. Diachronic corpora of Italian are currently available and accessible to the public (e.g., DiaCORIS and MIDIA). Unfortunately, restricted access/distribution of these resources limits their utilisation. This actually prevents the investigation of more recent NLP methods to the diachronic dimensions. To obviate this limit, we collect and make freely available a new corpus based on the newspaper “L’Unità”. Founded by Antonio Gramsci on February, 12th 1924, “L’Unità” was the official newspaper of the Italian Communist Party (PCI, henceforth). The newspaper had a troubled history: with the dissolution of PCI in 1991, the newspaper continued to live as the official newspaper of the new Democratic Party of the Left (PDS/DS) until July, 31th 2014. After that date, it ceased its publication until June, 30th 2015, and it was definitely closed on June, 3rd 2017. Since 2017, the historical archive of “L’Unità” has been made again visible and available on the Web. One of the main issues of this resource is the lack of information about who owns the rights of the original archive. To our knowledge, the online version of the archive was legally obtained by downloading the original archive before the closure of the newspaper. The current archive, available online, does not contain the local editions of the newspaper and the photographic archive. The main contribution of this work lies in the resource itself and its accessibility to the research community at large. The corpus is distributed in two formats: raw text and pre-processed. The validity of the corpus for the automatic study of language change is currently tested as part of the DIACR-Ita task at EVALITA 2020. However, we illustrate some further potential applications of the use of the corpus.","In this paper, we describe an Italian diachronic corpus based on the newspaper “L’Unità”. The corpus spans 67 years (1948-2014) and is provided both in plain text and in an annotated format that includes PoS-tags, lemmas, named entities, and syntactic dependencies. We compute some statistics and time series for each token, lemma and named entity. We think that the corpus and the precomputed data are a valuable source of information both for linguists and researchers interested in diachronic analysis of the Italian language, and for historians, political scientists, and journalists as a digital resource enriched with automatic text analysis technologies. However, the corpus has some issues that we plan to fix in the future, such as OCR errors and logical document structure recognition. We also plan to process the corpus by exploiting other Italian NLP pipelines in order to understand the differences between the output of different tools. Finally, we are working on generating and making available temporal word embeddings for each year.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We approach AA via Authorship Verification on short Italian texts in two novel datasets, and analyze the interaction between genre, topic, gender and length. Results show that AV is feasible even with little data, but more evidence helps. Gender and topic can be indicative clues, and if not controlled for, they might overtake more specific aspects of personal style.","Authorship Attribution (AA) is the task of identifying authors by their writing style. In addition to being a tool for studying individual language choices, AA is useful for many real-life applications, such as plagiarism detection AUTHOR, multiple accounts detection AUTHOR, and online security AUTHOR. Most work on AA focuses on English, on relatively long texts such as novels and articles AUTHOR where personal style could be mitigated due to editorial interventions. Furthermore, in many real-world applications the texts of disputed authorship tend to be short AUTHOR. The PAN 2020 shared task was originally meant to investigate multilingual AV in fanfiction, focusing on Italian, Spanish, Dutch and English AUTHOR. However, the datasets were eventually restricted to English only, to maximize the amount of available training data AUTHOR, emphasizing the difficulty in compiling large enough datasets for less-resourced languages. AA research in Italian has largely focused on the single case of Elena Ferrante AUTHOR }. The present work seeks a more realistic take, using more diverse, user-generated data namely web forums comments and diary fragments, thereby introducing two novel datasets for this task: ForumFree and Diaries. We cast the AA problem as authorship verification (AV). Rather than identifying the specific author of a text (the most common task in AA), AV aims at determining whether two texts were written by the same author or not AUTHOR. The GLAD system of AUTHOR was specifically developed to solve AV problems, and has been shown to be highly adaptable to new datasets AUTHOR. GLAD uses an SVM with a variety of features including character level ones, which have proved to be most effective for AA tasks AUTHOR, and is freely available. Moreover, AUTHOR show that many of the best models for authorship attribution are based on Support Vector Machines. Hence we adopt GLAD in the present study. More specifically, we run GLAD on our datasets and study the interaction of four different dimensions: topic, gender, amount of evidence per author, and genre. In practice, we design intra-topic, cross-topic, and cross-genre experiments, controlling for gender and amount of evidence per author. The focus on cross-topic and cross-genre AV is in line with the PAN 2015 shared task AUTHOR; this setting has been shown to be more challenging than the task definitions of previous editions AUTHOR. Contributions: We advance AA for Italian introducing two novel datasets, ForumFree and Diaries, which contribute to enhance the amount of available Italian data suitable for AA tasks. Running a battery of experiments on personal writings, we show that AV is feasible even with little data, but more evidence helps. Gender and topic can be indicative clues, and if not controlled for, they might overtake more specific aspects of personal style.","We experimented with AV on Italian forum comments and diary fragments. We compiled two datasets and performed experiments which considered the interaction among topic, gender, length and genre. Even when the texts are short and present more individual variation than traditional texts used in AA, AV is a feasible task, but having more evidence per author improves classification. While making the task more challenging, controlling for gender and topic ensures that the system prioritizes authorship over different data clusters. Although the datasets used are intended for AV problems, they can be easily adapted to other AA tasks. We believe this to be one of the major contributions of our work, as it can help to advance the up-to-now limited AA research in Italian.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

We provide a thorough analysis of GePpeTto’s quality by means of both an automatic and a humanbased evaluation. The automatic assessment consists in (i) calculating perplexity across different genres and (ii) a profiling analysis over GePpeTto’s writing characteristics. We find that GePpeTto’s production is a sort of bonsai version of human production, with shorter but yet complex sentences. Human evaluation is performed over a sentence completion task, where GePpeTto’s output is judged as natural more often than not, and much closer to the original human texts than to a simpler language model which we take as baseline.","Language Models (LMs) based on pre-trained architectures such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) have provided impressive improvements across several NLP tasks. While for BERT-based architectures several monolingual models other than English have been developed, language-specific implementations of generative pre-trained transformer based models, such as GPT2, are not widely available yet. As a contribution to fill this gap, we developed GePpeTto, the first generative language model for Italian, using the original GPT-2 as a blueprint. The evaluation of generated text is known to be intrinsically difficult (Gatt and Krahmer, 2018); we adopt here an encompassing approach, performing both automatic and human-based evaluations. The automatic assessment consists in two strategies: the first involves calculating perplexity across different language models trained on various datasets representing different genres. This serves to understand how good GePpeTto is as a language model, and how much it captures the various genres. The second one is a profiling analysis where, by means of a series of linguistic features, we capture some of GePpeTto’s writing characteristics, and compare them to those of the data it was trained on. Finally, the human evaluation is performed over a sentence completion task where GePpeTto is evaluated against gold standard sentences as well as a simple Markov-based baseline. We make the model available to the community.","GePpeTto is the first GPT-2-based language model for Italian. Through both automatic and manual evaluation we assessed its quality on a variety of texts and in comparison to gold data as well as another statistical generation model. Results show that GePpeTto is able to produce text which is much closer to human quality rather than to the text generated by the other generation model we have used. Linguistic analysis also highlights that GePpeTto’s production is quite similar to human production, though in a sort of bonsai version, since its sentences are on average shorter than the original texts, but with similar complexity. The availability of GePpeTto opens up substantial possibilities. In the same way that GPT-2 is changing the approach to several NLP English tasks, we can expect GePpeTto to serve a similar purpose in Italian language processing.",1,Language Models

Emotions can be identified in many sources, among which there are semantics and sentiment in texts AUTHOR. In NLP, Sentiment Analysis already boasts many state-of-the-art tools that can accurately predict or classify the polarity of a text. However, real applications often need to go beyond the dichotomy positive-negative and identify the emotional content of a text with a finer granularity. Nevertheless, the task of predicting a precise emotion from text brings many challenges, mostly because there is a need of context: emotions can't be easily understood in isolation, as they are conveyed by a complex of explicit (e.g. speech) and implicit (e.g. gesture and posture) behavioural cues. Still, there has been an increasing interest in research for text-based emotion detection AUTHOR. In this work, we study how textual information extracted from the screenplay of a movie can be used to predict the emotions perceived by a group of people during the view of the movie itself.

Instead, when predicting generic emotional elicitation, a larger amount of text is required for an accurate prediction. We also show that lexical, morpho-syntactic and syntactic aspects of the sentences cannot be used to infer emotional elicitation during the view of the movie.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Radicioni",A Resource for Detecting Misspellings and Denoising Medical Text Data,ENG,5,0,0,Università di Torino,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Turin,"In this paper we propose a method for collecting a dictionary to deal with noisy medical text documents. The quality of such Italian Emergency Room Reports is so poor that in most cases these can be hardly automatically elaborated; this also holds for other languages (e.g., English), with the notable difference that no Italian dictionary has been proposed to deal with this jargon. In this work we introduce and evaluate a resource designed to fill this gap.","Noise in textual data is a very common phenomenon afflicting text documents, especially when dealing with informal texts such as chats, SMS and e-mails. This kind of text inherently contains spelling errors, special characters, nonstandard word forms, grammar mistakes, and so on (Liu et al., 2012). In this work we focus on a type of text which can also be very noisy: emergency room reports. In the broader frame of a project aimed at detecting injuries stemming from violence acts in narrative texts contained in emergency room reports, we recently developed the VIDES, so dubbed after ‘Violence Detection System’ (Mensa et al., 2020). This system is concerned with categorizing textual descriptions as containing violence-related injuries (V) vs. nonviolence-related injuries (NV), which is a relevant task to the ends of devising alerting mechanisms to track and prevent violence episodes. VIDES combines a neural architecture which performs the categorization step (thus discriminating V and NV records) and a Framenet-based approach, whereby semantic roles are represented through a synthetic description employing a set of word embeddings.2 More specifically, a model of violent event has been devised: records that are recognized as containing violence-related injuries are further processed by an explanation module, which is charged to individuate the main elements corroborating that categorization (V) by identifying the involved agent, the type of injury, the involved body district etc.. Explaining the categorization ultimately involves filling the semantic components of the violence frame. All such elements contribute to recognizing a violent event as the source of the injuries complained by ER patients. During the development of VIDES we realized that in order to run sophisticated algorithms for the detection and extraction of such violent traits we needed to cope with the noise contained in the input medical records. Some efforts have been invested to deal with different sorts of linguistic phenomena menacing the comprehension of texts; however, most existing works are focused on the English language, and rely on dictionaries that cannot be directly employed on Italian text documents. In this preliminary work we start to tackle the issue of noisy words in medical records for Italian texts, by specifically focusing on misspellings. Our contribution is twofold: we first manually explore the dataset by analyzing a small sample of records in order to determine whether the main traits and issues present in other languages are also shared by Italian reports; secondly, we collect, merge and evaluate a set of Italian dictionaries, which constitute a brick fundamental to build any domain specific spell-checking algorithm (LópezHernández et al., 2019).","In this work we tackled the issue of detecting textual noise in Italian room emergency reports, focusing specifically on misspellings. Firstly we examined the reports and found out that the sorts of issues reported in literature for other languages can also be found in Italian text documents. Secondly, we developed and evaluated an Italian dictionary suited for the task of noise detection. In future work we plan to expand the dictionary by including the terms from the Italian ICD-9 and ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases), that may be useful to interpret acronyms and resolve abbreviations. Moreover, we plan to employ this dictionary in a fully fledged spell-checking system. Finally, the usage of semantic —sense indexed— representations such as, e.g., (Mensa et al., 2018) and (Colla et al., 2020a; Colla et al., 2020b) will be explored, in order to deal with real word mistakes, and more in general contextual information (Basile et al., 2019) will be considered as a main cue in order to uncover and correct this sort of errors. For example, by leveraging the terminology surrounding noisy tokens we plan to distinguish the more scattered misspellings from the other terms that are not present in our dictionary.",20,In-domain IR and IE

We present and evaluate an e-dictionary (NDS) and a grammar checker (GramDivvun) for North Sámi. We achieve a coverage of 98% for NDS-queries and of 96% for compound error detection in GramDivvun.","In this paper, we discuss the use and necessity of the lexicalization of compounds – in addition to the dynamic approach to compounding – in two rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, a grammar checker GramDivvun and an electronic dictionary NDS (short for Neahttadigisánit). We argue for a dual approach and support this view with an evaluation of these tools. For comparison, we also look at a third application, a corpus tool (Korp) for the North Sámi corpus SIKOR. SIKOR, the Sámi International KORpus, is the collection of texts in different Sámi languages compiled by UiT The Arctic University of Norway and the Norwegian Sámi Parliament. In the past, we have mostly focussed on the dynamic approach to morphological analysis. This means that we have a lexicon with lemmata and stems, which in a finite-state manner are combined with inflectional and derivational affixes and other stems and modified when morpho-phonological processes apply. In this way the linguistic processes inflection, derivation and compounding are modelled in a dynamic way, i.e. by means of concatenation and composition as opposed to listing of all forms. Lexicalization, i.e. listing compounds or inflected word forms as such, is the alternative approach to the dynamic one. In addition to these two approaches we also use guessers for certain tasks, i.e. proper name guessing in morphosyntactic parsing. Our approach is entirely rulebased and open source. Within our 20 year experience with language tools for the Sámi languages and other languages with complex morphology, we have achieved good results and produced reliable tools. There are a number of approaches to error detection of a few errortypes for morphologically complex - although less complex than North Sámi languages like Latvian (Deksne, 2019) and Russian (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2019). The Latvian neural network grammar checker focusses on preposition-postposition confusion, adjectivenoun agreement, mood errors in verb forms, number and case in noun forms, definiteness of adjectives and missing commata. All of these error types have a good performance with precisions between 78% and 98.5%. Judging from their regular expressions to insert artificial errors, most of their error types seem to be fairly local errors that can be resolved based on bigrams. The Russian system focusses on more advanced error types - case, number agreement, gender agreement, preposition and aspect. However, the results show that the system is still in its initial phase with low precision and recall for most error types (precision is between 22% and 56%, only gender agreement reaches 68%, and recall is significantly lower, between 9% and 36%). None of these approaches deals with compound error detection. For neural network approaches, large corpora with error mark-up are necessary, which are not available for North Sámi. The error marked-up corpus contains 120 459 words, and when looking at specific error types – as in this case compound errors – the corpus is even smaller. The Russian system is based on an error-marked corpus of 200k words (deemed too small by its authors), the Latvian system works with artificial errors, an approach that can be problematic as it does not reflect real text errors. In compounding, two or several words are combined to form a new word. In Sámi, Finnic and Germanic languages, compounding is a productive process and new compounds like in (1) can be made on the fly. In Romance languages, these compounds typically correspond to prepositional constructions (ital. ‘la federa del cuscino del divano’). The initial motivation for extensive lexicalization of compounds of North Sámi goes back to adapting the spellchecker to users’ needs, i.e. avoiding false alarms in Ávvir newspaper’s texts. North Sámi is a Uralic language spoken in Norway, Sweden and Finland by approximately 25 700 speakers (Simons and Fennig, 2018). It is a synthetic language, where the open parts of speech (PoS) – nouns, adjectives, etc. – inflect for case, person and number. The grammatical categories are expressed by a combination of suffixes and stem-internal processes affecting root vowels and consonants alike, making it perhaps the most fusional of all Uralic languages. In addition to compounding, inflection and derivation are common morphological processes in North Sámi. North Sámi has seven morpho-syntactic cases, i.e. nominative (Nom.), genitive (Gen.), accusative (Acc.), illative (Ill.), locative (Loc.), comitative (Com.), and essive (Ess.). Case plays a more central role in Sámi than in preposition-based case languages, since here syntactic functions are identified based on case only. In addition, nouns can bear possessive suffixes. Verbs are inflected for person, number (singular, dual, plural), tense (present and past tense) and mood (indicative, conditional, and potential). Derivational processes (passive, causative, inchoative, diminutive, reflexive, to name only some of them) enhance the combinatory possibilities of each verb. Table 1 illustrates that compounding in North Sámi is by no means restricted to noun noun combinations, but includes a number of other parts-ofspeech (PoS) as well, also as heads. In North Sámi, compounds are formed without a hyphen, except for those involving a proper noun, a digit, or an acronym like Davvi-Norgii ‘Northern Norway (Ill.)’, 3-juvllatsykkel ‘tricycle’, and ILO-álgoálbmotsoahpamuš ‘ILO-indigenous people agreement’ (Riektačállinrávvagat, 2015, p.46). There are a number of multiwords where a space is obligatory (albma ládje ‘properly’ and duollet dálle ‘sometimes’). Also genitive first compounds have an alternative interpretation when written apart, which makes error detection more difficult.","We have shown that the lexicalization of compounds – in addition to their dynamic treatment – is useful and necessary for two language applications for North Sámi, an e-dictionary (NDS) and a grammar checker (GramDivvun). The evaluation of NDS shows that we get a good coverage: 98% of the compounds logged do get a translation and 72% are lexicalized in the FST. The evaluation of GramDivvun has shown that we manage to identify compound errors with a precision of 98% and a recall of 49% utilising a combination of information from the lexicon and syntax. We conclude that there are perfectly good reasons for lexicalizing compounds, i.e. providing idiomatic translations for when it cannot be derived from the parts, and to support compound grammar checking. At the same time, lexicalization can dissimulate word formation information in corpus tools. This can be resolved and we have already implemented a solution in Constraint Grammar to make the information available in a future version of the corpus tool. As dynamic compounding is limited to few PoS at the moment, in the future we want to investigate and model compounding of other PoS (in the FST). Also experiments with neural network approaches and a comparison of the results to our rule-based grammar checker could be an interesting future project.",5,Latin Resources

This paper presents the data and the methodology adopted to create the glossary as well as the evaluation of the first results. {\let\thefootnote\relax}","Languages for Special Purposes (LSP) have their roots in the need of communicating specialised and technical knowledge within a restricted group of domain experts. From a linguistic perspective, LSP are mainly characterised by the use of specialised terminology, which is usually monosemous for the principle of clearly defining concepts and avoiding miscommunication and can often result opaque and unintelligible to laypeople AUTHOR. In fact, for these reasons, it is often necessary to modulate specialised languages when both oral and written communication takes place between expert and non-experts, in order to ease the didactic and informative functions of communication AUTHOR. The language used in the domain of Cultural Heritage (CH), and its sub-domains, such as Archaeology, shares many points with other LSPs, such as the presence of technical terminology, terms of Greek and Latin origins, re-semantisation of common words into specialised domains of knowledge, complex multiword expressions, to mention a few. Nonetheless, it has been traditionally less investigated if compared to, for example, the language of medicine or law, which are considered soft disciplines too. As a consequence, except for a few felicitous examples (see Section 2), language resources and especially terminological resources, in this domain, are still needed. Language resources such as glossaries, thesauri, dictionaries and term-banks are invaluable sources for language experts, translators, learners, among others. Their development can often be demanding and time-consuming, especially when carried out manually. Specialised domain resources are even more challenging because their creation also needs the validation of experts in the domain of knowledge. In this paper we present our work aimed at the creation of a multilingual glossary of archaeological terms, which is useful in many application scenarios from Machine Translation (MT) to Natural Language Processing (NLP). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related work and, following this, Section 3 presents the Archaeo-Term Project's aims and the creation of the multilingual glossary of archaeological terms, along with the description of the starting data used so far, namely the ICCD Thesaurus, and the methodology applied to extract multilingual data from the Getty AAT.

The Archaeo-Term glossary is an ongoing project which will address, as future steps, the completion of missing data (terms, definitions, correspondences, examples, etc.) for English, Dutch, Spanish and German, as well as the enlargement of the glossary on the basis of the semi-automatic extraction of terminology from specialised corpora and other existing glossaries for the languages currently foreseen.

It comprises about 55k usergenerated stories inspired to the original fantasy saga “Harry Potter” and published on a popular website. The corpus is large enough to support data-driven investigations in many directions, from more traditional studies on language variation aimed at characterizing this genre with respect to more traditional ones, to emerging topics in computational social science such as the identification of factors involved in the success of a story. The latter is the focus of the presented case-study, in which a wide set of multi-level linguistic features has been automatically extracted from a subset of the corpus and analysed in order to detect the ones which significantly discriminate successful from unsuccessful stories.","Computational Sociolinguistics is an emergent interdisciplinary field aimed at exploiting computational approaches to study the relationship between language and society AUTHOR. One of the primary factors driving its foundation is the widespread diffusion of social media and other user-generated data available online, which has promoted massive research on computer-mediated communication from several perspectives. For instance, scholars working in the field of genre and register variation have relied on quantitative approaches to inspect the peculiarities of social media language, with the purpose of providing a characterization of this new genre with respect to more traditional ones AUTHOR. In the NLP community, the writing style of user-generated data has been analyzed through computational stylometry approaches for addressing tasks broadly related to author profiling AUTHOR, such as gender and age detection AUTHOR. The vast majority of this work has taken into account contents published on few microblogging platforms considered as more representative of the contemporary user-generated mediascape, e.g. Twitter. More recently, the attention has been oriented to the language used by online communities whose members share a common interest towards an object, an activity -- and more in general any area of human interest -- allowing scholars to shed light on the growing phenomenon of fandom AUTHOR. One of the most prominent expressions of fandom is fanfiction (fanfic, fic or FF), i.e.\ fiction written by fans of a TV series, movie, book etc., using existing characters and situations to develop new plots. In many languages dedicated websites exist where users can publish their own literary works inspired to the original book they are fans of. From a computational linguistics standpoint, one perspective from which fanfiction has been investigated aimed to infer the relationship between user-generated stories and their original source, e.g.\ comparing the representation of characters according to their gender, as well as to model reader reactions to stories AUTHOR. Inspired to that study, which was based on a large dataset of stories mainly in English, we collect a new corpus of fanfic stories}, which, to our knowledge, is the first one for the Italian language. We rely on this corpus to carry out an investigation aimed at shedding light on the possibility of computationally modeling the expected success of a fanfic story, based on the assumptions of linguistic profiling and stylometry research.","In this paper, we presented a NLP-based stylometric analysis on the emerging genre of fanfiction aimed at characterizing the writing style of a successful story. We collected a new large-scale corpus which – to the best of our knowledge – is the first one of this genre for Italian. We showed that successful stories, defined as those receiving a number of reviews higher that the average, are characterized by a variety of linguistic features at different levels of granularity and that these features are more uniformly distributed within them. In the future, we would like to broad the perspective to other genres in order to study whether there are linguistic predictors of successful writing which are constant across different genres, as well as across concepts somehow similar to success, such as virality and engagement.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

ItaGLAM has been annotated with a set of labels which may be useful to identify different types of communication. Furthermore, the collected data have been used to train a set of classifiers. The results are analyzed to evaluate the information flow between GLAM and users and to analyze cultural communication on the Web.","Over the last years, Social Networks have become one of the most popular platforms for sharing experiences and opinions through the use of simple strings of text AUTHOR. Indeed, this way of communicating has become an essential interaction tool, not only among private users, but also among companies to engage with their audience and to promote their brands AUTHOR. The use of social networks has also been adopted by museums, that, over time, have changed their way of communicating with their audience}. In particular, in regards to the GLAM sector, a new trend has been observed in recent years: the use of the web as a way to create and foster an online community AUTHOR. While during the first decade of this century museum professionals considered the exhibition of collections on social networks AUTHOR as `excessive', nowadays the use of these platforms has become the norm. As AUTHOR pointed out in their study about the use of social networks (and in particular Instagram) by museums in the Greek culture scene: `social media has become a key factor in the way that cultural organizations communicate with their public in supporting the marketing of performing art organizations'. Such centrality makes the Social network a potentially effective means that allows GLAMs to reach a wide and heterogeneous audience and to adapt to it. Therefore, we believe that the analysis of the cultural communication implies an analysis of how cultural corporations interact with the audience through social networks. After considering the most used social networks (namely Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) in the cultural sector, we have decided to focus our research on the use of Twitter, which has already been proven to be a solid basis to analyze institutional communication, as AUTHOR have highlighted. Therefore, the main aim of our research is to investigate how Italian GLAMS have extraordinarily AUTHOR interacted with their audience during the lockdown in Italy due to the COVID-19 pandemic AUTHOR, i.e. in the period from the 8th of March to the 5th of May 2020 (as per DPCM March 11 2020). Over this time many cultural initiatives have been launched with the aim of strengthening the dialogue with the audience and make sure that, despite the impossibility of any kind of physical access, the connection between GLAMs and their visitors would not be interrupted. It has been observed that during the aforementioned period, while GLAMs institutions have drastically increased their use of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, the latter one was the only Social Network for which an increase in the interaction audience-institution has been registered AUTHOR. The study of communicative intents by GLAMs through Social Networks in the Italian language is still novel and, as such, best practices and tools to use still need to be tested and honed. In particular, there is still the need for an annotated corpus and a classifier that can be used on large amounts of data. Despite the time frame taken into account is relatively short (covering 58 days in total), we think that investigating how Italian GLAMs used the web when it was the only form of communication at their disposal, represents a good training ground to test our practices and to train and evaluate different kinds of classifiers useful also in future works. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the related works in the analysis of communication on Twitter by cultural institutions. Section 3 introduces the methodology used in this analysis: namely, it describes the creation of the corpus, the creation and use of the annotation set, and the training and evaluation of different classifiers. Finally, in Section 4 we explain the results of the research.","In this work, we have described our project for classifying communicative intents in tweets written by Italian GLAMs during the COVID-19 lockdown. Through the experiments and the following analysis we have shown how this task can be challenging. As future work we will focus on: increasing the size of the corpus, integrating statistical techniques to help dealing with imbalanced labels, and finally improving the selection and reweighting of the features (in particular concerning the hashtags). Another topic which needs further investigation concerns the use of different kinds of textual embeddings, which might improve the result. Once honed, the metholody and the tools we have used in this research could become an important asset in better understanding and analyzing cultural communication on the Web.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Project results include: (i) a freely available collection of multilingual clinical cases; and (ii) a two-level annotation scheme based on temporal relations (derived from THYME), whose purpose is to allow the construction of clinical timelines, and taxonomy relations based on medical taxonomies, to be used for semantic reasoning over clinical cases.","Identifying clinically relevant events and anchoring them to a chronology is very important in clinical information processing, as the ability to access an ordered sequence of events can help to understand the evolution of clinical conditions in patients. However, although interest in information extraction from clinical narratives has increased in recent decades, attention has been focused on clinical entity extraction and classification (Schulz et al., 2020; Grabar et al., 2019; Dreisbach et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2017) rather than on temporal information. If temporal information is extracted from clinical free text, it can be added to structured data collections, e.g. MIMIC III (Johnson et al., 2016), to train clinical prediction systems. Despite some effort on the organization of clinical narratives processing challenges, e.g. CLEF eHealth (Kelly et al., 2019), few shared training and test data sets have been created, and thus developing tools for this task is still difficult. In fact, the amount of freely available annotated corpora for any of the clinical information extraction tasks has not grown at the same rate as interest in the field, mainly due to patient privacy and data protection issues. In addition, most datasets consist of English texts, which makes research focus on that language. In an attempt to overcome these problems, we present the European Clinical Case Corpus (E3C), a project aimed at offering a freely available multilingual corpus of semantically annotated clinical narratives. The project will build a 5language (Italian, English, French, Spanish, and Basque) clinical narrative corpus to allow for the linguistic analysis, benchmarking, and training of information extraction systems. We build upon available resources and collect new data when necessary, with the goal to harmonize current annotations, introduce new annotation layers, and provide baselines for information extraction tasks. We foresee two types of annotations: (i) temporal information and factuality: events (including attributes expressing factuality-related information), time expressions, and temporal relations according to the THYME standard; and (ii) clinical entities: pathologies, symptoms, procedures, body parts, etc., according to standard clinical taxonomies (e.g. SNOMED-CT (Donnelly, 2006) and ICD-10 (WHO, 2015)). The E3C corpus is organized into three layers, with different purposes: Layer 1: about 25K tokens per language of clinical narratives with full manual or manually checked annotation of clinical entities, temporal information and factuality, for benchmarking and linguistic analysis. Layer 2: 50-100K tokens per language of clinical narratives with automatic annotation of clinical entities and manual check of a small sample (about 10%) of this annotation. Layer 3: about 1M tokens per language of non-annotated medical documents (not necessarily clinical narratives) to be exploited by semisupervised approaches. In this paper we present our data collection effort, focused on clinical cases (Section 3), and we describe our annotation scheme (Section 4).","We presented the E3C project, which aims to become a reference European corpus of annotated clinical cases. We focused on two initial achievements: (i) a freely available collection of clinical cases in five languages; and (ii) a comprehensive annotation scheme based both on temporal information and on medical taxonomies. Our next steps include the extensive manual annotation of the clinical cases in all five languages, and the definition of tasks and baselines on top of the annotated data, taking advantage of neural models derived from training data.

In particular, we investigate whether and how using different architectures of probing models affects the performance of Italian transformers in encoding a wide spectrum of linguistic features. Moreover, we explore how this implicit knowledge varies according to different textual genres.","In the last few years, the study of Neural Language Models (NLMs) and their representations has become a key research area in the NLP community. Several methods have been devised to obtain meaningful explanations regarding the linguistic information encoded in NLMs (Belinkov and Glass, 2019). The most common approach is based on the development of probes, i.e. supervised models trained to predict a variety of language properties using the contextual word/sentence embeddings of a pre-trained model (Conneau et al., 2018; Zhang and Bowman, 2018; Miaschi and Dell’Orletta, 2020). This approach demonstrated that NLMs representations encode linguistic knowledge in a hierarchical manner (Belinkov et al., 2017; Blevins et al., 2018; Tenney et al., 2019b), and can even support the extraction of dependency parse trees (Hewitt and Manning, 2019). Jawahar et al. (2019) investigated the representations learned by BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), one of the most prominent NLM, across its layers, showing that lower ones are usually better for capturing surface features, while embeddings from higher layers are better for syntactic and semantic properties. Using a suite of probing tasks, Tenney et al. (2019a) deeply explore this behavior showing that the linguistic knowledge encoded by BERT through its 12/24 layers follows the traditional NLP pipeline. While the vast majority of this research focused on English contextual representations, relatively little work has been done to understand the inner workings of non-English models. The study by de Vries et al. (2020) represents an exception in this context: authors apply the probing task approach to compare the linguistic competence encoded by a Dutch BERT-based model and multilingual BERT (mBERT), showing that earlier layers of mBERT are consistently more informative that earlier layers of the monolingual model. The survey by Nozza et al. (2020) also provides a comparative study of mBERT and language-specific BERT models but focused on the performance that each model obtains after training on several specific downstream tasks. In this paper, we adopt a task-agnostic perspective to carry out an in-depth investigation of the linguistic knowledge implicitly encoded by 6 Italian monolingual models and multilingual BERT. We define a broad set of probing tasks, each corresponding to a specific property of sentence structure. We then compare the average performance reached by each model in predicting the feature value, evaluating the results obtained by models using their layer-wise sentence-level representations. A further comparative perspective, which to our knowledge is still rather under-investigated, concerns the study of how the architecture of the probing model itself influences probing scores. To address this point, for each model, we perform the same suite of probing tasks using both a linear SVR and a multilayer perceptron (MLP), and compare whether and how each probing task’s resolution is affected by the two architectures. Since all experiments were carried out on different sections of Italian Universal Dependency Treebank (Nivre et al., 2016), we were also able to investigate how linguistic knowledge of NLMs varies according to different textual genres. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aimed at comparing the linguistic knowledge encoded in the representations of multiple non-English pre-trained transformer models. In particular: (i) we compare the probing performances of 6 Italian NLMs spanning three models over multiple linguistic feature categories; (ii) we investigate whether and how using different architectures of probing models affects the performance of transformers in encoding specific features; and (iii) we show how the implicit knowledge learned by these models differs across textual genres.","In this paper we presented an in-depth comparative investigation of the linguistic knowledge encoded in the Italian transformer models. Relying on a suite of more than 80 probing features and testing our approach with two different probing models, we showed that MLP is the best model for inferring the amount of information implicitly encoded in the NLMs representations. We also observed that BERT-base-italian achieved best scores in average, but the linguistic generalization abilities of the examined transformers vary according to specific groups of linguistic phenomena and across layers. Finally, we examined how the linguistic knowledge learned by the NLMs is affected by the distinct textual varieties available in Italian treebanks showing, for instance, that social media language represents a harder domain for all models. We are currently investigating if the linguistic knowledge encoded by a NLM positively affects the resolution of downstream tasks, as already suggested by the recent work by Miaschi et al. (2020) for English. This connection, which is still rather investigated, can improve our understanding of how such models make their decisions.",1,Language Models

Starting from the evidence that NLMs implicitly acquire sophisticated linguistic knowledge from a huge amount of training data, our goal is to investigate whether perplexity is affected by linguistic features used to automatically assess sentence readability and if there is a correlation between the two metrics. Our findings suggest that this correlation is actually quite weak and the two metrics are affected by different linguistic phenomena.","Standard Neural Language Models (NLMs) are trained to predict the next token given a context of previous tokens. The metric commonly used for assessing the performance of a language model is perplexity, which corresponds to the inverse geometric mean of the joint probability of words w_1,...,w_n in a held-out test corpus C. While being primarily an intrinsic metric of NLM quality, perplexity has been used in a variety of scenarios, such as to classify between formal and colloquial tweets AUTHOR, to detect the boundaries between varieties belonging to the same language family AUTHOR or to identify speech samples produced by subjects with cognitive and/or language diseases e.g. dementia AUTHOR or Specific Language Impairment AUTHOR. From the perspective of computational studies aimed at modeling human language processing, perplexity scores have also been shown to effectively match various human behavioural measures, such as gaze duration during reading AUTHOR. In this paper we focus on a less investigated perspective addressing the connection between perplexity and readability. Since by definition perplexity gives a good approximation of how well a model recognises an unseen piece of text as a plausible one, our intuition is that lower model perplexity should be assigned to easy-to-read sentences, while difficult-to-read ones should obtain higher perplexity. On the other hand, state-of-the-art NLMs trained on huge data have shown to implicitly learn a sophisticated knowledge of language phenomena, also with respect to complex syntactic properties of sentences AUTHOR. This could suggest that variations in terms of linguistic complexity, especially when related to subtle morpho--syntactic and syntactic features of sentence rather than lexical ones, could not impact on model perplexity to a great extent. This assumption seems to be confirmed by the (still unpublished) results by AUTHOR which, to our knowledge, is the only one explicitly leveraging unsupervised neural language model predictions in the context of readability assessment. According to this study, a NLM is even less perplexed by articles addressed at adults than by documents conceived for a younger readership. From a relatively different perspective focused on the ability of automatic comprehension systems to solve cloze tests, AUTHOR showed that NLMs performance is not suggesting that they are not affected by the level of text complexity. In order to test the validity of all these hypotheses, we rely on the perplexity score given by a state-of-the-art NLM for the Italian language to several datasets representative of different textual genres containing both easy-- and complex--to--read sentences: ideally, such datasets should emphasise the correlation between perplexity and readability (if present) since the corpora are explicitly designed to contain both simple and difficult examples. We inspect whether and to which extent it is possible to find a relationship between a readability score and the perplexity of a NLM. To this aim we investigate (i) if the perplexity of a NLM and the readability score of a set of sentences show a significant correlation and (ii) whether the two metrics are equally affected by the same set of linguistic phenomena that occur in the sentence.","The paper presented a study aimed at investigating the relationship between two metrics computed at sentence-level, i.e. perplexity of a state-of-the-art NLM for the Italian language and readability score automatically assigned to a sentence by a supervised classifier. We carried out our analysis considering several datasets differing at the level of textual genre and language variety. Specifically, we observed that comparing the rankings obtained using the two metrics we cannot find any significant correlation, either between the scores of the two metrics or with respect to the set of linguistic features that mostly impact their values. Further investigation within this line of research will explore whether we can draw the same observations when a different NLM is exploited to compute sentence perplexity.",1,Language Models

This is a relevant problem for the organization of the vast repertoire of Italian Opera arias available and to enable further analyses by both musicologists and the lay public. We shape the task as a multi-class supervised problem, considering six emotions: love, joy, admiration, anger, sadness, and fear. In order to address it, we manually-annotated an opera corpus with 2.5k verses ---which we release to the research community--- and experimented with different classification models and representations. Our best-performing models reach macro-averaged F_1 measures of \sim0.45, always considering character 3-grams representations. Such performance reflects the difficulty of the task at hand, partially caused by the size and nature of the corpus, which consists of relatively short verses written in 18th-century Italian.","Opera lyrics have the function of expressing the emotional state of the singing character. In 17th- and 18th-century operas, characters brought on stage passions induced in their souls by the succession of events in the drama. Musicological studies use these affects as one of the interpretative keys of the work as a whole (Zoppelli, 2001; McClary, 2012). Being able to automatically identify the emotions expressed by the different arias of each work would provide scholars with a useful tool for a systematic study of the repertoire. The technology to identify the emotion(s) expressed by an aria represents an effective tool to study the vast repertoire of arias and characters of this period for musicologists and the lay public alike. As an aria may express more than one emotion, we go one granularity level lower —at the verse level. The task is defined as follows: Identify the emotion expressed in a verse, in the context of an aria. In order to do that we created the AriEmozione 1.0 corpus: a collection of 678 operas with 2.5k verses, each of which has been manually annotated with respect to emotion. We experimented with different supervised models (e.g., SVMs, neural networks) and text (e.g., character n-grams and distributed representations). Our experiments show that, regardless of the model, character 3-grams outperform all other representations, reaching weighted macro-averaged F1 measures of ∼0.45. Underrepresented classes (e.g., fear) are the hardest to identify. Others, such as anger and sadness, being both negative, are often confused between each other. The rest of the contribution is distributed as follows. Section 2 describes the AriEmozione 1.0 corpus. Section 3 describe the explored models and representations. Section 4 discusses the experiments and obtained results. Section 5 overviews some related work. Section 6 closes with conclusions and proposals for future work.","We addressed the novel problem of emotion classification of opera arias at the verse level. The task is interesting because of the lack of automated tools for the analysis of operas and challenging due to both the language used in 17th- and 18th-century lyrics and the complexity to produce the necessary amount of quality supervised data. We explored with various classification models and representations. A neural network with two hidden layers fed with a simple TF-IDF character 3-gram representation is among the most promising approaches to the problem. Among the six possible emotions, the most difficult to identify are rabbia and tristezza, which tend to be confused with each other, followed by ammirazione, which is often confused by gioia. In order to foster the research on this topic, we release the AriEmozione 1.0 corpus to the community (cf. footnote 2). As for the future work, we intend to increase the size of the AriEmozione 1.0 corpus by means of active learning (Yang et al., 2009). Once a larger data volume is produced, we plan to explore with models to identify the emotion at the aria rather than at the verse level. Following the theory of emotion proposed by Plutchik (1980), we could identify the emotion of a whole aria by combining the emotions at the verse level, and then conduct experiments to verify which granularity is more adequate as a single emotion unit. In order to address the issue of emotional polysemy and ambiguity of aria verses, we aim at producing explainable models by highlighting the specific fragments expressing the emotion. Another interesting alternative is the one highlighted by Zhao and Ma (2019), who adopted an efficient meta-learning approach to augment the learning ability of emotion distribution; i.e. the intensity values of a set of emotions within a single sentence, when the training dataset is small, as in the AriEmozione 1.0 corpus.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Preliminary results show interesting differences rooted either in language-specific peculiarities or crosslingual annotation inconsistencies, with a potential impact on different application scenarios.","The identification of cross-lingual quantitative trends in the distribution of dependency relations in “gold” treebanks is increasingly attracting the interest of the computational linguistics community for different purposes, as testified e.g. by a recently published miscellaneous book on the quantitative analysis of dependency structures (Jiang and Liu, 2018) or pilot initiatives such as the first edition of the workshop “Quantitative Syntax 2019”2 . Among possible applications, it is worth mentioning studies aimed at acquiring typological evidence to be integrated in multilingual NLP algorithms (see Ponti et al. (2018) for a survey and the workshop “Typology for Polyglot NLP”3 ), or at detecting annotation inconsistencies to improve the quality of treebanks (see (Dickinson, 2015; de Marneffe et al., 2017) to mention only a few). While the latter is a well-established research topic, although with still many open issues, automatically acquiring typological information is still at its beginning, so automatic strategies to extract such information from corpora are needed (Cotterell and Eisner, 2017; Bjerva and Augenstein, 2018). Multilingual resources such as the dependency treebanks developed within the Universal Dependencies (UD) project4 , thanks to the cross-linguistically consistent syntactic annotation (Nivre, 2015), fostered the development of automatic strategies to extract cross-lingual similarities and differences in shared constructions from corpora (Murawaki, 2017; Bjerva et al., 2019). Within this line of research, the paper describes a methodology for comparing treebanks of typologically different languages with the final aim of detecting and quantifying similarities and differences in multilingual treebanks analyzed from a twofold perspective: language–specific peculiarities vs cross–lingual annotation inconsistencies. To this end, we used LISCA (LInguiStically– driven Selection of Correct Arcs) (Dell’Orletta et al., 2013), an algorithm which has been successfully applied in different scenarios, against both the output of dependency parsers and gold treebanks. In the first case, the score returned by LISCA was meant to identify unreliable automatically produced dependency relations (Dell’Orletta et al., 2013). When used against gold annotations, LISCA was used to detect shades of syntactic markedness of syntactic constructions in manually annotated corpora from a monolingual perspective (Tusa et al., 2016), or to acquire quantitative typological evidence from a multilingual perspective (Alzetta et al., 2018b). Last but not least, it was also exploited to identify anomalous annotations (going from annotation inconsistencies to errors) from a monolingual perspective in gold treebanks (Alzetta et al., 2018a). The methodology exploited for the present work (described in Section 2) was tested in a case study carried out on four Indo-European languages belonging to three different genera (according to WALS classification, Dryer and Haspelmath (2013)): Bulgarian (Slavic, BUL), English (Germanic, ENG), Italian and Spanish (Romance, ITA and SPA). UD treebanks constitute an ideal test bed for our analysis since, sharing the same annotation scheme, allow the investigation of crosslingual similarities and differences in shared constructions. Besides similarities connected with the UD annotation strategy aimed at maximising parallelism across languages, results in Section 4 reflect shared possibly “universal” features of languages. Differences, in turn, can either reflect typologically relevant language peculiarities or highlight inconsistencies in the application of the shared annotation scheme. The paper focuses on both aspects. Section 5 concludes the paper discussing our findings and future directions of research. The present contribution has two main goals: we aim to show how the methodology can be used 1) to acquire quantitative evidence of cross-linguistically shared properties, and 2) to highlight divergences due either to language idiosyncrasies or annotation inconsistencies across treebanks.","In this paper we presented method for studying the distribution of DRs in gold treebanks which was tested in a case study carried out on four languages belonging to three different genera. The crosslingual comparison of the LISCA-based ranking of UD relations across the bins shows: on the one hand, shared (possibly universal) trends, concerning e.g. the similar distribution of dependencies involving leaves or of long distance dependencies, which are respectively concentrated at the top and at the bottom of the LISCA ranking for each language; on the other hand, recorded differences in the ranking of relations can be explained in terms of either language peculiarities (e.g. the pro-drop property of BUL-ITA-SPA vs ENG, or the surface realisation of definite determiners in BUL vs ENG-ITA-SPA) or potential inconsistencies in the application of the UD annotation scheme (see the case of the indirect object relation). Both types of results play a potentially key role in different scenarios, going from typology-driven multilingual NLP to the improvement of the cross-lingual consistency of treebanks.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

We validated this correlation by showing a quantitative analysis of patterns of “finger-tracking” of Italian early graders engaged in reading a text displayed on a tablet. A web application interfaced with the tablet monitors the reading behaviour by modelling the way the child points to the text while reading. The analysis found significant developmental trends in reading strategies, marking an interesting contrast between typically developing and atypically developing readers.","Recent experimental evidence in visual perception analysis (Lio et al., 2019) shows that eye movements and finger movements strongly correlate during scene exploration, at both individual and group levels. In Lio et al.’s (2019) experiment, subjects are invited to explore a blurred image displayed on a touchscreen by moving their fingers on the display. Picture areas that are located immediately above the touch point of the subject’s finger on the screen are automatically shown in high resolution, thereby simulating the subject’s central (foveal) vision. The experiment proves that the subjects’ image-exploring patterns in the two modalities (optical and tactile) are highly congruent. The result is not surprising. A familiar context which exploits this synergistic behaviour is when children are learning to read. Despite the undoubtedly different dynamics of the two types of text exploration, finger-pointing to text helps children learn to look at print, and supports critical early reading behaviours: directional movement, attention focus, and voice-print match (Mesmer and Lake, 2010; Uhry, 2002). ReadLet (Ferro et al., 2018a; Ferro et al., 2018b) is a web application with a tablet front-end, designed to support online monitoring of silent and oral reading abilities through finger-tracking. Finger-tracking consists of recording the time series of touch events on the tablet screen where a child is reading a short story, while the child is pointing to the text with the index finger of her dominant hand.2 Preliminary analyses of our finger-tracking data (Pirrelli et al., 2020) highlighted a diminishing influence of word frequency and word length on reading time as readers get older and more proficient (from 3rd to 6th grades). With increasing exposure to written words, differences in tracking time between high and low frequency words gradually tend to decrease, suggesting a ceiling effect in the entrenchment of both high- and low-frequency lexical representations in long-term memory (Zoccolotti et al., 2009). Similarly, word length was found to significantly interact across grades. Younger readers show increasing difficulty with longer words, with a steeper time increment for word length > 6, while older readers are slowed down when words are longer than 8 letters. This integrates previous evidence (De Luca et al., 2008), confirming that not even the most experienced readers can avoid the slowing down effect of word length. The two-fold interaction of word frequency and word length with grade levels strongly suggests that Italian children use a lexical route to decoding even at early stages of their reading development, despite the transparency of Italian orthography (Bates et al., 2001; Davies et al., 2013). It also suggests that young readers can make use of sublexical information, whenever they are confronted with words that are not contained in their orthographic lexicon. This developmental dynamic would account for the stronger sensitivity of less skilled readers to both lexical frequency and word length. As lexical information increases with age, with rarer and longer words finding their way into the reader’s orthographic lexicon, the reader makes an increasingly prominent use of lexical information and an increasingly sparser use of sublexical information. In this paper, we provide a finer-grained quantitative analysis of the finger-tracking profile of typically developing readers, offering further evidence that their reading strategy results from an optimal, interactive combination of both lexical and sublexical information. The evidence is compared with the finger-tracking profile of difficult readers. To provide a more realistic developmental profile of these effects, we restrict our focus on nouns only, which are less likely to be skipped while finger-tracking, and present a narrower range of variability in both length and frequency.","We provided evidence that finger-tracking data of reading children can highlight congruent developmental patterns in the acquisition of literacy skills. We only replicated established benchmark effects reported in the psycholinguistic literature on decoding transparent orthographies. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, this is the first time that fingertracking patterns are shown to significantly correlate with more established reading data. Unsurprisingly, typically developing readers were shown to read at a faster rate than atypical readers. Our comparative analysis shows that both groups of readers are sensitive to the same lexical effects, but that atypical readers rely on an impoverished lexicon. We take this evidence to show that although the two groups adopt the same strategy, they differ in their global ability in serial information processing, which has a boosting influence on lexical development and reading speed. Despite our promising results, one could legitimately wonder why we propose using fingertracking as a proxy of a more established technology such as eye-tracking. Portability and task ecology are our strongest arguments. ReadLet can be used in almost any environment with no data-acquisition specialist or invasive, anxietyprovoking equipment. This has practical consequences for research in education, computer science, human cognition and medical sciences. Our architecture supports highly parallel and distributed processes of data acquisition, which can be delivered in real time to research, clinical and education centers as terminals for data harvesting and quantitative analysis. Large-scale studies can be conducted, paving the way to more generalizable results than ever in the past. In addition, the possibility to take single-subject measurements on more occasions and in different environments makes finger-tracking evidence usable not only in group studies but also for individual diagnostic purposes. Furthermore, the fine-grained, multimodal evidence of different signal streams which are aligned with time and with linguistically annotated texts provides invaluable training data for artificial neural networks and classification algorithms designed to solve engineering problems or simulate neurophysiological correlates of cognitive tasks. Last but not least, we know that reading probes are a commonly used for monitoring progress in reading fluency and text comprehension (Miura Wayman et al., 2007), but take huge time and effort to collect. The use of a tablet for extended reading enables deriving this information unobtrusively and continuously, wherever the child fancies reading, even at home.",13,Multimodal

The research team collected 7,482 posts, the entire amount published in three specific dates: May 4, May 18 and June 3, corresponding with three different steps of the reopening phase of the country, led by the government. Instagram posts are composed by several kind of languages: captions (texts), hashtags, emojis and images. The aim of this work is to design a set of procedures revealing the different polarity trends for each one and to propose a unique measure. This measure can show the sentiment expressed by the texts, in their semiotic broad meaning. The methodology proposed is based on a fully automatic natural language processing pipeline, including the images’ analysis phase. Its output is an interactive dashboard (Figure 1) that is able to explore the sentiment analysis values about every single kind of text, and the synthesis of all of them. Thanks to a system of interactions and filters, the observation is leaded by the images’ features, such as different kind of spaces (indoor or outdoor) and different kind of the photos’ subject (human or not human). The collected geographical data enabled the analysis of several dimensions, with an overview observation based on the regional scale. Hence, it gave us an opportunity to focus on the deeper level of the Italian provinces. This choice is motivated by the Italian DPCM (Decreto Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri) published on 24 March 20201, in which it is stated the partial autonomy of the regions.","Throughout the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the different expressive forms used on Instagram, this work proposes a general view of COVID-19 in Italy.

The map can be visualized trough a dashboard letting users observe general and local reactions, down to the single province. The emotional effects of sense have been evaluated thanks to a polar and unique measure. In the end, did everything really go well for Instagram's Italy? In general, it seems so.

The aim is to build a model able to detect which class a tweet belongs to.","In the current era, social media represent the most common means of communication, especially thanks to the speed with which a post can go viral and reach in no time every corner of the globe. The speed with which information is produced creates an abundance of (linguistic) data, which can be monitored and handled with the use of hashtags (#).

In light of the above, our aim is to monitor social media in order to detect environmental crimes. Our research is guided by the following question: can Natural Language Processing (NLP) represent a valuable ally to identify these kinds of crimes through the monitoring of social media? For this purpose, we compiled a corpus of tweets starting from a list of 41 terms related to environmental crimes, e.g. combustione illecita (illicit combustion), rifiuti radioattivi (radioactive waste), discarica abusiva (illegal dumping), and we used the Twitter API to download all the tweets (specifically 228,412) related to these terms introduced by hashtag. In this research, a special focus is dedicated to the tweets related to La terra dei fuochi (literally the Land of Fires) AUTHOR, a large area located between Naples and Caserta (in the South of Italy) victim of illegal toxic wastes dumped by organized crime for about fifty years and routinely burned to make space for new toxic wastes.

We use as basic unit the notion of triple (head, relation, tail). We investigate if additional information about creativity improves natural language processing tasks. In this work, we focus on triple plausibility task, exploiting BERT model and a WordNet11 dataset sample. Contrary to our hypothesis, we do not detect increase in the performance.","Current conversational agents have emerged as powerful instruments for assisting humans. Oftentimes, their cores are represented by natural language processing (NLP) models and algorithms. However, these models are far from being exhaustive representation of reality and language dynamics, trained on biased data through deep learning algorithms, where the flow among various layers without could result in information loss (Wang et al., 2015). As a consequence, NLP techniques still find it challenging to manage conversation that they have never encountered before, reacting not efficiently to novel scenarios. One way to mitigate these issues is the integration of structured information, which knowledge graphs are one of the best-known systems for representing them. The most prominent example is the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee et al., 2001), where the information is represented through linked statements, each one composed of head,relation,tail, forming a triple (Figure 1). This semantic embedding allows significant advantages such as reasoning over data and operating with heterogeneous data sources. Integration of structured information is not the only method that literature provides us to improve NLP techniques. Previous researches pointed out that analysis of creativity features could improve self-assessment evaluation, with benefits for solutions generated and inputs understanding (Lamb et al., 2018; Karampiperis et al., 2014; Surdeanu et al., 2008). We specify that in this work creativity is intended as capability to create, understand and evaluate novel contents. The concepts of Creativity AI have been discussed in their interconnections with the Semantic Web (Ławrynowicz, 2020), generalizable to knowledge graphs. Kuznetsova et al. (Kuznetsova et al., 2013) define quantitative measures of creativity in lexical compositions, exploring different theories, such as divergent thinking, compositional structure and creative semantic subspace. The crucial point is that no every novel combinations are perceived creative and useful, distinguishing creativity perceived in unconventional, uncommon or ”expressive in an interesting, imaginative, or inspirational way”. Despite it is made clear the interest of the scientific community in exploring this direction, little research is conducted over creativity in the NLP field. The results and the considerations made by Kuznetsova and Ławrynowicz, led us to investigate the possible correlations between improvements in NLP tasks and creativity, with a particular focus on self-assessment. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for supporting deep learning algorithms with a mathematical representation of creativity feature of a text. We named it creativity embedding and based it on metrics of self-evaluation creativity over graph knowledge base.","In this paper we investigate if defined creativity embedding improves triple plausibility task, exploiting BERT model. We do not detect an increase in the performance (Table 1), comparing ourselves to KG-BERT results. In this comparison we should point out that the sample used is one fifth of the complete WN11 dataset. This result is somewhat contrary to our expectations, as the creativity embeddings represent in some way a priori information. A possible explanation might be the learning methodology of the creativity embedding: we suppose that a significant loss of information in the process has occurred. Further research might explore other types of embeddings (Grohe, 2020), as graph2vec, and different integration of the proposed metrics. Future experimental investigations may try different parameter configurations. For example, the number of nodes considered intuitively could change the values of metrics as a novelty. Nevertheless, more in-depth data analysis on the used dataset, corresponding knowledge graph, and data correlations could provide additional insights. In future work, we will consider different combinations of metrics defined to train the creativity neural network. It is possible that there are metrics more or not relevant for the task. Selecting metrics strictly relevant will result in a lightening of the computational effort and will give us information about correlations between metrics and results. To conclude, we aim to bring the NLP community’s attention to new research topics on creativity.",1,Language Models

The content, structure and potential of the database are described here, together with the main directions of current and future developments.","In the PISA 2000 report (OECD, 2003), a distinction is introduced between the concept of “reading literacy” as opposed to “reading”, the latter being restricted to the ability of decoding or reading aloud, the former including a much wider and more complex range of cognitive and meta-cognitive competencies: decoding, vocabulary, grammar, mastery of larger linguistic and textual structures and features, knowledge about the world, but also use of appropriate strategies necessary to process a text (p. 23). In the PISA 2019 report (OECD, 2019) ”reading literacy” is defined as ”an individual’s capacity to understand, use, evaluate, reflect on and engage with texts in order to achieve one’s goals, develop one’s knowledge and potential, and participate in society”, and as the ”range of cognitive and linguistic competencies, from basic decoding to knowledge of words, grammar and the larger linguistic and textual structures needed for comprehension, as well as integration of meaning with one’s knowledge about the world” (p.28). Achieving reading literacy is crucial for an individuals’ participation in society and ultimately for their realization in academic context, in workplace or, more generally, in life. To achieve reading literacy, pupils need first and foremost to be able to read accurately, understand what they read, and do this in a reasonably small amount of time. This multifaceted ability is defined here as “reading efficiency”. Efficient reading implies on its turn, in the subject, the development of deep comprehension skills. As a matter of fact, comprehension is a complex construct that requires coordination and processing of several cognitive abilities at word, sentence, and text level (Perfetti et al., 2005; Padovani, 2006), including, but not limited to, building coherent semantic representations of what is being read (Nation and Snowling, 2000), making lexical and semantic inferences, using reading strategies, activating metacognitive control (Carretti et al., 2002). When it comes to assessment, the above described complexity is not given due consideration and is, among other aspects, at the basis of the inadequacy of most protocols currently available. The latter often measure comprehension performance (in a way the ”product” of reading comprehension) without considering the underlying processes, or treat those processes as if they were independent, not in interaction with one another. In addition, reading comprehension tests often tend to be used interchangeably, while they actually measure different skills or processes and are not really comparable to one another (Colenbrander et al., 2017; Keenan et al., 2008; Cutting and Scarborough, 2006; Calet et al., 2020; Joshi, 2019). Finally, most currently available reading assessment tools fail to focus on reading efficiency, as they normally measure decoding and reading comprehension separately. This leads to failure in the identification of kids having difficulties in integrating the above mentioned abilities. The AEREST protocol for reading assessment was designed and developed to fill this gap, by testing student skills in three tasks: reading aloud, silent reading, and listening comprehension. In the last two conditions, the student’s comprehension of the text being read is assessed through a questionnaire. Only in the reading aloud condition, the text can also contain non-words. In 2019, AEREST was tested in schools located in Southern Tuscany (Italy) and in the Canton of Ticino (Switzerland), involving a total of 433 children, from the 3rd grade of the Italian primary school through to the first grade of the Italian middle school (6th grade). The protocol was automatically administered using a prototype version of ReadLet (Ferro et al., 2018a; Ferro et al., 2018b), a web-based platform that records large streams of time-aligned, multimodal reading data.","The AEREST protocol was shown to be effective in characterizing the decoding and comprehension performance of children of late primary school and early middle school in text reading tasks. Results are clear and encouraging, opening the way to further, more detailed, dynamic, and multimodal analysis. Completion of the current AEREST protocol with a second battery of tests is foreseen in the near future. This will provide schools with two different test batteries, to be used for assessment at the beginning and end of school year, for adequate monitoring of pupils’ reading and reading comprehension skills. A version of the protocol conceived for clinical context is also foreseen, as well as translation and adaptation of the protocol to languages other than Italian. The collected data will be assembled in a multimodal linguistic resource and made freely available to the scientific community.",11,Text Simplification

This research presents a corpus of over thirty thousand texts from Italian university Spotted. Focusing on the Covid phases (and on the immediately preceding period), we intend to illustrate how the corpus Spotted-Ita appears to be functional to a survey related to linguistic communication on the occasion of a unique and extraordinary experience experienced by university students.","Among the manifestations of the youth language, a particular role is acquitted by the writings of university students, who, despite the differences between the training courses (conventionally distinct in humanistic and scientific), attest to writing skills concerning the most educated layer of the young generations, the most educated on the standard uses of the language, and also exposed to the informal communication conditions of the web. On this basis, there are numerous academic analyses and researches aimed at defining the balance, the differences, the interferences, that are triggered between the various expressions of the written language within the diasystem of writings, from the places of the strictest formality (such as the thesis of degree) to those of maximum spontaneity (communications through social networks and instant messaging platforms). The natural permeability and l'osmotic relationship between the formal and informal levels, or public and private, reveals, in the student's writing, the typical opening to neological and non-standard forms (for graphics, grammar and lexic), induced by the so-called Internet language ('short' digital writings), and highlights the attached emotional connotation that of such adoptions constitutes the direct implication of expressive\footnote{In addition to the wide bibliography on the theme of the language and of the youth languages, of which only a few titles will be mentioned in the bibliography of this contribution, it is interesting here to mention, as a reference point for the general theme, the National Research Project 2017, ""UniverS-Ita.""

Most of the previous researches on speech disorders of people with dementia have been based on qualitative analysis, or on the study of a few dozen cases executed in laboratory conditions, and not in spontaneous speech (in particular for the Italian language). The creation of the Corpus Anchise 320 aims to investigate Dementia language by providing a broader number of dialogues collected in ecological conditions. Automatic linguistic analysis can help healthcare professionals to understand some characteristics of the language used by patients and to implement effective dialogue strategies.","In this paper we will present the construction of the first annotated corpus of conversations between healthcare workers and people with dementia for Italian, called “Corpus Anchise 320”, and the quantitative linguistic analysis we carried out. The aim of the project is twofold. On the one hand, we created a dataset of spoken dialogue transcriptions that is useful for research on the language of people with dementia. On the other hand, techniques typical of computational linguistics are applied to help doctors in assessing the state of the disease and implement effective dialogue strategies. Focusing attention on verbal exchanges between speakers is one of the cornerstones of the approach developed by the Anchise Group to support people with dementia and their caregivers, i.e. the “Enabling Approach” (Vigorelli 2018). The paper is divided in 4 sections. Section 1 introduces the topic of Alzheimer’s language Section 2 presents the recent researches and related works. In Section 3, the creation of the Corpus Anchise 320 will be discussed, which collects the transcripts and annotations of a set of dialogues between healthcare professionals and dementia patients carried out by the Anchise Group from 2007 until today, in Italian language. Section 4 will report the results of the computational linguistic analysis with the StanfordNLP library for Italian. The results obtained will be discussed to outline some of the peculiarities of the Dementia language. Section 5 concludes this paper with some final considerations.","In this paper we presented the first Italian corpus of conversations between healthcare professionals and people with dementia, called “Corpus Anchise 320”. The study of this corpus with computational linguistic analysis confirmed some characteristics of the language of people with dementia, such as the reduction in the rate of names and the increase in deictics. Corpus Anchise 320 has been built and archived according to GDPR. It is not publicly available but it can be requested to the authors for research purposes. The large number of the sample (320 conversations) and the use of computational analysis will make it possible to identify indicators of pathological language to be used in the preclinical phase, to trace the change in the linguistic abilities of people with dementia as the disease progresses, to put in relation the characteristics of the pathological language with a series of metalinguistic data such as age, sex and degree of dementia. The corpus will be increased in the coming months with the addition and annotation of other transcripts of dialogues of people with dementia.",13,Multimodal

The evaluation was carried out at sentence level, on a sample of 108 phrases from environmental, energy, biomedicine and drug disciplines texts, and the translations produced were evaluated by trained translators with disciplinary skills. DeepL's translation obtained a statistically equal assessment of human translation in terms of adequacy and slightly lower in terms of smoothness. The automatic translation of texts has also received a higher score than that obtained, in similar ways, by the automatic translation of journalistic texts.","The evaluation of the actual performance of machine translation systems continues to be a complex problem both from a theoretical and from a practical point of view. From a practical point of view, it is now evident that the most widely used measurement metrics after the 2000's, and in particular BLEU, are not actually able to adequately describe the differences and performance improvements of the systems currently in use, and in particular those based on neural networks (Bentivogli and others 2018a; Shterionov and others 2018; Tavosanis 2019). More recent proposals, such as BERTScore, have yet to be thoroughly evaluated and seem to provide very similar results to BLEU (Zhang and other 2020). It was therefore considered methodologically appropriate not to use them for this assessment, even as a comparison term. The only satisfactory type of assessment, to date, remains that carried out by human evaluators. Not all types of human assessment are equally satisfactory and reliable. The assessments carried out through crowdsourcing by individuals whose skills are not known assign for example to machine translation, systematically, higher scores than those awarded by persons with proven competence in the evaluation of translations (Castilho and others 2017a; Läubli and others 2020: 658). In this context there is no shortage of statements claiming the achievement of the ""parity"" between machine translation and human translation for some commercial systems (Hassan and others 2018). The independent verifications in some cases confirmed these results, but in others they showed significant differences (Toral and other 2018). This uncertainty is also largely due to the circumstances of the assessment, which can be very different from each other. This contribution aims to provide further results by entering into the research path described in Tavosanis (2019), against which it reinforces the method of investigation and varies the textual typology of reference. In Tavosanis (2019) the evaluations were carried out on journalistic texts; in this contribution specialized texts were chosen. The evaluation aims primarily to assess the quality of specialist translations in themselves and secondly to see whether the scores assigned to specialist translations are higher or lower than those assigned to translations of journalistic texts. In fact, automatic translation is normally used on texts belonging to very different genres, and evaluating a single genre is certainly very limiting. (Burchardt and others 2017: 159-160). In particular, given the significant linguistic differences between specialist texts and non-specialist texts, it seems likely that the same translation technology can produce very different results in both cases. Ensuring the quality of translations of texts from different domains has therefore been considered a problem since the first diffusion of systems based on neural networks. Koehn and Knowles (2017: 29), for example, noting that ""in different domains, words have different translations and meaning is expressed in different styles"" present the domain mismatch as the first ""challenge"" for these systems: in their assessments, in these contexts the NMT achieved results lower than those of the SMT systems. It also seems widespread that a generalist neural network translation system produces low quality results when applied to specialist texts (Chu and Wang 2020: 413). The domain adaptation is therefore an important development sector for the NMT (Chu and Wang 2018). However, assessments carried out with human evaluators are rare and almost absent for Italian.","The results obtained with this test support the hypothesis that even for Italian, at least for some textual types and at sentence level, automatic translation has reached a quality level statistically equal to that of human translation with regard to adequacy and slightly lower with regard to smoothness. They are therefore consistent with several other recent results, presented for other languages (Läubli and other 2020: 660), but it should be remembered that Italian was not included in the important tasks of WMT 2019 (Barrault and others 2019). In addition, the results obtained do not support the assumption that the NMT of general use systems achieves lower results when applied to specialist texts than when applied to non-specialized texts. The analysis naturally has several limits: for example, the assessed sample is relatively small, the fluctuations in the evaluators' judgement cannot be compared with an experienced professional average and the specialist domains taken into account are only two. However, the extension and improvement of these practices seem to be the only way to properly assess the capabilities of machine translation in Italian. As far as future developments are concerned, the need for a realistic assessment seems to make the transition from the evaluation of individual sentences to that of whole texts indispensable. The quality of machine translation at text level is, in many cases, significantly worse than that at sentence level (Läubli and others 2020: 660). The lack of structural systems to ensure text consistency in translation to neural networks suggests that the phenomenon is structural; however, dedicated assessments are needed to verify these hypotheses. At the same time, the comparison with the evaluation of journalistic texts suggests the idea that the results can vary significantly from one textual genre to another, and that at least in some cases they can be better than those obtained with non-specialist texts. Gender-related variability is not included in the very detailed summary of Läubli and others (2020), but it seems essential to take it structurally into account in order to make all future evaluations more robust.",10,Machine Translation

For this reason we decided to build JILDA, a novel data collection of chat-based dialogues, produced by Italian native speakers and related to the job-offer domain. JILDA is the first dialogue collection related to this domain for the Italian language. Because of its collection modalities, we believe that JILDA can be a useful resource not only for the Italian research community, but also for the international one.","Chatbots and spoken dialogue systems are now widespread; however, there is still a main issue connected to their development: the availability of training data. Finding useful data to train a system to interact as human-like as possible is not a trivial task. This problem is even more critical for the Italian language, where only few datasets are available. To supplement this deficiency of data, we decided to develop JILDA (Job Interview Labelled Dialogues Assembly), a new collections of chat-based mixed-initiative, human-human dialogues related to the job offer domain. Our work offers different elements of novelty. First of all, it constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first dialogue collection for this domain for the Italian language. Moreover, our dataset was not built using a Wizard of Oz approach, usually adopted in the realization of dialogues. Instead, we used an approach similar to the Map Task one, as we will describe in the next section. This allowed us to obtain more complex, mixed-initiative dialogues.","In this paper we presented JILDA, a novel dataset of chat-based, mixed-initiative dialogues built for the Italian language and related to the job-offer domain.

The JILDA dataset, which includes 525 dialogues, is in the process of being completely annotated with dialogue acts and entities related to this specific domain. For the annotation of those dialogues we are using our own extension of LIDA. The annotated dialogues will then be used to train a conversational agent.

We then use this resource to perform an entropy-based analysis of the mutual predictability of wordforms within Italian verb paradigms, and compare our findings to the ones of previous work on stem predictability in Italian verb inflection.","The pioneering work of AUTHOR has inspired an influential line of research where predictability within inflectional paradigms is modelled by resorting to the notion of morphomic stems – i.e., stems that cannot be considered as bearing any meaning, as they appear in groups of cells that do not share a fixed morphosyntactic content. In this perspective, every lexeme is seen as equipped with a set of indexed stems, that only for regular lexemes are mutually predictable, while for irregular verbs they need to be independently stored. From each of these stems, a fixed set of wordforms can be obtained by adding the appropriate inflectional endings. An analysis relying on these assumptions was proposed by AUTHOR and subsequent work -- see AUTHOR for a recent survey -- to account for the patterns of stem allomorphy that are found in the verbal inflection of Romance languages in general. More detailed implementations of these ideas have then been provided for individual languages, among them Italian AUTHOR. Another possibility that has been explored in more recent times is tackling the issue of inflectional predictability in terms of predictions of wordforms from one another, without assuming a given segmentation in stems vs. endings, in a fully word-based, abstractive AUTHOR approach. %Within this framework, Stump and Finkel (2013) focus on Principal Parts – i.e., sets of inflected wordforms that allow to infer all the remaining inflected wordforms of a lexeme. On the other hand, Within this framework, AUTHOR propose to estimate the reliability of inflectional predictions by means of the information-theoretic notion of conditional entropy. Building on this work, AUTHOR outline a procedure that allows to compute entropy values estimating the uncertainty in predicting one cell from another one directly from a lexicon of fully inflected wordforms in phonological transcription, using the type frequency of different inflectional patterns to estimate their probability of application. This method has been applied to French by AUTHOR, to Latin by AUTHOR, and it has been used for typological comparison on a small sample of languages by AUTHOR, who also provides a freely available toolkit (Qumin) allowing to perform this computation automatically for any language. A similar entropy-based analysis has not been proposed for Italian yet. To be able to use the Qumin toolkit to perform it, it is necessary to have an inflected lexicon listing all the wordforms of a representative number of lexemes in phonological transcription, like e.g. Flexique for French AUTHOR or LatInflexi for Latin AUTHOR. Looking for such a resource for Italian, we can see that in most lexicons wordforms are given in orthographic transcription – see e.g. Morph-it! AUTHOR and CoLFIS AUTHOR. On the other hand, in PhonItalia AUTHOR there are phonological transcriptions, but not all the inflected wordforms of each lexeme are listed. To the best of our knowledge, the only resource providing phonological transcriptions of the full paradigm of lexemes is GLAFF-IT AUTHOR, but due to the way in which it was created, it proves to be too noisy to be used for entropy computations as such. In this paper, we describe the work that was done to obtain a smaller, but cleaner version of GLAFF-IT. We then use this resource to perform an entropy-based analysis of predictability in Italian verb inflection. After briefly describing the methodology, we present our results comparing them with the findings of previous stem-based analyses.","In this paper, we have presented the inflected lexicon of Italian verbs LeFFI. We have then exploited it to investigate predictability in Italian verb inflection, using implicative entropy to estimate the uncertainty in predicting wordforms from one another. The results have been used to obtain a mapping of the paradigm in zones of interpredictability, that we have compared to the mapping of stems proposed in previous work, showing that our word-based procedure is capable of capturing aspects that are downplayed, if not ignored in the stem-based approach. Besides their theoretical interest, both the resource and the information-theoretic approach potentially have more practical applications, for instance in the field of psycholinguistics. The resource provides a very clean but sufficiently large dataset of forms that can be used as a source of input for fine-grained experiments. In such experiments, it would be possible to test if the different levels of predictability between cells identified by different values of implicative entropy find a correspondence in the process of acquisition of inflectional morphology by L1 and L2 speakers – i.e., if the pairs of cells between which there are higher implicative entropy values are indeed the ones on which learners are more uncertain. More generally, our entropy-based evaluation of uncertainty in inflectional predictions can be considered as a measure of (at least one aspect of) morphological complexity, that can be used also in other areas, for instance to asses text readibility.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Recent works on diachronic embeddings show that computational approaches to the diachronic analysis of language seem to be promising, but they are not user friendly for people without a technical background. This paper presents the Diachronic Engine, a system for the diachronic analysis of corpora lexical features. Diachronic Engine computes word frequency, concordances and collocations taking into account the temporal dimension. It is also able to compute temporal word embeddings and time-series that can be exploited for lexical semantic change detection.","Synchronic corpora are widely used in linguistics for deriving a set of abstract rules that govern a particular language under analysis by using statistical approaches. The same methodology can be adopted for analyzing the evolution of word meanings over time in the case of diachronic corpora. However, this process can be very time-consuming. Usually, linguists rely on software tools that can easily explore and clean the corpus, while highlighting the more relevant linguistic features. Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al., 2004; Kilgarriff et al., 2014) is the leading tool in the corpus analysis field. Beyond several interesting features, Sketch Engine includes trends (Kilgarriff et al., 2015), which allow for diachronic analysis based on the frequency distribution of words. Trends rely on merely frequency features, ignoring word usage information. Moreover, the Sketch Engine interface does not provide temporal information about concordances and collocations. NoSketchEngine is an open-source version of SketchEngine. It requires technical expertise for the setup and, contrarily to SketchEngine, it does not support word sketches, terminology, thesaurus, n-grams, trends and corpus building. An interesting system is DiaCollo (Jurish and der Wissenschaften, 2015), a software tool for the discovery, comparison, and interactive visualization of target word combinations. Combinations can be requested for a particular time period, or for a direct comparison between different time periods. However, DiaCollo is focused exclusively on the extraction and visualization of collocations from diachronic corpora. In recent works about computational diachronic linguistics, techniques based on word embeddings produce promising results. In Semeval Task 1 (Schlechtweg et al., 2020), for instance, type embeddings rich high performances on both subtasks. However, these techniques are not included in any aforementioned linguistic tool. In order to bridge this gap, we try to build a tool that includes approaches for the analysis of diachronic embeddings. The result of our work is Diachronic Engine (DE), an engine for the management of diachronic corpora that provides tools for change detection of lexical semantics from a frequentist perspective. DE includes tools for extracting diachronic collocations, concordances in different time periods as well as for computing semantic change time-series by exploiting both word frequencies and word embeddings similarity over time. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the technical details of DE, while Section 3 shows some use cases of our engine that encompass that address time-series. We also present the results of a preliminary evaluation about the system’s usability in Section 4. Conclusions and future work close the paper.","In this paper, we present the Diachronic Engine, a tool for the analysis of lexical semantic change. DE integrates and extends current tools for corpus analysis enabling the study of corpus diachronic features. DE includes tools not included in other systems, such as time-series and change points detection based on diachronic word embeddings. As future work, we plan to provide pre-loaded corpora such as Google Ngram, Diacoris (Onelli et al., 2006) and the integration of other approaches for computing diachronic word embeddings. Moreover, we plan to add a tool for the annotation of lexical-semantic shifts inspired by DUREL (Schlechtweg et al., 2018).",5,Latin Resources

Our approach relies on a natural language processing pipeline that exploits distributional semantics models to identify the most relevant aspects for each different context of consumption of the item. Next, these aspects are used to identify the most suitable pieces of information to be combined in a natural language justification. As information source, we used a corpus of reviews. Accordingly, our justifications are based on a combination of reviews' excerpts that discuss the aspects that are particularly relevant for a certain context. In the experimental evaluation, we carried out a user study in the movies domain in order to investigate the validity of the idea of adapting the justifications to the different contexts of usage. As shown by the results, all these claims were supported by the data we collected.","Recommender Systems (RSs) AUTHOR are now recognised as a very effective mean to support the users in decision-making tasks AUTHOR. However, as the importance of such technology in our everyday lives grows, it is fundamental that these algorithms support each suggestion through a justification that allows the user to understand the internal mechanisms of the recommendation process and to more easily discern among the available alternatives. To this end, several attempts have been recently devoted to investigate how to introduce explanation facilities in RSs AUTHOR and to identify the most suitable explanation styles AUTHOR. Despite such a huge research effort, none of the methodologies currently presented in literature diversifies the justifications based on the different contextual situations in which the item will be consumed. This is a clear issue, since context plays a key role in every decision-making task, and RSs are no exception. Indeed, as the mood or the company (friends, family, children) can direct the choice of the movie to be watched, so a justification that aims to convince a user to enjoy a recommendation should contain different concepts depending on whether the user is planning to watch a movie with her friends or with her children. In this paper we fill in this gap by proposing an approach to generate a context-aware justification that supports a recommendation. Our methodology exploits distributional semantics models AUTHOR to build a term-context matrix that encodes the importance of terms and concepts in each context of consumption. Such a matrix is used to obtain a vector space representation of each context, which is in turn used to identify the most suitable pieces of information to be combined in a justification. As information source, we used a corpus of reviews. Accordingly, our justifications are based on a combination of reviews' excerpts that discuss with a positive sentiment the aspects that are particularly relevant for a certain context. Beyond its context-aware nature, another distinctive trait of our methodology is the fact that we generate post-hoc justifications that are completely independent from the underlying recommendation models and completely separated from the step of generating the recommendations. To sum up, we can summarize the contributions of the article as follows: (i) we propose a methodology based on distributional semantics models and natural language processing to automatically learn a vector space representation of the different contexts in which an item can be consumed; (ii) We design a pipeline that exploits distributional semantics models to generate context-aware natural language justifications supporting the suggestions returned by any recommendation algorithm; The rest of the paper is organized as follows: first, in Section 2 we provide an overview of related work. Next, Section 3 describes the main components of our workflow and Section 4 discusses the outcomes of the experimental evaluation. Finally, conclusions and future work of the current research are provided in Section 5.","In this paper we presented a methodology that exploits DSMs to build post-hoc context-aware natural language justifications supporting the suggestions generated by a RS. The hallmark of this work is the diversification of the justifications based on the different contextual settings in which the items will be consumed, which is a new research direction in the area. As shown in our experiments, our justifications were largely preferred by users. This confirms the effectiveness of our approach and paves the way to several future research directions, such as the definition of personalized justification as well as the generation of hybrid justifications that combine elements gathered from usergenerated content (as the reviews) with descriptive characteristics of the items. Finally, we will also evaluate the use of ontologies and rules (Laera et al., 2004) in order to implement reasoning mechanisms to better identify the most relevant aspects in the reviews.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

Arguments play in fact a fundamental role in verb meaning and verbal polysemy, thanks to the sense co-composition principle between verb and argument. For this reason, clustering of lexical items filling the Object slot of a verb is believed to bring to surface relevant information about verbal meaning and the verb-Objects relation. The paper presents the results of an experiment comparing the automatic clustering of direct Objects operated by the agglomerative hierarchical algorithm of the Sketch Engine corpus tool with the manual clustering of direct Objects carried out in the T-PAS resource. Cluster analysis is here used to improve the semantic quality of automatic clusters against expert human intuition and as an investigation tool of phenomena intrinsic to semantic selection of verbs and the construction of verb senses in context.","Clustering techniques have been used extensively in recent decades in Linguistics and NLP, especially in Word Sense related tasks. As a matter of fact, partitioning data sets on the basis of their similarity at a distributional level clarifies the meaning of lexical elements (Brown et al., 1991). Partitioning verbal arguments, for example, can be beneficial to investigate the sense properties they share but also to explore verbal meaning. In fact, as highlighted by Pustejovsky (1995, 2002), the semantics of each verb is determined by the totality of its complementation patterns and arguments play a fundamental role in verb meaning and verbal polysemy, thanks to the sense co-composition principle. Id est, the process of bilateral semantic selection between the verb and its complement gives rise to a novel sense of the verb in each context of use (ibidem). Clustering lexical items filling the argument positions of a verb is then believed to bring to surface relevant information about verbal meaning and the verb-arguments relation. Clustering them, and especially direct Objects in pro-drop languages such as Italian, allows hence to investigate how to better induce, discriminate and disambiguate verb senses. Because argument fillers share the same semantic nature, they can be grouped and generalized with respect to their content and be associated with semantic types, i.e. empirically identified semantic classes representing selectional properties and preferences of verbs. Clustering of Objects can therefore be used as a survey tool for the intrinsic phenomena of semantic classes and, at the same time, as an object of investigation to improve the clustering automatic models themselves against human partitioning. This paper presents the results of an experiment comparing manual and automatic clustering of Italian Object fillers to be used in verb-sense identification and, along with it, it describes the linguistic phenomena that emerged from the semantic analysis of non-supervised clusters. The comparison concerns the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm of the Sketch Engine corpus tool1 (Kilgarriff et al., 2014) and the manual clustering carried out in the T-PAS resource2 (Ježek at al., 2014), in which verbal senses are identified in context based on the fillers of the argument positions (see section 1.1) and are annotated with a semantic type (ST; see section 1.2) able to identify them. Thanks to their semantic generalization properties, ST are also believed to represent a useful comparative tool between manual and automatic clustering. After presenting the theoretical background of the research, section 2 will cover data, method and work pipeline, while clustering evaluation via metrics and linguistic analysis will be presented in section 3.","The paper presented the statistical and linguistic results of a comparison between SkE unsupervised clustering model and the manual and verb-sense oriented clustering of T-PAS. It highlighted how the noun-oriented model and the verb-oriented one are not overlapping if not partially. The SkE clustering, even if not overlapping, can still be considered as internally compatible with the T-PAS partition, since the homogeneity metric reaches good results. The internal linguistic analysis allowed to identify the semantic quality through the consistency with a semantic type, the internal homogeneity, the adherence with the verb-oriented approach of T-PAS. The reasons that regulate the fragmentation of clusters in SkE, i.e. motivations that follow a fine-grained logic, were then presented. The analysis made possible to shed a light on the semantic compatibility between the two approaches, which seem to pertain to different levels of granularity. The difference in the partition output and the parallel semantic compatibility allows us to claim that the SkE automatic clustering is more useful for the internal investigation of STs than to investigate the verb-Object co-composition relation. It would be interesting to conduct further comparisons between other automatic clustering techniques and that of T-PAS, to investigate additional semantic implications of clustering through noun-based and verb-based approaches.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Although current task-oriented dialogue systems are good at providing information explicitly requested by the user, they are poor in exhibiting proactivity, which is typical in human-human interactions. In this study, we investigate the presence of proactive behaviours in several available dialogue collections, both human-human and human-machine and show how the data acquisition decision affects the proactive behaviour present in the dataset. We adopt a two-step approach to semi-automatically detect proactive situations in the datasets, where proactivity is not annotated, and show that the dialogues collected with approaches that provide more freedom to the agent/user, exhibit high proactivity.","Proactivity is the collaborative attitude of humans to offer information in a dialogue even when such information was not explicitly requested. As an example, a travel operator may suggest points of interest and attractions in a certain area, even if the customer did not explicitly requested for them. The following portion of dialogue, extracted from the Nespole dataset AUTHOR, shows proactive contributions of the travel agent (displayed in italics). Client: good morning; could you suggest any village in the Val di Fiemme to me; where it's possible to skate for example; that is does any skating rink exist in the Val di Fiemme; Agent: yes; in the whole of Val di Fiemme there are some outdoor skating rinks; where you can skate usually in the afternoon; in some rinks even in the morning; and then right in Cavalese there's a skating rink an ice rink; where even some courses are organized; where they also hold hockey or skating shows; and it's indoors. In this dialogue situation the travel agent provides indications both about the opening time of skating rinks and about skating courses, which were not requested by the customer. We may think proactivity as a guess of the agent with respect to the customer needs, with the purpose of anticipating expected requests, this way facilitating the achievements of the dialogue goals. Proactivity is a crucial characteristics of human-human dialogues. It is related to the so called principles of cooperative dialogue, which have been summarized in the popular Grice's maxims AUTHOR. In particular, proactivity follows the maxim of quantity, where one tries to be as informative as one possibly can, and gives as much information as it is needed, and no more. Under this maxim, proactivity has to find a trade-off between providing useful not requested information and limiting excessive not needed information. For instance, in the context of our dialogue about skating in Val di Fiemme, an agent suggesting a good pizzeria would probably be perceived as a violation of the quantity maxim, as this information seems not enough needed in that context. Despite the large use of proactivity that we note in everyday human-human dialogues, proactive behaviours are poorly represented in most of the models at the core of the last generation of task-oriented dialogue systems. Overall, we notice a general lack of cooperative phenomena (e.g., clarification questions, explanatory dialogues, proactivity, etc.), that characterize, and somehow make efficient, task-oriented human-human dialogues. A notable exception are recommendation systems AUTHOR, where, however, the focus is on influencing the user towards a specific goal (e.g., buy a certain product). Instead, we intend proactivity to be a general collaborative strategy aiming at improving the quality and effectiveness of the conversation. As an example, proactivity can be used to anticipate future requests of the user (e.g., providing the telephone number of a certain restaurant), or to recover from failure situations (e.g., offering possible alternatives when there are no restaurants satisfying the user desires). The main purpose of the paper is to conduct an empirical analysis over several existing task-oriented dialogue datasets, used to train dialogue models, in order to verify the presence of proactive behaviours. More specifically, we consider a human-human dialogue corpus collected with a role-taking methodology, i.e., Nespole, and compare it with other task-oriented dialogues collected either with Wizard of Oz or with bootstrapping methods. To conduct such a comparison, the major obstacle is that in both cases, proactivity is not annotated in any way, and we had to figure out methods (addressed in Section methodology) to semi-automatically detect proactive situations. Results confirm that dialogues collected through role-taking methodology show a much richer presence of proactivity, which is a challenge for future dialogue systems.","Task-oriented dialogue systems have shown to be effective in providing services to users with a high success rate. However, the interaction still lacks an effective proactive approach, which is typical in human-human conversations. In this study, we compare proactive behaviours in several available dialogue datasets, and show that the dialogues collected through Wizard of Oz contain a small proportion of system proactive responses, while dialogues collected through simulation-based and role-taking methodologies contain higher degree of proactivity. To sum up, we suggest that data collection strategies should be better aware that their designing principles have strong influence on the quality of the dialogues. Particularly, we recommend higher attention to proactive behaviours, and, in general, to collaborative phenomena.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

It is formulated as a normal form game in which words are represented as players and topics as strategies that the players select. The strategies of each player are modelled with a probability distribution guided by a utility function that the players try to maximize. This function induces players to select strategies similar to those selected by similar players and to choice strategies not shared with those selected by dissimilar players. The proposed framework is compared with state-of-the-art models demonstrating good performances on standard benchmarks.,"Topic modeling is a technique that discovers the underlying topics contained in a collection of documents AUTHOR. It can be used in different tasks of text classification, document retrieval, and sentiment analysis, providing together vector representations of words and documents. State-of-the-art systems are based on probabilistic AUTHOR and neural networks models AUTHOR. A different perspective based on game theory is proposed in this article. The use of game-theoretic principles in machine learning AUTHOR, pattern recognition AUTHOR and natural language processing AUTHOR problems is developing a promising field of research with the development of original models. The main difference between computational models based on optimization techniques and game-theoretic models is that the former tries to maximize (minimize) a function (that in many cases is non-convex) and the latter tries to find the equilibrium state of a dynamical system. The equilibrium concept is useful because it represents a state in which all the constraints of a given system are satisfied and no object of the system has an incentive to deviate from it, because a different configuration will immediately lead to a worse situation in terms of payoff and fitness, at object and system level. Furthermore, it is guaranteed that the system converges to a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium AUTHOR. So far, game-theoretic models have been used in classification and clustering tasks AUTHOR. In this work, it is proposed a game-theoretic model for inferring a low dimensional representation of words that can capture their latent semantic representation. In this work, topic modeling is interpreted as a symmetric non-cooperative game AUTHOR in which, the words are the players and the topics are the strategies that the players can select. Two players are matched to play the games together according to the co-occurrence patterns found in the corpus under study. The players use a probability distribution over their strategies to play the games and obtain a payoff for each strategy. This reward helps them to adjust their strategy selection in future games, considering what strategy has been effective in previous games. It allows concentrating more mass on the strategies that get high reward. The underlying idea to model the payoff function is to create two influence dynamics, the first one forces similar players (words that appear in similar contexts) to select similar strategies; the second one forces dissimilar players (words that do not share any context) to select different strategies. The games are played repeatedly until the system converges, that is, the difference among the strategy distributions of the players at time t and at time t-1 is under a small threshold. The convergence of the system corresponds to an equilibrium, a situation in which there is an optimal association of words and topics.","In this paper, it is presented a new topic modeling framework based on game-theoretic principles. The results of its evaluation show that the model performs well compared to state-of-the-art systems and that it can extract topically and semantically related groups of words. In this work, the model was left as simple as possible to assess if a game-theoretic framework itself is suited for topic modeling. In future work, it will be interesting to introduce the topic-document distribution and to test it on classification tasks and covariates to extract topics using different dimensions, such as time, authorship, or opinion. The framework is open and flexible and in future work, it will be tested with different initializations of the strategy space, graph structures, and payoff functions. It will be particularly interesting to test it using word embedding and syntactic information.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

The corpus is built exploiting Distant Supervision, assigning Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) labels to YouTube comments, and can lend itself to a variety of experiments. We report on preliminary experiments on Personal-ITY, which can serve as a baseline for future work, showing that some types are easier to predict than others, and discussing the perks of cross-dataset prediction.","When faced with the same situation, different humans behave differently. This is, of course, due to different backgrounds, education paths, and life experiences, but according to psychologists there is another important aspect: personality AUTHOR. Human Personality is a psychological construct aimed at explaining the wide variety of human behaviours in terms of a few, stable and measurable individual characteristics AUTHOR. Such characteristics are formalised in Trait Models, and there are currently two of these models that are widely adopted: Big Five AUTHOR and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) AUTHOR. The first examines five dimensions (Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism) and for each of them assigns a score in a range. The second one, instead, considers 16 fixed personality types, coming from the combination of the opposite poles of 4 main dimensions (Extravert-Introvert, iNtuitive-Sensing, Feeling-Thinking, Perceiving-Judging). Examples of full personality types are therefore four letter labels such as ENTJ or ISFP. The tests used to detect prevalence of traits include human judgements regarding semantic similarity and relations between adjectives that people use to describe themselves and others. This is because language is believed to be a prime carrier of personality traits AUTHOR. This aspect, together with the progressive increase of available user-generated data on social media, has prompted the task of Personality Detection, i.e., the automatic prediction of personality from written texts AUTHOR. Personality detection can be useful in predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes and physical health. Other fields of application are marketing, politics and psychological and social assessment. As a contribution to personality detection in Italian, we present Personal-ITY, a new corpus of YouTube comments annotated with MBTI personality traits, and some preliminary experiments to highlight its characteristics and test its potential. The corpus is made available to the community.","The experiments show that there is no single best model for personality prediction, as the feature contribution depends on the dimension considered, and on the dataset. Lexical features perform best, but they tend to be strictly related to the context in which the model is trained and so to overfit. The inherent difficulty of the task itself is confirmed and deserves further investigations, as assigning a definite personality is an extremely subjective and complex task, even for humans. Personal-ITY is made available to further investigate the above and other issues related to personality detection in Italian. The corpus can lend itself to a psychological analysis of the linguistic cues for the MBTI personality traits. On this line, it is interesting to investigate the presence of evidences linking linguistic features with psychological theories about the four considered dimensions (EXTRAVERT-INTROVERT, INTUITIVE-SENSING, FEELING-THINKING, PERCEIVING-JUDGING). First results in this direction are presented in (Bassignana et al., 2020).",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

The segmentation of subtitles into phrases or linguistic units is key to their readability and comprehension. However, automatically segmenting a sentence into subtitles is a challenging task and data containing reliable human segmentation decisions are often scarce. In this paper, we leverage data with noisy segmentation from large subtitle corpora and combine them with smaller amounts of high-quality data in order to train models which perform automatic segmentation of a sentence into subtitles. We show that even a minimum amount of reliable data can lead to readable subtitles and that quality is more important than quantity for the task of subtitle segmentation.","In a world dominated by screens, subtitles are a vital means for facilitating access to information for diverse audiences. Subtitles are classified as interlingual (subtitles in a different language as the original video) and intralingual (of the same language as the original video) AUTHOR. Viewers normally resort to interlingual subtitles because they do not speak the language of the original video, while intralingual subtitles (also called captions) are used by people who cannot rely solely on the original audio for comprehension. Such viewers are, for example, the deaf and hard of hearing and language learners. Apart from creating a bridge towards information, entertainment and education, subtitles are a means to improving the reading skills of children and immigrants AUTHOR. Having such a large pool of users and covering a wide variety of functions, subtitling is probably the most dominant form of Audiovisual Translation. Subtitles, however, in order to fulfil their purposes as described above, need to be presented on the screen in a way that facilitates readability and comprehension. AUTHOR claim that subtitles which cannot be read or can be read only with difficulty `are almost as bad as no subtitles at all'. Creating readable subtitles comes with several challenges. The difficulty imposed by the transition to a different semiotic means, which takes place when transcribing or translating the original audio into text, is further exacerbated by the limitations of the medium (time and space on screen). Subtitles should not exceed a maximum length, usually ranging between 35-46 characters, depending on screen size and audience age or preferences. They should also be presented at a comfortable reading speed for the viewer. Moreover, chucking or segmentation, i.e. the way a subtitle is split across the screen, has a great impact on comprehension. Studies have shown that a proper segmentation can balance gazing behaviour and subtitle reading AUTHOR. Each subtitle should -- if possible -- have a logical completion. This is equivalent to a segmentation by phrase, sentence or unit of information. Where and if to insert a subtitle break depends on several factors such as speech rhythm, pauses but also semantic and syntactic properties. This all makes segmenting a full sentence into subtitles a complex and challenging problem. Developing automatic solutions for subtitle segmentation has long been impeded by the lack of representative data. Line breaks are the new lines inside a subtitle block, which are used to split a long subtitle into two shorter lines. This type of breaks is not present in the subtitle files used to create large subtitling corpora such as OpenSubtitles AUTHOR and corpora based on TED Talks AUTHOR, possibly because of encoding issues and the pre-processing of the subtitles into parallel sentences AUTHOR. Recently, MuST-Cinema AUTHOR, a corpus based on TED Talks, was released, which added the missing line breaks from the subtitle files (.srt}) using an automatic annotation procedure. This makes MuST-Cinema a high-quality resource for the task of subtitle segmentation. However, the size of MuST-Cinema (about 270k sentences) might not be sufficient for developing automatic solutions based on data-hungry neural-network approaches, and its language coverage is so far limited to 7 languages. On the other hand, the OpenSubtitles corpus, despite being rather noisy, constitutes a large resource of subtitling data. In this work, we leverage available subtitling resources in different resource conditions %ask the question of what amount and quality of data is necessary to train models which automatically segment sentences into readable subtitles. The goal is to exploit the advantages of the available resources, i.e. size for OpenSubtitles and quality for MuST-Cinema, for maximising segmentation performance, but also taking into account training efficiency and cost. %address the problem of subtitle segmentation, creating a model that, given a full sentence, generates readable subtitles. We experiment with a sequence-to-sequence model, which we train and fine-tune on different amounts of data. More specifically, we hypothesise the condition where data containing high-quality segmentation decisions is scarce or non-existent and we resort to existing resources (OpenSubtitles). We show that high-quality data, representative of the task, even in small amounts, are a key to finding the break points for readable subtitles.",We have presented methods to combine heterogeneous subtitling data in order to improve automatic segmentation of subtitles. We leverage large data containing noisy segmentation decisions from OpenSubtitles and combine them with smaller amounts of high-quality data from MuSTCinema to generate readable subtitles from full sentences. We found that even limited data with reliable segmentation can improve performance. We conclude that quality matters more than size for determining the break points between subtitles.,1,Language Models

Recently some new models especially developed for Italian became available to scholars. This work aims at evaluating the impact of these models in enhancing application performance for Italian establishing the new state-of-the-art for some fundamental NLP tasks.,"The introduction of contextualised word embeddings, starting with ELMo AUTHOR and in particular with BERT AUTHOR and the subsequent BERT-inspired transformer models AUTHOR, marked a strong revolution in Natural Language Processing, boosting the performance of almost all applications and especially those based on statistical analysis and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). A recent study AUTHOR tried to determine the new baselines for several NLP tasks for English fixing the new state-of-the-art for the examined tasks. This work aims at doing a similar process also for Italian. We considered a number of relevant tasks applying state-of-the-art neural models available to the community and fed them with all the contextualised word embeddings specifically developed for Italian.","The starting idea of this work was to derive the new state-of-the-art for some NLP tasks for Italian after the ‘BERT-revolution’ thanks to the recent availability of Italian BERT-derived models. Looking at the results presented in previous sections for some very important tasks, we can certainly conclude that BERT-derived models, specifically trained on Italian texts, allow for a large increase in performance also for some important Italian NLP tasks. On the contrary, the multilingual BERT model developed by Google was not able to produce good results and should not be used when are available specific models for the studied language. A side, and sad, consideration that emerges from this study regards the complexity of the models. All the DNN models used in this work for the various tasks involved very simple fine-tuning processes of some BERT-derived model. Machine learning and Deep learning changed completely the approaches to NLP solutions, but never before we were in a situation in which a single methodological approach can solve different NLP problems always establishing the state-of-the-art for that problem. And we did not apply any parameter tuning at all! The only optimisation regards the early stopping definition on validation set. By tuning all the hyperparameters, it is reasonable we can further increase the overall performance. For the future, it would be interesting to evaluate end-to-end systems, for example for solving PoS-tagging + Parsing and PoS-tagging + NER by using the BERT-derived model fine tuning code and PaT for both end-to-end tasks. A lot of scholars are working in studying new transformer-based models or training the most promising ones on different languages; there are brand new Italian models that were made available very recently not yet included into our evaluations like the one produced by Stefan Schweter at CIS, LMU Munich; it would be interesting to insert them into our tests.",1,Language Models

The experimental evaluations show that the adopted methods based on neural word embeddings pave the way for the assisted development of a large scale lexical resource for our language.","When dealing with large-scale lexical resources, such as FrameNet AUTHOR, PropBank AUTHOR, VerbNet AUTHOR or VerbAtlas AUTHOR, the semi-automatic association between predicates and lexical items (also known as Lexical Units or LUs) is crucial to improve the coverage of a resource while limiting the costs of its manual annotation. Several approaches to this semi-supervised task exist, as discussed in AUTHOR. In particular, AUTHOR exploited distributional models of lexical meaning AUTHOR to induce new LUs consistently with the Frame Semantics theory AUTHOR, representing words meaning and semantic frames through geometrical word spaces. As a result, this approach allows to induce new LUs when applied to the English version of FrameNet. However, this is a quite consolidated resource with many existing LUs connected to each semantic predicate, i.e., each frame. The applicability of this method in scenarios where only one or two LUs are available for each frame is still an open issue. At the same time, since the work of AUTHOR, the application of neural approaches to the acquisition of word embeddings AUTHOR significantly improved in terms both of representation capability and scalability of geometrical models of lexical semantics. In this paper we thus investigate the applicability of the method proposed in AUTHOR to boost the coverage of a novel and still limited lexical resource based on Frame Semantics in Italian. This resource has been developed within the IFrameNet (IFN) project AUTHOR, which aims at creating a large coverage FrameNet-like resource for Italian and to come up with a complete dictionary in which every lexical entry we denote a lemma, with its Part of Speech tag, that activates at least one LU.} is linked to all the frames it can evoke (i.e., the frames for which it is a LU). At this moment, while the resource counts more than 7,700 lexical items associated to more than 1,048 frames, each lexical item is connected, on average, to only 1.3 frames, and it is problematic if considering the high polysemy of Italian words AUTHOR. The experimental evaluation shows that neural word embeddings enable the effective application of the distributional approach from AUTHOR to improve the coverage of IFN. Moreover, the adopted distributional framework allowed to develop a graphical semantic browser to support annotators while assigning new LUs to frames. This study paves the way to the semi-automatic development of IFN and investigates about the applicability of neural word embeddings to the incremental semi-automatic LU induction process.","In this work, we presented the actual state of the IFrameNet project, which aims at developing a large-scale lexical resource based on Frame Semantics in Italian. Moreover, we investigated the applicability of a method for the automatic Induction of FrameNet Lexical Units to improve the coverage of the actual resource, in terms of number of frames assigned to the almost 8,000 existing lexical entries. With respect to previous work, i.e., Pennacchiotti et al. (2008) we empirically demonstrate the beneficial impact of neural word embeddings in the overall workflow in Italian. The robustness of the adopted model is confirmed also when applied to a resource with a limited average number of frames associated to Lexical Units. The experimental evaluations in many cases showed the valuable support of the method in discovering new Lexical Units by suggesting novel evoked frames. Moreover, the error analysis suggested that most of the “discarded” frames still entertain various kinds of relationships with the “correct” ones as defined in FrameNet, such as Inheritance or Usage. In some cases, it also highlighted metaphorical meanings that the lexical entries could assume. As a future work, we will certainly exploit the produced IFrameNet Navigator to extend the current LU Italian dictionary, support the annotation of novel sentences and introduce frame-to-frame relations in Italian. Another path that might worth investigating is the exploitation of dependencybased word embeddings for the distributional representation of LUs and frames. This may beneficial since dependency-based contexts highlight more functional similarities (Levy and Goldberg, 2014). Finally, we plan to use the derived frame distributions to augment existing contextualized embeddings in support of Frame Induction (Sikos and Padó, 2019) or Semantic Role Labeling (Shi and Lin, 2019) tasks.",22,Distributional Semantics

Engagement has been annotated in terms of gain or loss of perceived attention from the audience, and this information has been aligned to the transcription of the speech from the guide. A preliminary analysis suggests that the level of engagement correlates with some specific linguistic features, opening up to possible future exploitation.","Understanding a message expressed through the speech channel in face-to-face interactions involves more than the ability to decipher a string of characters and to assign a meaning to words and sentences. The linguistic information conveyed by lexicon is only the tip of the iceberg: intonation, gesture, facial expression, gaze, body movement play a key role in spoken communication. By summing the information in all these complementary modalities acquired through different channels (i.e. auditory and visual systems), the human brain is capable to analyse and decode a message not only on the basis of the words it contains. Moreover, the vision modality enables the speaker to evaluate the effectiveness of his/her message on the audience. In fact, face-to-face interactions offer the possibility to have an on-line feedback from the addressee even without an ongoing active dialogue. Simply by interpreting unconscious signals accessible from the vision modality, such as body postures and movements, facial expressions, eye-gazes, the speaker can understand if the addressee is engaged with the discourse, and continuously fine-tune his/her communication strategy in order to keep the attention high in the audience. Engagement can be explained as the process by which two or more actors establish, maintain and end their perceived connection during interactions they jointly undertake AUTHOR. It is composed of a series of verbal and non verbal behaviours, useful to understand the involvement between the actors, and specifically between the actors and the content of their communication scene, and it can be used to provide evidence of the waning of connectedness AUTHOR. In this work we describe a pilot annotation of audience engagement during guided tours in cultural sites, by evaluating the observable behaviours of the visitors in response to the speech from the guide.

Beyond social-media conversations, assessing product reviews as positive or negative requires an understanding of both rhetorical and literary devices.

One reviewer commented, ``Well at last pens for us ladies to use\dots now all we need is ``for her"""" paper and I can finally learn to write!”. While this review seems positive and gave the product four stars, our understanding of the social climate today leads us to conclude that this review is sarcastic and should be classified as such. In social media communication, new slang words are introduced every day and emojis are often used to negate the sentiment of the text. In addition, stylistic devices and stylometric features are also often employed to convey a meaning opposite from its literal interpretation. While deep learning models can be very effective in their detection of sarcasm, they provide a ``black box” approach that gives linguists little to no insight into what features are characteristic of sarcasm. %The goal of our work is to shed a light on these features and determine the strongest indicators of sarcasm in social media.

In this paper, we have studied the use of two machine learning components to design personal assistants: intent classification, to understand the user request, and answer sentence selection, to carry out question answering from unstructured text. The evaluation results derived on five different real-world datasets, associated with different companies, show high accuracy for both tasks. This suggests that modern QA and dialog technology is effective for real-world tasks.","Help-desk applications use Machine Learning to classify user's request into intents. The information owned by companies generally is in free text form, from company's documents or websites. For example, corporate knowledge is typically encoded within documents in an unstructured way. This poses limitations on the effectiveness of standard information access. For example, searching documents by keywords is not a viable solution for the users, as they seldom can find an answer to their questions. The possibility of using QA systems to search for information on a corpus of documents, also through a dialogue system, offers an attractive solution for extracting the best information from the company knowledge bases. IMSL company offers virtual agents that can be retrained based on the customer needs. The agent is composed of many Natural Language Understanding components, such as classifiers that map each user utterance in input to their corresponding intent. However, since it is not possible to forecast all the intents corresponding to the questions that the user are going to ask -- which are potentially infinite -- it is of paramount importance to have an automated QA system able to automatically provide the best answer (paragraph) extracted from a company owned knowledge base. Information access is becoming an increasingly critical issue. Traditional Information Retrieval systems, used in industry, help the user in accessing information, but are often imprecise and impractical. Current search engines are an example of this. Searching for information on the web often requires a double effort for the user: first it is necessary to understand how to formulate a query in the most effective manner, and then filter out the proposed results in order to find the most relevant information. In this paper, we described our QA system based on answer sentence selection and intent detection, and how we integrate them in a Conversational agent.","In this paper, we have presented a modern dialog system for real-world applications.

Sometimes data for a similar task is only available in another language because it may be very specific. In this paper, we explore the use of machine-translated data to transfer models on a related domain. Specifically, we transfer models from the question duplication task (QDT) to similar FAQ selection tasks. The source domain is the well-known English Quora dataset, while the target domain is a collection of small Italian datasets for real case scenarios consisting of FAQ groups retrieved by pivoting on common answers. Our results show great improvements in the zero-shot learning setting and modest improvements using the standard transfer approach for direct in-domain adaptation .","Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) websites are an essential service for user's self-assistance. FAQ websites typically present a list of questions, each associated with an answer. When searching for information, users have to go through the FAQs to determine whether there is a similar question providing a solution to their problem. However, this process does not scale well when the number of FAQs increases since too many questions may be presented to the user, and a simple search by the query may not retrieve the desired results. Additionally, in the last decade, users started looking for information using smartphones and voice assistants, such as Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri. By design, voice assistants provide users with a different information access paradigm: the FAQ websites' navigation service is substituted by natural language dialogues, which satisfy the users' information need in few interactions. To achieve this goal, FAQ retrieval systems need to understand the question and present the user only with a set of strong candidates. One possible solution offered by personal assistants is constituted by (i) a FAQ retrieval system AUTHOR for efficiently finding relevant questions, and (ii) accurate neural models to select the most probable FAQ. One of the major obstacles for building such a system is the availability of training data for the selection model. FAQ systems are domain-specific in nature since they aim to provide users with information about specific websites or services. Moreover, the industrial setting does not always allow for creating a large corpus of questions for any specific domain, as the customers (FAQ's owners) typically cannot provide such data. There are many reasons: (i) they are not familiar with the process of training data creation, as it is not part of their business; (ii) the topic of the FAQ system does not require more than tens of question/solution pairs; (iii) it is not easy to generate a dataset for question-question similarity from a question-answer system. A traditional approach to alleviating such a problem is to use transfer learning (TL), i.e., data from other domains/tasks is used to train a model on the target task. TL research has been boosted by the availability of pre-trained transformer-based models AUTHOR, which capture general-purpose language models. In this paper, we approach the problem of FAQ selection, fine-tuning pre-trained language models on the Question Duplication Task (QDT) from Quora}. This task aims to identify whether two questions are duplicated or not, i.e., semantically equivalent or not. AUTHOR. Although the FAQ selection task shares some commonalities with QDT one, they are different. A FAQ task can indeed be solved by ranking all the FAQs in the collection using a system that computes the semantic similarity score between two questions, i.e., a Paraphrase Identification model. However, there are still some crucial differences. While QDT requires to infer if two questions are semantically equivalent, FAQ selection seeks questions that share the same intent and, at the same time, that they share the same answer. Moreover, the FAQ selection strongly depends on the domain in which the retrieval system is applied. For example, if a website responds to every technical complaint with ``contact us'', there will be many positive pairs that will not share any real answer. Every portal in which a FAQ similarity system is needed, e.g., online services and e-commerce, requires a different level of details depending on the service type and its complexity. Table~tab:1 provides some examples taken from QDT and FAQ datasets to underline the difference better. One of the largest corpora for the fine-tuning of QDT is the well-known Quora dataset, sourced from the homonymous community question answering website. The dataset is constituted by question pairs, labeled as being duplicates or not. However, the Quora dataset is only available in the English language, preventing its use for building Italian systems. In this paper, we propose to adapt Transformer architectures to the task of FAQ selection using machine translation. We first translated the Quora dataset to Italian, and then we trained a state-of-the-art QDT model for Italian. Finally, we tested the adapted QDT model to two FAQ datasets showing significant improvement on the zero-shot learning baselines (i.e., using no target domain training data). Moreover, we show that fine-tuning the adapted model on small target data provides a consistent improvement over models not exploiting our transfer learning approach. It should be noted that our techniques can be seen as an extension of the Transfer and Adapt (TandA) AUTHOR, but with the difference that transfer is carried out on a similar approximate task using translated data, i.e., Approximated machine Translated TandA (ATTandA). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section sec:related describes similar approaches to do Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning, Section sec:dataset provides an overview of the available datasets and Section sec:method describes the methodology we developed. Finally, Section sec:results summarizes the main results and Section sec:conclusion draws the conclusions of this work.","We explored transfer learning in a typical industrial scenario where only small (or no) data is available in the target language. We showed that it is possible to use machine translated data to improve a strictly related task’s performance. We suspect that if the tasks had been more similar, for example, Question Answering and FAQ, the performance gain would have been even better. However, this was a real-world scenario where the target datasets were used for production in real websites, and size and quality were not large. In this setting, applying a transfer phase can improve the retrieval of similar questions, and the transfer step is a low-cost operation compared to the pretraining.",1,Language Models

The contribution sets out the objectives, the first results achieved and the development prospects.","There are now numerous digital text files that testify to historical varieties of Italian. However, access and questioning of texts are often elementary, mostly limited to the strings of characters that make up the text; this complicates the work of scholars and makes it almost impossible for non-experts to use resources. This situation shows that, despite recent progress in the field of Digital Humanities, the access and questioning of texts that testify historical varieties of Italian, more or less distant in time, still represent a challenge today. The project TRAVaSI (Automatic Treatment of Historical Varieties of Italian), born from the collaboration between the Institute of Computational Linguistics ""Antonio Zampolli"" and the Accademia della Crusca and funded by the Tuscany Region, aims to face this challenge, creating the prerequisites for navigation and the systematic questioning of sources that document the historical varieties of the language. The starting point of the project is pragmatic: to strengthen two instruments made by the Accademia della Crusca within other projects. The tools in question are the electronic version of the Grand Dictionary of Italian Language (GDLI) 1 and the database of the Dynamic Vocabulary of Modern Italian, which is more precisely the specific object of investigation of the contribution that we present here. TRAVaSI has as its main objective to maximize practical implementations, but projecting them in the framework of the development of reference tools for diacronically connotationd databases and historical dictionaries in electronic version. In particular, it is a question of exploiting the opportunity to work at the same time (and therefore to intersect researches, results and partial products) on the one hand on the structuring and marking of a historical dictionary such as the GDLI in its computerized version (by developing semi-automatic collation procedures of the text obtained with the OCR and marking of the identified structural fields; see Sassolini et alii 2019, Biffi and Sassolini 2020), and on the other on the creation of computational lexicons differentiated in diacronym to finally cover the weakening even to the zero degree of the effectiveness of linguistic annotation tools when we depart from the ideal conditions of contemporary Italian written those varieties substantially attributable to the sample of the Lexicon of frequency of contemporary Italian (LIF). And thus determine an enlargement of the effectiveness of the linguistic annotation tools in diacronia, diamesia and diaphasia. On the humanistic side, the developments of these instruments have considerable repercussions, both in the perspective of giving scholars methods of investigation increasingly powerful for their linguistic research, and in that, dear to an institution like the Accademia della Crusca, to reach a wider user. The digitization of the texts and their availability on the network are not enough to bring a user not limited to those involved in the work of the cultural heritage handed down. In order to make the contents of cultural institutions accessible to a wide and varied audience, it is necessary to offer ways of access and navigation equipped with linguistic intelligence. To date, it is widely recognized that the application of methods and techniques for the Automatic Treatment of Language (TAL) to historical varieties of a language presents innumerable obstacles, since the tools developed for modern languages require specializations at various levels (lexical, morphological and syntactical) to be successfully used in the treatment of primary sources that represent the basis of humanistic studies. For the Italian language, Pennacchiotti and Zanzotto (2008) report the results of an exploratory study on the difficulties resulting from the automatic treatment of historical varieties of the Italian language based on a diacronic corpus that collects literary Italian texts (both prose and poetry) from 1200 to the end of the nineteenth century: the analyses, focused on the composition of the vocabulary and on the morphological and morpho-syntactic annotation, confirm that the automatic treatment of historical varieties of the Italian language is an open challenge. One of the challenges that the TRAVaSI project intends to face. In this area, the project revolves around two main directions, concerning the construction of corpora enriched with linguistic information to be used for the evaluation and/or training of annotation tools, and diacronic computational lexicons able to support the process of lemmatization of the text. At the moment, the linguistic annotation of the texts concerns the morpho-syntactic level. The resources developed on both fronts will be integrated into existing research infrastructures (e.g. CLARIN-IT) in order to increase their visibility, accessibility and interoperability with similar resources. On the linguistic-computational side, the design and construction of resources and tools for the variety of use of the language that differ to a different extent from the contemporary Italian written on which the TAL instruments are typically trained constitutes a fertile field of experimentation for the development and refinement of innovative technologies of TAL. The article illustrates the methodology defined for the construction of resources and the first results achieved. Section 2 describes the diacronic corpus selected for the annotation, and Section 3 illustrates the method followed for the annotation of the corpus. Section 4 reports and discusses the results of the first semi-automatic annotation experiments and the review strategy developed. Section 5 illustrates the automatic annotation results achieved with existing annotation systems for contemporary Italian; finally, Section 6 outlines current and future developments.","We briefly illustrated the steps that the TRAVaSI project is following to build resources for the automatic treatment of historical Italian varieties, differentiated also in diaphasia, diaphasia and at textual level. In this preliminary phase we have tried to give answers to unsolved questions about the annotation and lemmatization of Italian in diacronia, for example on how to treat some forms (diversbate voices, infinite nouns, regional variants, to cite some examples) and on the criteria of lemmatization of the phono-morphological variants of the same lemma. The resources developed will be exploited to test existing instruments of morpho-syntactic annotation and lemmatization and for the development and/or specialization of software components for the treatment of historical varieties of the Italian language. The first results collected from the analysis of the VoDIM subcorpus selected clearly show that the dimensions of variation to be taken into account are multiple and strongly interrelated, deriving from different types of processes, such as the variation over time (diaconic variation), the variation related to sociolinguistic variables or linked to the textual genre or to the style of the writer. The places of variation range from spelling, morphology and syntax (especially in diacronya and texts of specialist domains). This type of analysis is fundamental in order to define a methodology for the creation of additional resources, with the aim of progressively widening the chronological arc but also the type of variety of use of the language in order to be able to build TAL instruments that are applicable to Italian texts of the previous centuries, attributable to different varieties of use of the language. From this perspective, the corpus selected as the starting point of the TRAVaSI project becomes particularly significant as it creates the prerequisites for the definition of a method for the specialization of annotation tools in relation to multiple linguistic, diacronic but also diaphasic, diastatic or corresponding to textual types. The current developments include: 1. training and specialization of UDPipe models by means of a test set consisting of the test corpus domains, on which, from time to time, the increase in accuracy of the annotation will be evaluated; 2. the construction of diacronic lexicons starting from annotated corporas starting from VoDIM and subsequently drawing from chronologically pre-existing resources as the basis for the lemmatization process; 3. on the basis of the distance between the corpus used for training and the texts to be analyzed, the identification of the most appropriate linguistic model to be used for linguistic annotation.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The numerous attempts that have been made to classify them <cit.> and the absence of an unequivocal taxonomy <cit.> contribute to the lack of a methodological approach for designing conversational agents. 

The recent technological developments have led to the standardisation of the technical frameworks: the main Natural Language Understanding (NLU) platforms, both developed by technology giants such as Google Dialogflow, IBM Watson, and Microsoft Luis and those from the open source community such as RASA, contributed to the affirmation of the dominant paradigm based on intents, entities and responses for building conversational agents <cit.>. The existing flourishing literature about this aspect <cit.> has not been associated with equivalent research on methods and linguistic theories that can be pursued for the design phase of conversational projects. During the survey of methodological studies on conversation design, it became clear that there is no shared standard and that various
methodological contributions of a practical nature do not refer to a specific theoretical linguistic perspective <cit.>. 

In this work we embrace the Natural Conversation Framework (NCF) whose validity has been already demonstrated in Dall'Acqua and Tamburini DAcquaTamburiniPRESS; we select some of its most representative patterns and we implemented them on the newly released version of Google Dialogflow CX. This paper is intended as a continuation of the work presented in Dall'Acqua, Tamburini DAcquaTamburiniPRESS, which sets out the theoretical and methodological assumptions on which this work is based.","We have demonstrated the applicability of this method also on the new released version of one of the most important Natural Language Understanding platform, namely Dialogflow CX.

This is therefore a further and more complete implementation of the pragmatic adequateness of this approach. 

In the future, we would like to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach on a fully functional prototype that can be adapted not only for commercial purposes, but also for other important application contexts, such as education. Due to the variety of frameworks available for the evaluation process <cit.>, the question of the most suitable evaluation method is still open for further discussion.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

There is a growing research and clinical interest in developing conversational agents (CA) for mental health support as Personal Healthcare Agents (PHA) <cit.>. However, the lack of appropriate domain knowledge has resulted in the abundance of rule-based dialogue systems in the mental health domain with shallow interactions and weak user engagement <cit.>. Currently available dialogue knowledge can be adequate for consumer-oriented agents or holding a free-topic social conversation. However, it can not be used to hold a dialogue about personal life-events and emotions. Meanwhile, patients' conversations in the mental health domain have a unique and complex structure since they encompass personal feelings and situations which vary across patients and interventions.

In order to carry out a personal conversation regarding the patient's life-events, it is essential to obtain the required knowledge during each interaction with the patient and from her Personal Narratives. Personal Narratives (PN) are recollections of thoughts and emotions about life-events of the patient. These narratives are used by the psychologist to identify the issues that have activated the patient's emotional state and provide support accordingly in order to reach a healthier mental status <cit.>.

 


 
 < g r a p h i c s >

 Each Personal Narrative (PN) is presented as a graph of patient's personal space of participants and events. Each edge and the adjacent nodes stand for an event and its corresponding participants in the narrative, respectively. Each edge (event), has an index based on its appearances in the PN which makes it possible to reconstruct the order of occurrences among the events. Moreover, events and participants extracted from prior narratives are considered less relevant for an ongoing interaction and have a lower importance score, presented by dashed lines.
 





In this work, we present an unsupervised approach, inspired by <cit.>, to automatically extract the life-events and their participants from the patient's PNs, and construct a Personal Space Graph. Figure <ref> represents the work flow of our model. Through the interaction with the patient, each narrative is parsed and presented in terms of its predicates (the events, the edges of the graph) and their noun dependencies (the participants, the nodes of the graph). Each edge has an index based on its order of appearance in the narrative which makes it possible to reconstruct the order of occurrences among the events (for instance, the event ""litigo spesso"" is mentioned after ""parla male""). Moreover, the events and participants mentioned in a recent narrative are considered to be more relevant for an ongoing interaction. Based on this assumption, older nodes and edges in the graph will become less relevant upon receiving a new narrative (presented by dashed lines in Figure <ref>). The obtained graph can be integrated with PHAs to automatically identify the life-event that is distressing the patient from hisher PNs to provide support and monitor its recurrence. 

We have evaluated our approach on a dataset of longitudinal Italian PNs collected from patients who were receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to manage their distress[This data collection has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Trento]. Besides, the English adaptation of our model was evaluated in the ""Story Cloze Test"" setting introduced by <cit.>. The results show that the proposed approach obtains similar results to other unsupervised models on the English dataset, and can be a strong baseline for personal space representation and response selection in Italian.","In this work, we present an approach to automatically extract life-events and participants from patients' Personal Narratives in the mental health domain and represent them as a personal graph.

We evaluated our model on a domain-specific dataset of Personal Narratives in Italian as well as an open-domain dataset of commonsense stories in English. The results indicate that our proposed model performs in-line with other unsupervised alternatives and can be a strong baseline for automatic extraction of life-events from Personal Narratives in Italian.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

However, with the advance of new information technologies and language variation, the contents and methods for PoS-tagging have changed. The majority of Italian existing data for this task originate from standard texts, where language use is far from multifaceted informal real-life situations. Automatic PoS-tagging models trained with such data do not perform reliably on non-standard language, like social media content or language learners’ texts. Our aim is to provide additional training and evaluation data from language learners tagged in Universal Dependencies (UD), as well as testing current automatic PoS-tagging systems and evaluating their performance on such data. We use Italian texts from a multilingual corpus of young language learners, LEONIDE, to create a tagged gold standard for evaluating UD PoS-tagging performance on non-standard language. With the 3.7 version of Stanza, a Python NLP package, we apply available automatic PoS-taggers, namely ISDT, ParTUT, POSTWITA, TWITTIRÒ and VIT, trained with diversified data, on our dataset. Our results show that the above taggers, trained on non-standard data or multilingual treebanks, can achieve up to 95% of accuracy on young multilingual learner data, if combined.","Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging relates to the assignment of tags or labels to the words, punctuation marks and symbols of a text. It constitutes a basic task in NLP, with applications ranging from machine translation to speech recognition and beyond. PoS-tags usually correspond to the morphosyntactic word classes of a given language, i.e. nouns, verbs, conjunctions, etc. Since each language contains specific linguistic characteristics that distinguish itself from others, tagsets are usually language dependent. The first automatic tool for the assignment of PoS-tags in the Italian language was the TreeTagger built at the University of Stuttgart (Schmid, 1994) to perform lemmatization and PoS-tagging contemporarily. Another milestone in the history of Italian PoS-tagging is the so-called Baroni's TreeTagger tagset, released in 2003. It represents the initially most adopted tagset, containing no less than 50 labels, half exclusively dedicated to verbs (Baroni et al., 2004). Along with the latter, Tanl (Attardi and Simi, 2009) constitutes an additionally relevant and comprehensive tagset for Italian. It counts with numerous tags and includes morphological word features. Three subcategories with different numbers of elements can be found in it, namely 14 coarse-grained tags, 37 fine-grained tags and 336 morphed tags.
Originally, automatic tagging methods were mainly employed with standard texts, such as
essays, literature, and newspaper articles (Del Monte et al., 2007; Baroni et al., 2004). However, with the advent of new communication systems and the expansion of language studies to more informal and common areas, attention started to shift to non-standard texts. In this regard, in several of the EVALITA periodic evaluation campaings for Italian NLP and speech tools, PoS tagging non-standard language has been a topic of interest (cf. Tamburini, 2007; Attardi and Simi, 2009; Bosco et al., 2016, Bosco et al., 2020). These tasks proved that PoS-tagging still represents an unsolved issue when it comes to less widely used language from different domains. Therefore, more studies and investigations are needed on specific language varieties.
Learner corpora exhibit a number of characteristics that differentiate them from the rest. In particular, numerous code-switching and code-mixing phenomena are common among them, as well as the presence of orthographical, syntactic and/or grammatical errors (Di Novo et al., 2019). More in detail, our data exhibited some peculiarities, for example the co-presence of variants for concepts (“Franco viene a casa e vede che fuocare/brenn”) or new words combining different languages and morphologies (“Se sarò un giocatore famoso richerò money”). Given these distinctive aspects, analysing them in the context of PoS-tagging can offer interesting insights from the point of view of both the conception of these systems and their linguistic implications.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides relevant details concerning the Universal Dependencies (UD), as well as available Italian treebanks and taggers. A brief overview about the differences in tagging standard and non-standard texts is presented in Section 3. Section 4 describes the methods and metrics commonly used for the evaluation of automatic taggers. We outline the tools and methodologies used for our experiments in Section 5 and the gold standard in Section 6. Next, in Section 7, we report the obtained results and in the subsequent section, namely 8, we discuss our findings, consider possible future works and draw our final conclusions.

Over the years, alongside the different taggers and treebanks of each language, a new language-independent framework in PoS annotation has emerged, the Universal Dependencies (UD). UD is a cross-linguistic project with the aim of building common annotation frameworks for several world languages. Underlying the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme are universal Stanford dependencies (Marneffe et al., 2008), Google universal PoS-tags (Petrov et al., 2011) and the Interset interlingua for morphosyntactic tagsets (cf. McDonald et al., 2013). In particular, for the Italian language, the UD counts seven different Treebanks. These are VIT, or the Venice Italian Treebank (Delmonte et al., 2007), ISDT, Italian Stanford Dependency Treebank (Bosco et al., 2014), ParTUT, or the Parallel Text Universal Treebank (Sanguinetti et al. 2014), PoSTwita (Bosco et al., 2016), TWITTIRÒ (Cignarella et al., 2018), Valico-UD (Di Novo et al., 2019) and PUD, or the Parallel Universal Dependencies Treebank (Zeman et al., 2018). The UD universal Italian tagset counts a total of 17 different labels (Universal Dependencies, 2021).
Pos-Tagging Standard vs Nonstandard Language
Among the various available treebanks and taggers for Italian, most have been created using exclusively standard data, such as newspaper articles, non-fictional texts, talks and Wikipedia pages for training the models (as in the case of VIT, ISDT, ParTUT and PUD). However, recently more attention has been placed on the creation of linguistic resources for nonstandard language, as the quantity and dissemination of this type of content increases exponentially, so does the need for suitable tools for its analysis and exploitation. In this respect, PoSTwita (Bosco et al., 2016) and TWITTIRÒ (Cignarella et al., 2018) resorted to additional non-standard Italian linguistic data from Twitter, while Valico-UD (Di Novo et al., 2019) used texts from Italian learners for the creation of their treebanks. Some of the main reasons why the use of standard language data outweighs that of nonstandard data are difficulties concerning the automatic processing and annotation of such texts. This applies especially when seeing the considerable amount of variation they contain, not only in the language itself, but also in the usage domains and among the individual language users (cf. Plank, 2016 and Sanguinetti et al. 2020). As a matter of fact, some distinctive features of non-standard texts are the broad variation in the structure and punctuation of utterances, namely in the syntax, but also at lexical level due to the use of abbreviations, domain-specific symbols or incorrect derivational forms, as well as code-switching for learners’ language. The latter are likely to lead to issues regarding both automatic language processing, such as tokenization and lemmatization, and PoS-tagging, especially in the case of non-suitable or incomplete standard treebanks. For these reasons, the creation of resources from non-standard texts, like social media users or language learners, is crucial.

Evaluation of Automatic PoS-Taggers
When it comes to evaluating the performance of a PoS-tagger, generally an annotated gold standard reference corpus is used. The latter requires a distribution of the particular linguistic phenomena that is representative of the PoS-tagger’s target application. Additionally, since a PoS-tagger combines several functions, like tokenization, word/sentence segmentation, and PoS-tag disambiguation, one of these parts must be firstly chosen as the test object. After selecting the aspect under analysis, it is necessary to choose which metrics to use to compare the results. The metrics commonly adopted for the evaluation of the tags assigned to a linguistic corpus are accuracy, precision, recall, F1-scores and Cohen’s K (cf. Arstein and Poesio, 2008). These metrics vary not only in terms of the aspects they measure but also according to the type of data that constitute the corpus and its size.
Although various available UD taggers for Italian exist, little is known about how these perform on non-standard data. Some evaluations have been done on user-generated texts in social media (Bosco et al. 2016; Cignarella et al. 2018) and recently also on spoken language (Bosco et al. 2020) and adult learners of Italian with English, French, German and Spanish as first languages (Di Novo et al. 2019). However, this is still a nascent process, and the number of studies and analysed varieties are limited. Therefore, a closer examination and evaluation of an automatic tagger on an additional non-standard resource from a different domain promises to enhance our knowledge about PoS-tagging.
Methodology
In this study, we evaluate automatic PoS-tagging on the LEONIDE corpus (Glaznieks et al., 2020) to investigate how existing tagging models trained with the already available Italian treebanks perform with data from young language learners.
Given the inaccessibility of an evaluation sample for UD PoS-tagging on Italian learner language, we built our own pre-tokenized gold standard sample (see Section 6). Once we had our gold standard, we created a processing pipeline to test available tagging models for Italian on our data. For this, we used Stanza, a Python natural language analysis package designed using the UD formalism, as it offered easy access to a number of pre-trained models for PoS-tagging UD in Italian. The following models have been used in our evaluation: ISDT, ParTUT, POSTWITA, TWITTIRÒ and VIT. In order to evaluate only the PoS-tag disambiguation step of the PoS-taggers, regardless from other steps such as tokenization, we tagged the pre-tokenized texts using Stanza but deactivated the tokenizer (tokenize_pretokenized=True) and selected a different model as parameter each time. With the results obtained from each model, we resorted to sklearn.metrics.classification_report and sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score to evaluate the total number of tags assigned to the more than 7,000 gold standard tokens according to accuracy and Cohen's K. In this way, the use of the exact same tokens and comparison metrics would have allowed an equal and meaningful comparison.
We closely focused on the accuracy and Cohen’s K values (cf. Artstein and Poesio, 2008) because the first allowed us to check the overall performance of the tagger as well as the results on each tag’s class, and the second to evaluate the similarity between the gold-standard and the automatically assigned tags.
As the available models had been trained on different data, both in quantity and type compared to each other but also compared to our corpus, it was particularly interesting to consider how they would deal with the young language learner data at hand, but also which type of errors they would make. We thus investigate common misclassifications for taggers and human annotators, discussing possible improvements and considerations to bear in mind when using these automatic PoS-tagging systems. For the latter, we used confusion matrices, so that we could check the types of errors made, and which were the most correctly assigned tags out of the total.
Gold standard
For the creation of our gold standard, we used a subset of the Longitudinal lEarner cOrpus iN Italian, Deutsch, English (LEONIDE) (Glaznieks et al., 2020), a collection of 2,512 texts from 163 trilingual pupils attending lower secondary school (scuola media) in South Tyrol. The corpus contains texts in three languages, namely English, German, and Italian, and in two text genres, meaning narrative in the form of a picture-inspired story and argumentative in the form of a simple opinion text. Over the span of three years, the pupils were asked to write one text for each of the three languages and each of the text genres per year. The portion of Italian data in the corpus amounts to 844 texts counting 93,378 tokens. For our gold standard, we randomly selected a sample of 10% of the total available Italian texts, i.e. 84 texts with 7,665 tokens. We pre-tokenized and pre-tagged the texts in the sample using Stanza with the combined PoS-tagging model in order to present our annotators with vertical files with one token per line and a PoS-tag to be eventually corrected. Once this step was completed, two language experts, native speakers of Italian, independently annotated the texts, correcting and adjusting the automatically pre-tagged version using the guidelines and documentation for the UD PoS tags and making use of the whole UD tagset. Their inter-annotator agreement in the independent tagging was relatively high, achieving a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.98. In order to investigate a possible effect given by the use of a pre-tagged corpus version by the annotators, we also tested tagging the texts from scratch, meaning without any pre-assigned labels in the tokenized texts. For this purpose, we selected a random sample of ten texts extracted from the original corpus. Once again, to compare the two tagged versions we calculated the Cohen's K value, which resulted in 0.95. Hence, we can conclude that the pre-tagged version had no particular effect on the annotators and did not significantly affect their annotation.
Despite the generally good agreement between the annotators, some difficulties emerged. These mainly concerned cases of German code-switching, particles, clitic pronouns and auxiliary verbs (see Discussion), and occasionally orthographical or overgeneralization errors (ex. Da grande facherò [X/VERB] il calciatore). For the gold standard these issues were unanimously resolved in accordance with the Italian UD guidelines.
Results
Table 1 displays the obtained results in terms of tagging models’ accuracy and Cohen’s K, this time comparing the gold standard and the taggers’ assigned tags, along with the accuracy scores reported in Stanza for the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task on UD v2.5 Treebanks evaluation.
The highest accuracy on our gold standard for learner data has been achieved by the combination of models chosen by Stanza per default. We would have expected better results from ISDT, considering the high accuracy values on the standard data used to train it, and PoSTWITA for non-standard texts. However, regardless of this, in respect to our gold standard, the best models for accuracy value and Cohen's K are TWITTIRÒ and ParTUT. These latter performed well despite the fact that their tagsets did not contain all the tags used in our gold standard. In fact, both TWITTIRÒ and ParTUT, as well as PoSTWITA, did not include the PART tag (contrary to the other treebanks such as VIT and ISDT) , and thus did not assign it to particles. However, our human annotators referred to this tag to mark the common use of pronominal, reflexive and adverbial particles, such as 'mi' and ‘si’ in the corpus (ex. Più lingue ci sono; Si deve studiare molto). Furthermore, the parTUT treebank also lacked the tag for interjections, INTJ, as opposed to other treebanks that did make use of this category. Nevertheless, the training data for TWITTIRÒ was the treebank provided in Stanza that was closest to our data in type. It was created using data from social networks, therefore far from the scientific, nonfictional, or journalistic canon. On the other hand, ParTUT had been designed using standard texts but in Italian, English, and French in parallel.
Discussion
The results show that the performance of the models was significantly influenced by the particular type of data in our gold standard corpus, which presented incorrect orthographical or morphological tokens, but also contained numerous foreign words and abnormally disposed parts-of-speech within the sentence.
In fact, when inspecting the tags incorrectly assigned by the different models with confusion matrices (see Figure 1, 2 and 3 below), we noticed that:
The foreign or misspelled words, which according to the UD rules had to be assigned the X tag, proved to be those with the highest number of errors. In fact, they were often confused with proper nouns, PROPNs, especially in the case of code-switching with the German language, where nouns are spelled with initial capital letters (ex. Dopo la scuola media voglio fare la Hotelfachschule [PROPN-X]). This was particularly evident with the ParTUT model that did not assign the X tag at all (see Figure 3);
The second most incorrectly tagged words were particles, PART, which are not included in the tagsets of all models although they could have been assigned to pronominal, reflexive and adverbial particles (see section 7). Instead, these words were usually assigned the PRON tag for pronouns (ex. Si [PRON-PART] deve parlare questa lingua);
The third most inaccurate group of tagged words was that of interjections, INTJ, which were also not included in all treebanks. These were often confused with particles or foreign words, PART or X (ex. Ehm [X-INTJ] ciao! fece Alessandra) as it is visible from Figure 2 in the case of the TWITTIRÒ model.
On the other hand, regarding discrepancies between the tags assigned by the human annotators, we found that:
The groups on which there was most disagreement between the two annotators concerned particles, PART, and auxiliary verbs, AUX (ex. Le strategie che funzionano peggio sono [AUX-VERB] studiare con il computer). Concerning the first, the models did not always include the PART tag in their employed tagsets. Auxiliary verbs, additionally, were also at times abnormally positioned within the sentence and were often automatically annotated incorrectly.
Foreign words were often not annotated according to the X tag, probably because the annotators also had knowledge of the German language and therefore tended to assign the corresponding tag in the other language (ex. Faccio la Landesberufschule [NOUN-X]).
We can therefore argue that there were errors common to both automatic models and annotators, although the reasons for the errors were evidently different.","Although all taggers managed to execute the task of automatically PoS-tagging pre-tokenized Italian non-standard language with an accuracy of at least 75% (with the combined model offered by Stanza showing the best performance with 95% accuracy and 0.94 Cohen’s K), there were differences in the performance shown by the individual models. The best performing two individual models were TWITTIRÒ (86%) and ParTUT (84%), while ISDT and PoSTWITA, that performed better in other evaluation tasks (Bosco et al. 2014, Cignarella et al. 2018) had a lower accuracy on our data. These results hint towards the fact that in order to automatically tag non-standard texts relating to language learners, the use of high-performance systems in the generic task is not sufficient, but the characteristics of the actual texts must also be taken into account.
Improvements could be made in the future regarding the adaptation of the models to the particular type of data used here. They could be, indeed, re-trained again in case a complete Treebank with Italian non-standard data becomes available. In addition, further attempts could be made to adapt or add the missing tags to the tagsets of all models so as not to have results biased by the lack of matching tags. Finally, as far as the annotators are concerned, they could be provided with the automatically pre-tokenized texts from the models, but in order to avoid pre-assigned tags influencing their annotation process, it would be preferable to omit these. Thus, human annotators would only get the taggers’ tokenized text versions, so that the same tokens will be available for everyone, while the assignment of PoS would be completely up to them.

In this paper, we propose the use of neural models 
for classifying English written exams into one of the CEFR competence levels. We employ pre-trained BERT models which provide efficient and rapid language processing thanks to attention-based mechanisms and the capacity of capturing long-range sequence features. In particular, we investigate on augmenting the original learner's text with corrections provided by an automatic tool or by human evaluators.
We consider different architectures where the texts and corrections are combined at an early stage, via concatenation before the BERT network, or as late fusion of the BERT embeddings. The proposed approach is evaluated on two public datasets: the EFCAMDAT and the CLC-FCE. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can predict the learner's competence level with very high accuracy, in particular when large labelled corpora are available. In addition, we observed that augmenting the input text with corrections provides further improvement.","Finding a system which objectively evaluates language learners' competences is a daunting task. Several aspects need to be considered, including 
both subjective factors, like age, native language, cognitive capacities of the learner, and learning-related factors, for example the amount and type of received linguistic input <cit.>. Indeed, language competences are not holistic, but concern different domains, so that considering the mere formal correctness of learners' language has been shown not to represent a proper assessment procedure <cit.>. Moreover, human evaluators, despite having to adhere to a pre-defined scale and guidelines, such as the CEFR <cit.>, have proved to be biased <cit.> and inaccurate <cit.>. For these reasons, new language testing methods and tools have been developed. Current state-of-the-art models, such as Transformers, allow to process numerous and complex linguistic data efficiently and rapidly, by means of attention-based mechanisms and deep neural networks that capture the relevant features for the targeted task. 
However, the creation and access to necessary language examination resources including annotations and metadata appear to date limited. In this paper, we propose using 
BERT-base models to automatically assign CEFR levels to language learners' exams. 

Our aim is examining the possibility of providing the system with previously generated corrections, either by humans or automatically with a language checker. Additionally, we want to analyse the impact of the amount of data on the accuracy of the model in the classification of written exams taken from the English First Cambridge Open Language Database (EFCAMDAT) <cit.> and the Cambridge Learner Corpus for the First Certificate in English (CLC-FCE) <cit.>. 
In this way, a significant turning point could be made both in improving the functioning of these automatic systems and in the future collection of data from other languages.","In this paper we presented an alternative approach for assessing the competences of English language learners using pre-trained BERT-base models. We structured a multi-class classification task to map the BERT embeddings of written exams from the EFCAMDAT and CLC-FCE corpora to different levels of the CEFR scale. Alongside the students' original texts and the provided manual corrections, we automatically generated corrected versions with LanguageTool. 
Thus, we conducted several experiments varying both the type and quantities of model input, as well as the model typologies. Our results proved that BERT-models remarkably succeed in classifying CEFR proficiency levels starting from original texts, especially with numerically significant data. Moreover, we observed that adding automatic and manual corrections can contribute to better results.",1,Language Models

The study is based on Twitter and collects data from 2006 to 2021. This allows us to set up both the quantitative and the qualitative study in a diachronic perspective on a time span of 15 years. We observe the distribution over time of a selection of feminine job titles (i.e., minister, mayor, rector, engineer and lawyer), compared to their masculine counterparts, distinguishing in particular the following cases: use of marked forms and use of semi-marked forms. The analysis shows that the trend of using feminine (i.e. marked) forms is generally growing through time. However, the unbalance between the actual number of women employed in some professions and the use of the correspondent feminine job title is wide.","The studies on how sexes are represented in language pertain to a transdisciplinary field of research where linguistic aspects intersect with psychological and social issues <cit.>. The various types of gender representations in language, along with their asymmetries, is a matter widely studied in linguistics <cit.> as well as in social psychology <cit.>. Some of these studies have also affected Italian <cit.>, where a renewed debate has spread in the recent past on the use of a more gender-inclusive language.[Elsewhere also defined as gender-fair, gender-neutral or non-sexist language <cit.>.][<https://www.valigiablu.it/linguaggio-inclusivo-dibattito/>.]

The presence of gender biases and stereotypes has drawn much attention even in the Natural Language Processing community.[See, for example, the Workshop Series on Gender Bias in NLP: <https://genderbiasnlp.talp.cat/>.] Research in this field mainly focuses on the study of a model's performance on data associated with a certain gender, or rather on the association between gender and certain concepts as found in language models <cit.>.

The present work, instead, aims at giving an exploratory account of the linguistic visibility of women in Italian language, with a focus in particular on job titles. For this purpose, we analyze the use of feminine forms used for job titles and professional roles in Twitter.

Studies on corpus-based discourse analysis have already focused on gender issues with respect to job titles in Italian. They either quantitatively evaluate the mostly used gendered forms in texts when referring to female referents <cit.>, or rather assess, by means of a survey among native speakers, the degree of acceptability of some feminine job titles <cit.>.
 

From a theoretical point of view, such works revolve (overtly or more indirectly) around the notion of markedness in language, that can be intended here as the “contrast between the unmarked (general, usual, non-salient) and the marked (special, emphatic)” (Clyne2009 cited in [p.50]Formato2019b).[In its most general sense, this term refers to an opposition between two - otherwise equal - linguistic elements, one of which is characterized by the presence of a mark and the other by its absence (e.g. voicing in voiced vs voiceless stops). However, the notion underwent a number of different interpretations and applications. For an in-depth analysis of the different perspectives with which this concept is treated, we refer to Moravcsik and Wirth Moravcsik1986 and Haspelmath Haspelmath2006.] In the present context, the “general, usual, non-salient” case is represented by masculine forms when used to express a generic reference. This means that grammatical masculine nouns are perceived and used as unmarked terms (for both men and women) based on the idea that they represent how the world is, opposing marked feminine terms which are seen as new, ungrammatical and `sounding bad'. 


While sharing with the studies mentioned above the same theoretical premise, the present work addresses the issue of women visibility in Italian language relying on user-generated data retrieved from Twitter: its peculiar nature as language data source, along with the opportunity it offers to extract and filter data based on specific keywords and time spans, makes this platform particularly useful for our purposes.

More precisely, we aimed at studying the distribution over time of a selection of feminine job titles, distinguishing in particular the following cases:



 * the use of marked forms, i.e. feminine forms referring to female professionals (e.g. la sindaca Raggi (`mayorfem Raggi'));

 * (for a restricted set of examples) the use of semi-marked forms <cit.>, i.e. the combination of masculine forms and feminine modifiers when referring to female professionals (e.g. la neo-ministro è incinta (‘thefem newmasc ministermasc is pregnant’)).

We thus provide some background knowledge on the main linguistic conventions of Italian language in the assignment of grammatical gender, also mentioning some of the well-known studies that have challenged such conventions over the years, towards a more inclusive use of feminine forms, especially for professions.
We then describe how data has been collected and filtered, and show the distribution of the selected job titles in both forms and across a 15-year time span.","In this paper, we reported the results of a corpus-based account of the linguistic visibility of women in Italian language, with a focus in particular on job titles, and using Twitter as data source. From a preliminary analysis of a selection of profession nouns, we found that some marked forms are increasingly being preferred in spite of semi-marked expressions. Besides extending and systematizing this analysis to other case studies, we also aim to observe the usage of such forms by Italian native speakers by tackling the issue as a stance detection task, so to assess how the users value a given marked form and, more in general, the adoption of more gender-inclusive linguistic habits. Furthermore, the messages leveraged on this topic might overlap with the task of misogyny detection and hate speech detection as well, broadening the horizons of three different NLP detection tasks. This design choice can also be motivated with regard to contextual stance detection <cit.>, to investigate how supporters/opponents of inclusive language strategies are segregated in different online social network communities.










Finally, due to its preliminary and exploratory nature, this work only reports the distribution of feminine and masculine forms, which are the two values for gender assignment taken in consideration for the analysis. 
We are well aware, however, that a comprehensive study of gender-inclusive language must necessarily cover all those linguistic forms that refer to the multiple and diverse identities in the gender spectrum.

With respect to this point, innovative forms have been proposed in the last years, in order to overcome the binary opposition, even in a grammatical gender language as Italian, such as the schwa (ə), the asterisk (*), the `at' sign (@), and other graphic solutions. This is another aspect that is worth exploring in a stance detection perspective, so to assess users' stance regarding the use of such linguistic innovations and their spread in everyday language.",21,Gender and Inclusive Language Studies

In particular, the debate is focused on trying to understand what kind of linguistic knowledge these models are able to induce from the raw data they are exposed to and to what extent this knowledge resembles human-like generalization patterns <cit.>. To pursue this investigation, it has become of pivotal importance the availability of challenging test sets, also called `diagnostic' or `stress' tests, built to probe the sensitivity of a model to specific language phenomena. 

So far, most of the efforts have been focused on assessing the syntactic abilities encoded by NLMs by exploiting human curated benchmarks, which are usually proposed in the form of minimal sentence pairs, i.e. minimally different sentences exemplifying a wide array of linguistic contrasts. A well-known one is BLiMP (Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs) <cit.> which contains pairs that contrast in syntactic acceptability and isolating fine-grained phenomena in specific domains of the English grammar, such as subject–verb agreement, island effects, ellipsis and negative polarity items. 

Differently from syntactic well-formedness, less explored is the sensitivity of these models to deeper linguistic dimensions involving semantics and discourse, such as textual cohesion, which are critical to language understanding. 
With this respect, one of the explicit devices that natural languages use to convey textual cohesion is represented by function words. As observed by Kim2019ProbingWD, although these words play a key role in compositional meaning as they introduce discourse referents or make explicit relations between them, they are still under-investigated in the literature on representation learning. To this end, the authors released a suite of nine challenge tasks for English aimed to test the NLMs' understanding of specific types of function word, e.g. coordinating conjunctions, quantifiers, definite articles. Reasoning about conjuncts in conjunctive sentences, saha2020conjnli, instead, introduced CONJNLI, a challenge stress-test for Natural Language Inference (NLI) over conjunctive sentences, where the premise differs from the hypothesis by conjuncts removed, added, or replaced. 
 
Taking inspiration from this work, in this paper we focus the attention on the role of textual connectives in the comprehension of a sentence and we introduce a new evaluation resource for Italian which, to our knowledge, is the first one for this language. The resource is articulated into two sections (acceptability assessment and cloze test), each one corresponding to a distinct task aimed at probing, in a different format, to what extent current NLMs are able to properly encode the role of connectives in a sentence. A peculiarity of the dataset is that it contains sentences that were extracted and minimally modified from existing corpora so as to test the comprehension of connectives in the real use of language.","In the context of studies devoted to assess the linguistic knowledge implicitly encoded by Neural Language Models, 

we introduced a new evaluation dataset for Italian designed to test the understanding of textual connectives in real-usage sentences. At first, we verified the significance of a set of selected connectives through a frequency analysis on already existing Italian gold corpora. Then, we manually selected only those sentences in which occur a genuine connective. 
Finally, we grouped the sentences into two different tasks, differing for the format used to elicit sentence comprehension in humans and current state-of-the-art NLMs: acceptability assessment and cloze test tasks. Human evaluation was provided for both the section, to verify the robustness of the dataset, which indeed was confirmed from the judgements collected.



Preliminary findings on NLMs behaviour on textual connectives showed that in several cases the models are capable of distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable sentences, thus suggesting their ability to encode sentence meaning within their internal mechanisms. 
However, it remains unclear to what extent these models rely on semantic acceptability features, since 
we observed cases in which they fail to recognize implausible meaning of perfectly grammatical sentences. 

We are currently increasing the dataset with the introduction of a new section designed in the form of the traditional Natural Language Inference task, for which the understanding of a given connective will be fundamental to infer the correct entailment relation between a premise and a hypothesis. We also believe that expanding the dataset to further connectives and including sentences representative of non standard italian language usage, i.e. social-media language, would be desirable to improve the robustness of the resource.

Lists are traditionally associated with spoken language and interaction (see, among many others, benveniste_1990, jefferson_list-construction_1990, selting_lists_2007). However, a broader approach has been proposed by masini_list_2018, who define ‘lists’ as syntagmatic concatenations of two or more units of the same type (potentially paradigmatically connected) that fill one and the same slot within the larger construction they are part of. This abstract definition embraces linguistic phenomena normally ascribed to different levels (morphology, syntax, discourse). ‘Lists’, or ‘listing patterns’ (LPs), thus encompass syntactic and discourse structures like coordination (e.g. The system allows gas, electricity and water meters to be read [British National Corpus]), reformulation (e.g. They now had lifts, or rather elevators [British National Corpus]) or repetition (e.g. Some people are very very very touchy [British National Corpus]), but also lexical and morphological phenomena like irreversible binomials (e.g. alive and kicking), (co)-compounding (e.g. Chuvash sĕt-śu lit. milk-butter ‘dairy products’, walchli_co-compounds_2005, p. 138) and full reduplication (e.g. Sundanese hayan-hayan lit. RED-want ‘want very much’, moravcsik_reduplicative_1978, p. 321). Although these phenomena have their own specific properties (displaying different degrees of complexity, cohesion and conventionalization), lumping them together may unveil interesting (cross-linguistic) structural and functional tendencies and help bridging the gap between discourse and grammar.

Attempting a typological study of LPs is not trivial and raises methodological issues. Data are available for some widely described LPs (e.g. coordination, reduplication, co-compounding), but other types of LPs are far from simple to find in descriptive grammars, which usually (and understandably) focus on long-established categories in phonetics, morphology and syntax (leaving often aside, e.g. syntax beyond the clause and discourse phenomena). The same applies to typological databases. Hence, doing typology in the ‘traditional’ way turns out to be hard, and a new integrated methodology for carving out the required data is needed <cit.>.



 §.§ A three-level methodology


The ListTyp database embodies this new methodology, which consists of three levels complementing each other (and running partially in parallel), encompassing both horizontal and vertical dimensions of investigation.

Firstly, a traditional large-scale examination of descriptive grammars is pivotal. For this first level (Level 1: horizontal), a ‘variety sample’ <cit.> represents the best option.[A variety sample does not represent a balanced picture of the world’s languages. Rather, it captures the broadest possible variation in order to maximize linguistic diversity.] This sample should be as large as possible (ideally 400-500 languages) to let the widest variety emerge. To this end, we have specifically created a sample of 424 languages (including isolate languages, pidgins/creoles and sign languages), following the Diversity Value technique with Ethnologue 2018[<https://www.ethnologue.com/>] genetic classification, which has proven to be the most reliable <cit.>. Descriptive grammars for these languages were selected according to criteria such as: (i) exhaustivity (in terms of contents); (ii) searchability (digital edition); (iii) presence of (possibly glossed) texts; (iv) recentness. In order to facilitate the (time-consuming) process of data gathering, we subsequently created, from this larger sample, a smaller sample of 223 languages (with its own internal cohesion, based on the same ‘variety’ principles), which is what we are currently using to populate the database (cf. mattiola_two_2020 for more details). Level 1 aims at achieving a preliminary survey of how languages work, but it merely scratches the surface: the general ‘imperfections’ of large-scale typology are made worse by the ‘untraditional category’ status of LPs, thus calling for other layers of investigation.

Secondly, a qualitative analysis of corpora and texts (e.g. texts at the end of descriptive grammars, free corpora, corpora made available by fieldworkers, etc.) is particularly useful to detect naturally occurring lists that are hard to be found in descriptive grammars used for Level 1. Needless to say, corpora of spoken language are especially useful for our current purposes. For this second level (Level 2: intermediate), the (convenience) sample is necessarily much smaller (ideally 20-30 languages). Level 2 maximizes the possibility to find discourse-level data (not necessarily described within the grammar) and allows to get over the problems of ‘traditional’ typology by verifying directly in a (albeit small) corpus data that the horizontal level did not bring out.

The third level, connected to the second, consists in a more quantitatively-oriented analysis of larger (possibly annotated) corpora of few (2-5) selected languages, which would provide enough data to draw some generalizations. Corpora might be either manually scrutinized (entirely or partially) or searched automatically through specific queries (depending on corpus annotation and size). The outputs of automatic searches are subsequently processed and checked manually. This level (Level 3: vertical) represents language-specific investigations that allow to study lists in much greater detail and to detect properties and constructions that more traditional methods might not be able to bring to light, as well as similarities between ‘distant’ languages.

The idea behind this three-level methodology is that combining data from different sources and extraction techniques not only enriches our database with new occurrences, but also contributes to unveil new patterns and to spot previously unexpected cross-linguistic correspondences. We believe that the very same methodology might be fruitfully applied to the typological investigation of other linguistic phenomena. At a more advanced stage of the project, we will also consider crowdsourcing as a collection technique, especially for underrepresented languages.",ListTyp is an ongoing project that welcomes collaborations for both data collection and analysis. We are currently processing data for completing Dataset A and enriching the other datasets. Updates will be published periodically. A full documentation will be available soon.,7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis
455_2021,2021,6,Cristiano Chesi,A Common Derivation for Parsing and Generation with Expectation-Based Minimalist Grammars (e-MGs),ENG,1,0,0,IUSS,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pavia,"Expectation-based Minimalist Grammars (e-MGs) are simplified versions of the (Conflated) Minimalist Grammars, (C)MGs, formalized by Stabler (Stabler 1997; Stabler 2011; Stabler 2013) and Phase-based Minimalist Grammars, PMGs (Chesi 2007; Chesi 2005; Stabler 2011). The crucial simplification consists of driving structure building only using lexically encoded categorial top-down expectations. The commitment on a top-down procedure (in e-MGs and PMGs, as opposed to (C)MGs, Chomsky, 1995; Stabler, 2011) allows us to define a core derivation that is the same in both parsing and generation (Momma & Phillips 2018).","Minimalism (Chomsky 1995; Chomsky 2001) is an elegant transformational grammatical framework that defines structural dependencies in phrasal (i.e. hierarchical) terms simply relying on one core structure building operation, Merge, that combines lexical items and the result of other Merge operations. (1).a is the representative result of two ordered Merge operations (i.e. Merge(γ, Merge(α, β)) both taking the items α, β and γ directly from the lexicon, while (1).b relies on the so called Internal Merge (Move): the re-Merge of an item that was already merged in the structure.
a. [γ [α, β]]Merge only
b. [β [γ [α, _β]]Merge + Move
As result, Move connects the item at the edge of the structure (β) with a trace (_β), a phonetically empty copy of the item that in a previous Merge operation combined with a hierarchically lower item (α in (1).b). In both (Conflated) Minimalist and Phase-based Minimalist Grammars ([C]MGs and PMGs respectively) Merge and Move are feature-driven operations, that is, a successful operation must be triggered by the relevant (categorial) features matching, and, once these features are used, they get deleted. Consequently, a feature pair is always responsible for each operation (unless specific features are left unerased after a successful operation, as in raising predicates and successive cyclic movement, Stabler 2011). One crucial difference between PMGs and MGs is that while MGs operate from-bottom-to-top, as indicated in (2), PMGs structure building operations apply top-down as schematized in (3):
Merge(α=X, Xβ) = [α [α=X Xβ]]MGs
Move(+Yα, [… β-Y …]) =
[α [β-Y [+Yα [… β-Y …]]]]
Merge(α=X, Xβ) = [α=X [Xβ]]PMGs
Move([α=S +Y[Y Z β]]) =
[α=S +Y[Y Z β] S[… (=Z [Z β]) …]]
Another relevant difference between the two approaches is related to the implementation of Move: MGs use the “+/-” feature distinction and the same deletion procedure after matching, while PMGs do not use “-” features and simply assume that both “+” and “=” select categorial features, which are deleted after Merge. In PMGs, “+” features force memory storage and hence the movement (downward) of the licensed item, until the relevant prominent category identifying the moved item (Z in (3)) is selected. If no proper selection is found, the sentence is ungrammatical. CMG as well dispenses the grammar with the +/- feature distinction and only relies on select features (=X), but it must assume that feature deletion can be procrastinated (again, for instance, in raising predicates). Despite the fact that, from a generative point of view, all these formalisms are equivalent and they all fall under the so called mildly-context sensitive domain (Stabler 2011), it is worth to appreciate the dynamics of structure building “on-line”, namely how the derivation unrolls, word by word. Taking the MGs lexicon (4), the expected constituents in (1) are built adding items to the left-edge of the structure at each Merge/Move application, as described in (5).
LexMG = {[Yα=X], [X -Zβ], [γ=Y +Z]}
i. Merge(Yα=X, X -Zβ) = [Yα [α=X X -Zβ]]
ii. Merge(γ=Y +Z, [Yα [α -Zβ]]) =
[γ=Y +Z [Yα [α -Zβ]]]
iii. Move ([γ+Z [α [α -Zβ]]]) =
[[-Zβ] γ+Z [γ [α [α _β]]]
An equivalent structure is obtained in PMGs as shown in (7). Notice a minimal difference in the lexicon (6): the absence of the “-” features.
LexPMG = { [Yα=X], [Z X β], [γ+Z =Y] }
i.Merge(Z Xβ, γ+Z =Y) = [[Z Xβ] γ+Z =Y]
Xβ → M
ii. Merge([[β] γ =Y], Yα =X) =
[[β] γ [(γ) =Y [Yα =X]]M = {Xβ}
iii. Move([[β] γ [(γ) [α =X]], Xβ) =
[[β] γ [(γ) [α=X [(α) X_β]]]] Xβ ← M
The result of the two derivations is (strongly) equivalent in hierarchical (and dependency) terms. The simplicity, in pre-theoretical terms, of the two descriptions is comparable: while PMGs must postulate the M storage to implement Move (as result of the missing selection of a categorial feature), MGs must postulate independent workspace to build nontrivial left-branching structures, for instance before merging a multi-word subject like “the boy” with its predicate (e.g., “runs”). Furthermore, both formalisms must restrict the behavior either of the M buffer operativity or the accessibility to the -f features to limits the Move operation (e.g., island constraints, Huang, 1982).
Top-down is better
There are at least three reasons to commit ourselves to the top-down orientation instead of remaining agnostic or relying on the mainstream Minimalist brick-over-brick (from-bottom-to-top) approach (Chesi 2007): First, the order in which the structure is built is grossly transparent with respect to the order in which the words are processed in real-life tasks, both in generation and in parsing in PMGs, but not in MGs.
Second, in PMGs, the simple processing order of multiple expectations is sufficient to distinguish between sequential (the last expectation of a given lexical item) and nested expectations (any other expectation): The first qualifies as the transparent branch of the tree (i.e. it is able to license pending items from the superordinate selecting item), while constituents licensed by nested expectations qualify as configurational islands (Bianchi & Chesi 2006; Chesi 2015). Moreover, successive cyclic movement is easily described in PMGs without relying on feature checking at any step or non-deterministic assumptions on features deletion (Chesi 2015) contrary to (C)MGs.
A third logical reason to prefer the top-down orientation over the bottom-up alternative is related to the unicity of the root node in tree graphs. As anticipated, the creation of complex (binary) branching structures poses a puzzle for (C)MGs: Independent workspaces must be postulated, namely [the boy] and [sings … ] phrases must be created before one can merge with the other:
[VP [DP the boy] [V sings [DP a song]]]
This is the case of “complex” subject or adjunct (i.e., non-projecting constituents which are simply composed by more than one lexical item) that must be the result of (at least) one independent Merge operation, before this can merge with the relevant predicate (e.g. [V sings …] in (8)). Processing these constituents represents a major difference between (bottom-up) MGs and (top-down) PMGs derivations. While MGs must decide where to start from (and both solutions are possible and forcefully logically independent from parsing or generation, which undeniably proceed “left-right”), PMGs take advantage of the “single root condition” (Partee, Meulen & Wall 1993: 439) and avoid this problem:
In every well-formed constituent structure tree, there is exactly one node that dominates every node.
As indicated in (3), the binary operation Merge simply produces a hierarchical dependency in which the dominating (asymmetrically C-commanding, in the sense of Kayne 1994) item is above the dominated (C-commanded) one. This is compatible with Stabler notation (10).a-b and plainly solves the ambiguity of the nature of the “label” of the constituent (Rizzi 2016). In this sense, PMGs (and the e-MGs discussed later) can adopt directly a more concise description, that is (10).c, more transparent with respect to the (Universal) Dependency approach (Nivre et al. 2017): Elements are “dependent” when they Merge.
a. MGsb. (C)MGsc. (P/e-)MGs
The higher node (possibly the root) is always the selecting item (a probe, in minimalist terms), and it is the first item to be processed. This does not necessarily imply that this item is linearized before the selected category (the goal, in minimalist terms): if the selecting node has multiple selection needs, it must remain to the right-edge of the structure to license, locally, the other(s) selection expectation(s). E.g., if [α=X =Y], [Xβ] and [Yγ], then:
[α=X =Y [Xβ] [(α=Y) [Y γ]]]
In this case, <α, β, γ> would be the default linearization, but it is easy to derive <β, α, γ> instead, assuming a simple parameterization on spell-out in case of multiple select features.
Here, I will argue that we can push further this intuition and only rely on (categorial) expectations, encoded in the lexical items, to guide the derivation. This leads to the so-called expectation-based Minimalist Grammars (e-MGs).
In the following sections, I will sketch a simple formalization for e-MGs (§2), and the core derivation algorithm (§3) that would be used both in Generation and Parsing tasks (§3.2).
The grammar
As (C/P)MGs, e-MGs include a specification of a lexicon (Lex) and a set of functions (F), the structure building operations. The lexicon, in turn, is a finite set composed by words each consisting of phonetic/orthographic information (Phon) and a combination of categorical features (Cat), expressing expect(ations), expected and agreement categories. In the end, an optional set of Parameters (P) (see Chesi 2021), inducing minimal modifications to the structure building operations F and, possibly, to the Cat set, under the fair assumption that F and Cat are universal. More precisely, any e-MG is a 5-tuple such that:
G = (Phon, Cat, Lex, F, P), where
Phon, a finite set of phonetic/orthographic features (i.e., orthographic forms representing words, e.g., “the”, “smiles”)
Cat, a finite set (morphosyntactic categories, that can be expect, expected or agreement features e.g., “D”, “V”… “gen(der)”, “num(ber)”, “pl(ural)” etc.)
Lex, a set of expressions built from Phon and Cat (the lexicon)
F, a set of partial functions from tuples of expressions to expressions (the structure building operations)
P, a finite set of minimal transformations of F and/or Cat (the parameters), producing F' and Cat', respectively.
Lexical items and categories
Each lexical item l in Lex, namely each word, is a 4-tuple defined as follows:
l = (Ph, Exp(ect), Exp(ect)ed, Agr(ee)),
Phon, from Phon in G (e.g., “the”)
Exp, a finite list of ordered features from Cat in G (the category/ies that the item expects will follow, e.g., =N)
Exped is a finite list of ordered features from Cat in G (the category/ies that should be licensed/expected, e.g., N)
Agr(ee) is a structured list of features from Cat in G (e.g., gen.fem, num.pl)
All Exp(ect), Exp(ect)ed and Agr(ee) features are then subsets of Cat in G. In Agr, for instance, a feminine gender specification (gen.fem) expresses a subset relation (i.e., “feminine” ⊆ “gender”).
For sake of simplicity, each l will be represented as [Expected(; Agree) Phon =/+Expect] as in (14):
[D the =N], [N; num.pl dogs], [T barks =D]
We refer to the most prominent (i.e., the first) Expected feature as the Label (L) of the item. E.g., the label L of “the” will be D, while the label of “barks” will be T. Similarly, let us call S (for select) the first Expect feature and R the remaining Expect(actions) (if any).
Structure Building operations
Given lx an arbitrary item such that lx = (Px, 
Lx/Expedx, Sx/Rx/Expx, Agrx) we can define Merge as follows:
Merge(l1(S1), l2(L2)) =

Merge is implemented as the usual binary function that is successful (it returns “1”) and creates the dependency (asymmetric C-command or inclusion, in set theoretic terms) (10).c, namely [l1 [l2]], if and only if the label of the subsequent item (l2) is exactly the one expected by the preceding item (l1), namely S1 = L2. This is probably both too strict in one sense (adjuncts are not properly selected) and too permissive in another (certain elements must agree to be merged). In the first case, I assume that [l1 [l2]] can be formed even if S1 is not =X but +X: while =X corresponds to functional selection (in compositional semantics terms Heim & Kratzer 1998), +X corresponds to an intersective compositional interpretation (e.g. adjuncts and restrictive relative clauses). As for the agreement constraint, I postulate an extra (possibly parametrized) condition on Merge, namely the sharing (inclusion) of the relevant Agr features associated to some specific categories.
The auxiliary functions necessary to implement Agreement are Agree and Unify and can be minimally defined as follows:
Agree(l1(L1), l2(L2)) =
Unify(1(agr1), 2(agr2)) =
Unification is simply expressed as an inclusion relation returning true and the most specific feature for any possible featural intersection between l1 and l2 Agr features. Notice that Agreement is a conditional, parametrized option, that is, it only involves specific categories (possibly specified in the parameter set P): if the L category belongs to the Agreement set (Agr) in P for the grammar G, unification will be attempted, otherwise agreement will be trivially successful. The fact that Agree should apply in conjunction with Merge is straightforward in the D-N domain: in most Romance languages, in which gender and number are shared between the determiner and the noun, we assume that D selects N (this happens also for intermediate functional specifications, according to the cartographic intuition, Cinque 2002). This is less evident in the Subject – Predicate case, in SV language, where the predicate should select (then precede) D. Since the subject is clearly processed (i.e. merged) before T, in canonical SV sentences, and it does not select T, a re-merge operation should be considered (e.g. case checking). This re-merge (inducing the locality of Agree, pace Chomsky 2001) is logically and empirically sound (movement and agreement can be related and parametrized, Alexiadou & Anagnostopoulou 1998). In this case, re-merge must be preceded by Move, an operation that stores in memory an item which is “not fully” expected (i.e. there are exped2 features remaining) by the previous Merge:
Move(l1(M1), l2(L2)) =

The definition of Move tells us that an item (l2) must be moved (pushed) into the memory buffer (M1) of the superordinate item (l1) if it still has expected features to be selected (L2 ≠ ∅). Notice that item moved in M1 is not an exact copy of l2: the used features (including Phon) will not be stored in memory. This definition produces the expected derivation if it applies right after Merge, that is, once the item l2 is properly (at least partially) selected; in this case, if l2 still has exp(ect)ed features to be licensed, it must hold in the memory buffer of the selecting item, waiting for a proper selection of what has become the new l2 label (i.e. L2). (Re-)Merge is then when agreement will be attempted (i.e. if Merge(l1, l2) in §3, should then be interpreted as if Merge(l1, l2) ∧ Agree(l1, l2) then… for specific parameterized categories). In the end, the top-down derivation in SV languages would unroll as follows: the subject (a DP) is first selected by a superordinate item (presuppositional subject position, situation topic, focus etc.) then it gets (partially) stored in the M buffer of the selecting item in virtue of the unselected D features, then re-merged as soon as a proper predicate, expressing the relevant T category requiring agreement (T should be included in the parameterized Agreement), is merged and properly selects a D argument (or it selects a V that later selects D). The content of the memory buffer is transmitted (inherited) through the last selected expectation, namely when the expecting and the expectee items successfully merge and the expecting item has no more expectations (R1 ≠ ∅).
If the expecting item has expectations, then the expected item constitutes a nested expansion, and the inheritance mechanism is blocked:
Inherit(l1(M1), l2(M2)) =

The M buffer of the last selected item that does not have other expectations (namely a right phrasal edge, i.e., S=∅) must be empty (i.e., M=∅). If not, the derivation fails (i.e., it stops) since a pending item remains unlicensed:
Success(lx(Sx, Mx)) =
Notice that the sequential item must be properly selected (=SX). If this is not the case, the inheritance would transmit the content of the memory buffer of the superordinate phase into the memory buffer of an adjunct or a restrictive relative clause, which clearly qualify as (right-branching) islands. Therefore, the “restrictive” (since feature driven) Merge definition in (15) seems correct and empirically more accurate than “free Merge” (Chomsky, Gallego & Ott 2019: 238).
The derivation algorithm
We can now define the full-fledged top-down derivation algorithm which is common both to generation and to parsing tasks (§3.2). Consider cn to be the current node, exp the list of pending expectations and mem the ordered list of items in memory. We initialize our procedure by picking up an arbitrary node from G.Lex as cn. Being cn the root node of our derivation(al tree) and w the array of words we want to produce/recognize, we can define the function Derive(cn, w) as follows:
while cn.exp & w
while cn.mem
foreach cn.mem[i] in cn.mem
if Merge(cn.exp[0], cn.mem[i])
Pop(cn.exp)
Pop(cn.mem)
else break
if Merge(cn.exp[0], w[0])
Pop(cn.exp)
if w[0].exped
Move(cn, w[0])
if w[0].exp
cn = w[0]
Inherit(exp[0], w[0])
Success(w[0])
Pop(w)
if not cn.exp
while !cn.exp & (cn != root)
cn = cn.father
else fail
Informally speaking, as long as we have lexical items to consume (w), we loop into the set of expectations of cn (cn.exp), first attempting to Merge items from (cn.)mem (if any), as in the active filler strategy (Frazier & Clifton 1989), then consuming words in the input (being w[0] the first available word). Remember that each word has exp(ect)ed features (the first being the label L), exp(ectations) and agr(eement) features. Cns have their own mem that can be inherited only by the last expected item, and, apart from the root node, a father. The derivation is then a depth-first, left-right (i.e., real-time) strategy to derive a structure given a grammar, a root node, and a sequence of lexical items to be integrated.
The complexity of lexical ambiguity
Ignoring Parameters, the derivation procedure in §3 should face lexical ambiguity: the same Phon in w[n] might be associated to multiple items l in Lex with different features; the default option is to initialize a new derivational tree for any ambiguous item in Lex. Given an ambiguity rate m in Lex, the derivation procedure would have an exponential order of complexity O(nm). We can mitigate this, either by selecting the element(s) bringing only coherent (i.e. expected) categories (a categorial priming strategy, Ziegler et al., 2019) or to use a statistical oracle, following Stabler (2013), to limit (or rank) the number of possible alternatives. It is however important to stress that lexical ambiguity is the major source of complexity in this derivation: syntactic ambiguity is greatly subsumed by the lexicon, being the source of structural differences related to the set of categorial expectations processed and to the order in which lexical items are introduce in the derivation. With the strict version of Merge defined in (15), no attachment ambiguity is allowed, since a matching selection must be readily satisfied as soon as the relevant configuration is created (but see Chesi & Brattico 2018). This is not the case if we would admit “free merge” instead of select/licensors-driven merge: in the first case, admitting that Merge(l1(S1), l2(L2)) is possible also if S1 ≠ L2, would produce a syntactic ambiguity which is (exponentially) proportional to the number of items merged in the structure. This is a crucial argument to prefer feature-driven Merge. Notice, moreover, that admitting that re-merge is also possible without proper licensors/selectors, would quickly lead to unbounded unstoppable recursion. This must be prevented if we want to avoid the halting problem. Therefore the licensors/selectors option seem to be a more logical, self-contained, solution.
Generation and Parsing
As far as Generation is concerned, the procedure described in §3 is integrally adopted and it is sufficient to produce the expected sentence with the associated, dependency-based, structural description. As long as the sequence of words w is concerned, once a root node is selected, it is easy to imagine a dynamic function, instead of the static ordered sequence w, that incrementally proposes items to be integrated, given the history of the derivation or, at least, the last expectation (a sort of structural priming, possibly enriched with semantic features if we add to the lexicon Sem(antic) specifications in addition to Cat and Phon ones).
Notice that the lexicon can include phonetically empty categories; this is not a problem for the generation procedure, that consumes input tokens one by one, and then considers a phonetically empty category on a par with phonetically realized ones, namely each item should be postulated as incoming token to be processed.
From this perspective, the Parsing procedure is minimally different since it must postulate a phonetically empty item, for instance in pro-drop languages, by deducting that the w sequence received in input is incomplete/incompatible with specific structural hypotheses. One proposal (Brattico & Chesi 2020) relies on inflectional morphology as an overt realization of unambiguous person and number features cliticized on the predicate, hence doubling the (null) subject. Otherwise, only after a relevant category is selected (with its agreement features) and unmatched by the current input, the empty item could be postulated. This non-determinism is exacerbated by the attachment/selection ambiguity: given [l1 =/+X [l2 =/+X]], for instance, an incoming item with X exp(ect)ed feature that should be merged with l2 first, according to the derivation algorithm provided in §3, could, in fact, be merged also with l1, assuming that l2 =X expectation can be satisfied with an empty item bearing X as exp(ect)ed. Similarly, an adjunct marked with Y exp(ect)ed category could be merged with both l1 and l2 in [l1 [l2]] in case of lexical ambiguity ([l1], [l1 +Y], [l2], [l2 +Y]). In this sense, the derivation procedure in §3 is insufficient as a full-fledged parsing strategy and must be integrated with disambiguation routines dealing with the possibilities just mentioned. It is however important to stress that these disambiguation strategies do not alter the general derivation procedure introduced here, which remains the lowest common denominator of Generation and Parsing in e-MGs.","The e-MGs formalization proposed here is a simple (parametrized) framework for comparing syntactic predictions directly with human parsing and generation performance evidence. This is possible since the core derivation algorithm is assumed to be the same in both tasks (token transparency, Miller & Chomsky 1963). While there is little to add to implement a full-fledged Generation procedure (see §3.2), as long as the Parsing perspective is concerned, the information asymmetry of this task with respect to Generation requires extra routines to be implemented, in addition to the basic derivation algorithm: lexical ambiguity must be resolved “on-line” and phonetically empty items must be postulated when needed. This creates an extra level of complexity which is however manageable under the same derivational perspective here presented: the core derivation is sufficiently specified to operate independently from parsing-specific disambiguation assumptions which operate monotonically with respect to Merge, Move and Agree. This is an ideal foothold for metrics that aim at comparing the predicted difficulty not only globally (De Santo, 2020; Graf et al., 2017) but also “on-line” that is, on a word by word basis (Chesi & Canal 2019; Chesi 2021).

Italian. The aim of this study is to investigate whether neural language models based on Transformer infer semantic-lexical aspects relevant to the interface with syntax and use this information for the completion of morphosyntactic tasks. The semantic properties considered are telicity (also in relation to identification) and l'agentività. Both are semantically determined and syntactically coded. The tasks were submitted to both the model and the speakers. The comparison between the two groups of data will allow us to determine whether these computational models capture significant aspects of human semantic competence.","The distributional hypothesis states that readings with similar linguistic contexts have a similar meaning (Wittgenstein, 1953; Harris, 1954; Firth, 1957).
The distributional models have been successfully employed in many tasks of Natural Language Processing, but what are the knowledge acquired during the training process remains an open question.
One of the approaches to understanding the nature of this language information is to evaluate their accuracy in psycholinguistic tasks. Some studies investigated syntactic properties and dependencies (Linzen et al., 2016; Ettinger, 2016; Wilcox et al., 2018; Futrell et al., 2019; Marvin and Linzen, 2018; Hu et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020), others focused on semantic and pragmatic aspects such as: similarity (Hill et al., 2015), categorization (Baroni e Lenci, 2010), analogy (Mikolov et al., 2013), denial (Marvin and Linzen, 2018; Jumelet and Hupkes, 2018), pragmatic reasoning, semantic roles and eventive knowledge (Ettinger, 2020).
Our work contributes to this line of research and adopts its psycholinguistic approach, but deviates from it in the properties investigated, proposing the analysis of telicity (in combination with identification) and of Agentivity.
The objective is to investigate whether the inference of these semantic-lexical properties favours the elaboration of some morphosyntactic tasks. In our analysis we chose to use a predictive distributional model that uses contextualized representations (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019): GilBERTO, an Italian distributional model inspired by the architecture of RoBERTA (Liu et al., 2019).
Aspects of the semantics of interface: optionality and agentivity
An important domain of lexical information concerns the event and its participants. If on the one hand the aspect is a notion of an eminently morphological and semantic nature, which concerns the modalities of carrying out the event (rather than its localization and the series of temporal relationships); verbal rationality, on the other hand, is not codified by flexive morphology. It is not enough to say that ""rationality"" is an inherent fact of the intrinsic meaning of a lecture, it is necessary to identify coherent classes of verbs, characterized by a homogeneous syntactic behavior within the language considered. There are several lexical aspects that can be encoded by a verbal class and that persist in the ational classification.
Vendler (1967) categorizes the ational classes on the basis of three fundamental properties (durability, dynamism and telicity) and identifies four main groups: the static verbs (states), activities, results (accomplishments) and transformative (achievements). Transformative verbs and resultant verbs are grouped in the tile category. The thelic events have the characteristic of being aimed at reaching a telos, that is a goal or an end.
Telicity
So far we have considered the tile class as the whole of the results and transformatives. In any case, it is necessary to specify that telicity can be understood as a continuum, a semantic axis that sees at the two extremes the prototypes of the category (inherently telic and inherently athelic) and at the center the elements that we will define configurational. Therefore, telicity is not a discreet property and it is not always possible to define it unequivocally (not being determined only by the lexical traits): being strongly dependent on the context (from the arguments of the verb and the transitivity, but also on the conjugation of the verbal aspect) and conveyed by the overall sense of the sentence. For example, ""drawing"" and ""singing"" are in themselves non-thetical verbal predicates: what makes them tell, in a given context, is the presence of a direct object that determines them, finalizing them to the attainment of a precise purpose.
In ""Gennaro"" he drew/sang all afternoon the verbal predicate is configured as athelic, but it becomes telic if you have ""Gennaro"" he drew the portrait of my grandmother"" or ""Gennaro"" he sang his favorite song ""Gennaro.""
From Bertinetto (1997), we learn that a test to distinguish the telic meaning of a verb from that of a non-thelic one is the addition of the adverbial ""in x tempo"" which is incompatible with the non-thelic predicates. The application of the adverbial ""for X tempo"" is, on the other hand, incompatible with verbal predicates or if compatible, neutralizes its telicity.
Telicity and detection
The identification of the subject or subject may affect the interpretation given to the event. The concept of identification unifies different properties of the topic and can also be considered a semantic interface property, because it acts both at a semantic and morphosyntactic level. The identification refers to the propensity of an entity to be conceived as an independent individual. We can consider the identification as the result of the following properties: individuals, animation, concreteness/astrattity, singular/plural, mass/count, referential/non-referenceal (Romagno, 2005). Conceiving identification as a continuum, meanings can be grouped according to equivalence classes that share the same detection properties and the detection classes can be sorted on the basis of their degree of detection. The degree of identification of an entity may be calculated on the basis of the derived average by the combination of the values of all the factors determining it. We will consider [+ identified] a human argument, own, animated, concrete, singular, numerable, referential and [- identified] an inanimate, common, abstract, plural, non numerable, non referential argument. Both from the semantic point of view and from the morphosintactic point of view, there is a reciprocal influence between identification and telicity. For example, in the sentence ""Eating bread"" the object is little identified; in the sentence ""Eating bread"" instead, the object is identified and represents the direct internal argument of the predicate. It follows that in the first case the interpretation assigned to the event is athelic and in the second case it is athelic.
Agentivity
According to Cruse (1971) the gentività is present in every sentence that refers to an action carried out by an entity that uses its energy to conduct the action. The definition of entities includes living beings, certain types of machines and natural events. From this it is possible to deduce that the active argument is prototypically the subject, being it the promoter of the action, and is always associated with a logical structure of activity; and that only verbs possessing in their logical structure a predicate of activity can have an active argument. In the logical structure of a predicate, the gentività is represented as DO (x, [do (x, ...]. For example, if you compare the verbs ""kill"" and ""murder"" (the first verb can accommodate inanimate subjects, while the second no) the logical structure is configured as: kill: [do (x, Ø)] CAUSE [BECOME dead (y)] Murder: DO (x, [do (x, Ø] CAUSE [BECOME dead (y)])) (Pustejovsky and Batiukova, 2019).
There are other verbs, however, that can take on an active interpretation. In fact, most of the time, the gentivity is determined by the way in which a verb is used within a sentence and is not an inerent lexical property of the verb. In these cases, the gentivity is not part of the lexical meaning of the verb and is not represented in its logical structure, rather it is determined by implications based on the animatedness of the actor and the lexical properties of the verb. Holisky (1987) argues that the active interpretation often arises from the intersection between the semantic properties within a sentence (the semantic properties of the NP actor and the predicate) and the general principles of conversation.
A very simple test to understand if the lexicalization is lexicalized in a verb involves the adverb ""unwittingly"" and consists in verifying whether its use creates a contradiction within the sentence. If the phrase becomes contradictory, then the verbal predicate lexicalizes the genentivity.
This is the case of: ""Gennaro murdered his neighbor ""unwarrantly, in which the contradiction is evident, so the predicate is active. It is also a property that acts in the interface between syntax and semantics, such as telicity.
Experiment
Our goal is, therefore, to investigate whether GilBERTo is able to infer the telicity (also in combination with the identification) and thegentity and to use this inference for the completion of morphosyntactic tasks. In addition, we want to determine whether the design of the model can be compared to that of the speakers in the same tasks.
Being both these semantic properties, encoded morphosyntactically, we can determine the correct elaboration by means of morphosyntactic tests. The selected answer will therefore be informative from the semantic point of view.
In order to ensure a direct comparison between the model and the speakers, both will be subjected to the same tasks.
Stimulations
The subjects and the model had to complete the cloze tests with the right morphosyntactic option.
We've come up with three tasks. The first task investigates telicity, the second the identification in relation to telicity and the third thegentity. Each task consists of sixty assertive phrases with verb conjugated to the next past.
In the first task on telicity the sentences had to be completed with the preposition ""in"" or ""per"" in the adverbial locuzioni ""in/per X tempo"" (in/per X tempo). Subjects are common names, employed by the third person, animated and sometimes used with the support of a possessive adjective. We have included verbs inherently telic (both resultative and transformative), verbs inherently athelic and configurational verbs (20 + 20 + 20). In the following sentences, extracted from the first task, we present examples with the thelic verb (1), athelic (2) and configuration (3):
The worker demolished the house in/for an hour
My sister slept in/for three hours
The boy has run in/for one hour
In the second task, which investigates telicity in relation to detection, we used the same cze test. However, we have structured a factorial design that divides sentences into four groups (of 15 sentences), according to the following scheme:
Group I: Subject [+ ind] and object [- ind]
Group II: Subject [+ ind] and subject [+ ind]
Group III: Subject [- ind] and subject [- ind]
Group IV: Subject [- ind] and subject [+ ind]
In each group we have included verbal predicates telici, athelici e configurationali (5+5+5). Let's quote a sentence for each of the four groups:
My brother drank fresh milk in/for five minutes
My brother drank a glass of milk in/for five minutes
III Furniture has accumulated dense dust in/for ten years
IV Furniture has accumulated a lot of dust in/for ten years
In the third task, which investigates thegentity, the sentences had to be completed with ""unwittingly"" or ""intentionally."" We have varied both the properties of the subject (including subjects with the prototypical role of actor, but also less prototypical subjects) and those of the object (including objects with the prototypical role of undergoer, but also less prototypical objects). We have included verbal predicates that have the property of the lexicalized agency in their semantic structure (i.e. inherently active), verbal predicates inherently inagentive and verbal predicates that can assume both values depending on the context (20 + 20 + 20). Also in this case we excluded the proper names and the subjects are all animated and the third person. The following example contains a verb of activity, inagentivo and configuration, respectively:
My brother has intentionally/unwittingly decided to choose
My brother has aged intentionally/unwittingly
My father cooked meat intentionally/unwittingly for a long time
In the first two tasks, the sentences submitted to the model, contained a masked word in the input and the model had to provide as output, in its place, the first five most likely options and their relative probabilities. In the third task instead, the model provides as output directly the full sentence with one of the options. The speakers, on the other hand, had to choose in each of the three tasks the preferred option between the two proposals.
Participants
65 native Italian-speaking volunteers had the task of completing the sentences by choosing the most appropriate option. Talkers were given instructions to complete the tasks at the beginning of the tasks. All data was collected through Google Forms.
Model
GilBERTo is a pre-trained Italian language model based on RoBERTa's architecture and CamemBERT's text-tokening approach. The model was trained with the technique of masking the subwords for 100k steps managing 71 GB of Italian text with 11.250.012.896 words (OSCAR: Open Super-large Crawled Almanach coRpus). It was considered a vocabulary of 32k BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) subwords, generated using SentencePiece tokenizer. In the first two tasks the Pytorch\fairseq Python library was used and in the third task the FitBERT library was used.
Results
The language theories state that verbs inherently telic should select x time, while verbs inherently athelic for x time. Configurational verbs select ""in"" or ""per"" depending on the the thelic interpretation that the subject wants to give to the sentence. The data of the first task confirm this scheme, as shown in Table 1, which shows the preferences of the model and the speakers.

Table 1: First task

As can be seen, the data of the verbs inherently telic and inherently athelic of both groups have very little dispersion: the interpretation is telic or athelic depending on the verbal predicate and there is no indecision between the proposed options. The configurational verbs, on the other hand, present, both in the model and in the speakers, a dispersion of the data wider and neither of the two options is preferable.
The data of the second task, collected in Table 2, present a more complex scenario.

Table 2: Second task

The data show that the model selects ""in"" only with verbs inherently telic (there is a greater gap between the two options in the first and third groups, where the object is [- identified]). The speakers, on the other hand, with verbs inherently telics select ""in"" in each of the groups, except in the first (subject [+ identified] and object [- identified]), where ""per"" is preferred in 55% of the cases. Contrary to the model in which, in the second and fourth groups (with objects [+ identified]), the probability of ""in"" is close to that of ""per"" is 100% in the speakers (-) is never selected.
With verbs inherently athelic, on the other hand, the speakers select 'in' when the object is [+ identified] and ""per"" when the object is [- identified] (in the second and fourth groups, then, respectively, in the ""80%"" and 75% of the cases). In the model, however, the option ""per"" is preferable in each of the four cases considered. Finally, with configurational verbs, the speakers show a preference for ""in"" in the second group (subject and object [+ identified]) and ""per"" in the remaining three. In particular, however, in the first group (subject [+ identified] and object [- identified]) ""per"" is successful in 100% of cases (confirming the data of verbs inherently telici, in which, in the first group, the speakers selected ""per"" at 55%); while, in the third and fourth groups (with subjects [- identified]), ""per"" obtains lower percentages, resulting in a lower gap between the two options. The model respects the schema of the speakers with the variation of the probability of ""per"" between the first group (with subject [+ identified] has a value of 90%) and third and fourth (with subject [-identified] has respectively 40% and 60%); but it does not confirm the schema of the speakers in the second group (it has 70%, while the speakers were never chosen).
The data of the third task are collected in Table 3.

Table 3: Third task

The results of the third task show that the model chooses the option ""unwittingly"" in more than 50% of the sentences, for each of the three groups of verbs, despite the variation of agentivity. The speakers, on the other hand, show consistency with the linguistic hypotheses.
Discussion
The purpose of the analysis was to test the elaboration of telicity (also in relation to the identification) and of the Agentivity, both in the speakers and in the model, and to investigate whether this elaboration determines the right morphosintactic completion.
The data show that the speakers operate in a manner consistent with the proposed hypothesis and linguistic theory. In fact, telicity determines the right morphosyntactic encoding. In addition, they show a clear influence of the identification on the tile interpretation. In the presence of verbs inherently telic, the speakers select ""in"" without being influenced by the minor identification of the subject. The only case in which the inherent telic value of the predicate undergoes a variation is with subject [+ identified] and object [- identified]. This same scheme is not found with subject [- identified] and object [- identified].
We know that the object is prototypically the role of patient and that therefore it is the one who in the case of a tile event undergoes the change of state, therefore [+ involved] and [+ identified]. On the other hand, the subject is prototypically the promoter of the action, then [- involved] and [- identified] of the object. In this case, we can assume that to guide the athelic interpretation (despite the inherent telicity of the predicate) is the non-prototypicality of the two arguments in the sentence. As proof, this does not occur in the sentences of the third group, in which there is no difference between involvement and identification of the subject and the object.
The behavioral data of verbs inherently athelic are also consistent with the hypothesis: the speakers give a thelic interpretation to the phrases in which the object is [+ identified] and athelic to those in which it is [- identified]. With the configurational verbs the thelic interpretation is possible only if both arguments are identified. The behavioral data also reflect the scalar nature of telicity: the configurational verbs are those that show a dispersion of the larger data.
This type of processing is also found in the model, where the configurational verbs show no net preference in favor of one of the two options, demonstrating that the model manages to infer the scale nature of the telicity. However, a difference emerges in the elaboration of the identification. On the one hand, the speakers are influenced by the identification in the tile interpretation; on the other hand, the model does not show the same sensitivity. This lack of elaboration of the identification is confirmed by the fact that with verbs inherently telic the model always prefers a thelic interpretation and with verbs inherently athelic interpretation. Therefore the agreement between model and speakers is determined by the properties of the predicate and not by the identification of subject and object.
The speakers also show consistency with the hypothesis and with the language theories. In cases where the gentivity is encoded in the eventive information of the verb is selected with a net preference the adverb associated with it. Conversely, it happens with inherently inagentive verbs; while configurational verbs show no preference for either of the two options. The model, on the contrary, completes the task without being influenced by the gentività. This result could be determined by the type of task or by the use of FitBERT, which for the first time is applied to a model based on the architecture of RoBERTa.
By generalizing, the model manages to use semantic properties conveyed by the predicate to determine the right morphosyntactic coding: it elaborates, therefore, the telicity in coherence with the linguistic theories, as a scalar property. However, it cannot be said that this elaboration takes place also for the semantic properties that are conveyed by the context of the whole sentence: the ""agentivity"" or the variation of the telicity due to the identification.","The difference of elaboration between model and speakers allows us to propose implications from the theoretical point of view. The first implication is that although these models show a certain sensitivity and adherence to the way in which speakers process language, they cannot be considered a cognitive model of language processing. However, this analysis allows us to hypothesize the encoding of these properties of lexical semantics in the vector information of the distributional models, making light on which are the encoded semantic information.
Surely there is a distributional influence in the way the speakers use the information, but it is also necessary to consider factors that depend on the extralinguistic context. In future works it makes sense to continue to investigate the elaboration of lexical semantics properties in distributional models, perhaps adopting other investigation techniques and comparing data extracted from different models. Future works will be able to investigate other properties of lexical semantics: e.g. split intransitivity.
Moreover, our work can be improved by including the study of the verbal aspect and the influence it has in the interpretation of the sentence (conjugation of the sentences not only to the perfect aspect, but also to the imperfective aspect). For example, it might be interesting to consider the case of Slavic languages that grammarize telicity through the opposition between perfective and imperfective aspects. Finally, these studies could be used to implement these distributional models, improving the way in which they convey semantic compositionality (at a frasal level).

457_2021,2021,8,"Chiara Barattieri di San Pietro, Marco Marelli, Carlo Reverberi",Moving from Human Ratings to Word Vectors to Classify People with Focal Dementias: Are We There Yet?,ENG,3,1,1,"Università di Milano Bicocca, Università di Verona",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,"Milan, Verona","Fine-grained variables based on semantic proximity of words can provide helpful diagnostic information when applied to the analysis of Verbal Fluency tasks. However, before leaving human-based ratings in favour of measures derived from distributional approaches, it is essential to assess the performance of the latter against that of the former. In this work, we analysed a Verbal Fluency task using measures of semantic proximity derived from Distributional Semantic Models of language, and we show how Machine Learning models based on them are less accurate in classifying patients with focal dementias than the same models built on human-based ratings. We discuss the possible interpretation of these results and the implications for the application of distributional semantics in clinical settings.","A Verbal Fluency (VF) task (Lezak et al., 2004) is a test routinely used in the neuropsychological practice that requires participants to produce as many words as possible belonging to a given semantic category (e.g., ""colours, ""animals"", etc.) within a time limit (typically 60 sec). It is commonly used to study lexical retrieval, and the subject's performance is standardly rated by the number of correct words produced for a given cue. However, to overcome the opacity of the overall score and help distinguish the different cognitive functions underpinning VF performance, additional measures of VF performance have been proposed. Among these, the number of consecutive words produced that share similar properties such as being a citrus fruit (this is called ""semantic cluster"" and its size is a clinically useful variable), and the total number of transitions between clusters (called ""number of switches"" – Troyer et al., 1997). Indeed, by characterising a semantic VF task (category ""fruits"") using the number of semantic categories produced, the average semantic proximity between words, the number of new words and out-of-category words, it has been possible to classify people with and without focal dementias, as well as across three different subtypes of dementias (Fronto-Temporal Dementia versus Primary Progressive Aphasia versus Semantic Dementia) with good accuracy (78% accuracy for patients vs healthy control classification, and 58.3% accuracy for classification across three pathological subcategories – Reverberi et al., 2014). One shortcoming of this model, however, is that those VP indexes are built upon human-based ratings of semantic proximity between pairs of words collected from a sample of healthy controls, making it hard to extend the same approach to words for which human judgments were not previously collected, i.e., other semantic categories.
Recent advances in Natural Language Processing techniques could help overcome this limitation. Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs) of language start from lexical co-occurrences extracted from large text corpora (Turney & Pantel, 2010), and applying different computational techniques, end up representing word meanings as numerical vectors in a multidimensional space. Here, terms that are semantically related are located close to each other. Such models can be used to simulate the structure of conceptual knowledge implied in the performance of semantic tasks such as a VF task. Indeed, DSMs have been successfully applied to different tasks of semantic relationships (Mandera et al., 2017), including the analysis of VF tasks to classify patients with Alzheimer's disease (Linz et al., 2017) and reaching remarkable accuracy (F1 = 0.77). However, despite the success, questions have been posed concerning what exactly distributional models can learn (Erk, 2016) and if such models are sufficiently rich in terms of encoded features (Lucy and Gauthier, 2017) to be applied to all sorts of semantic tasks/problems.
The present study aims to test if the analysis of a VF task based on DSM-derived measures would reproduce the results of an analysis based on human-derived measures. In particular, we decided to re-analyse the original data of a semantic VF task (category “fruit”) that Reverberi et al. collected on a cohort of participants with focal dementias and healthy controls (CTR). Focal dementias are neurodegenerative diseases that cause deterioration of cognitive function, including language. The original cohort included people with Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD), Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), and Semantic Dementia (SD). Each diagnostic group presents peculiar linguistic symptomatology, making these syndromes ideal candidates for a differential approach. The human-based indexes of VF (see Section 2 for details) were adapted to be computed on different DSMs (Landauer & Dumais, 1997; Mikolov et al., 2013). Specifically, we adopted two predict and one count model. All three semantic spaces were based on the itWac web-crawled corpus (Baroni et al., 2009). The two predict models (Word-Embeddings Italian Semantic Space 1 and 2 - ""WEISS1"" and ""WEISS2"") were obtained from Marelli (2017) and were chosen for both their practical accessibility (http://meshugga.ugent.be/snaut-italian) and their proven good performance in previous studies (Mancuso et al., 2020; Nadalini et al., 2018). WEISS1 is based on a CBOW model with 400 dimensions and a 9-word window; WEISS2 is based on a CBOW model with 200 dimensions and a 5-word window. Both models consider words with a minimum frequency of 100 in the original corpus. The count-model based on Latent Semantic Analysis (""LSA"") was created ad-hoc for this study following Günther and colleagues' (2015) procedure. Many psycholinguistic studies applying LSA in the English language used the TASA corpus (http://lsa.colorado.edu, including 12,190,931 tokens), which is a far smaller corpus than ItWac (about 1.9 billion tokens). To ensure comparability with this previous literature, we extracted a subset of the itWac corpus to match the TASA size. We selected an untagged set of 91,058 documents randomly extracted from itWAC, comprising the same set of words (N = 180,080) of the WEISS semantic spaces. The creation of a matrix of co-occurrences was carried out using the DISSECT toolkit (Dinu et al., 2013), and applying a Positive Pointwise Mutual Information weighting scheme (Niwa & Nitta, 1995), followed by dimensionality reduction by Singular Value Decomposition. We set the number of dimensions at 300 following the study of Landauer and Dumais (1997), which indicates good performance for dimensionalities ranging from 300 to 1,000.
Materials and Methods
The verbal production to a sematic VF (category ""fruits"") from the original cohort of 371 subjects (Table 1) was analysed. Overall datapoints were N = 3,642 words, with 133 unique words.

Table 1: Demographic information for all the subject groups.

Data were entered in an R pipeline, leveraging on two word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) semantic spaces (""WEISS1"" and ""WEISS2""), and an LSA space with identical vocabulary size (“LSA”). For each participant, the pipeline outputs three sets of semantic indexes computed according to five different thresholds (set to identify the occurrence of a semantic switch), corresponding to the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th quantiles of the distribution of semantic relatedness values (Table 2), computed considering the cosine proximity of all adjacent words produced by the whole study cohort.

Table 2: Cosine values adopted as thresholds for the three semantic spaces.

For each participant, we computed the following 9 indexes of VF:
Total number of valid words, produced in 1 minute, excluding repetitions. Differently from the original work, words not included in the vocabulary of the semantic space were obligatory excluded, but words not belonging to the category ""fruit"" were kept. Due to limitations of the semantic space's vocabulary, 53 words and compound expressions (8 from the patient group and 45 from the control group) out of the 3,642 (1.5%) were removed from the data;
Repetitions (""rep""): the total number of repeated words;
Total number of switches (""switch""): computational equivalent of the ""number of switches between subcategories"" in the original work. Semantic switches were identified based on measures of semantic relatedness obtained from three semantic spaces and according to five different thresholds (Table 2);
Total number of semantic clusters (""NC""): computational equivalent of the ""number of subcategories"" in the original work. Clusters were identified based on the occurrence of a semantic switch, i.e., when the mean value of cosine similarity of words within a cluster drops below the identified threshold (Table 2);
Mean size of clusters (""SC""): mean number of words within a semantic cluster; computational equivalent of the ""relative switching"" index in the original work;
Average semantic proximity (""prox""), the semantic distance between adjacent words. Unlike the original index, based on human-derived estimated of semantic proximity (Reverberi et al., 2006), we derived this index from the mean cosine between the vectorial representation of adjacent words in the participants' production.
In addition, to ascertain the replicability of original results with computational methodologies, the following indexes were adapted from the original work:
Mean familiarity (""fam""). As a computational equivalent of the original index, calculated according to familiarity scores collected from a sample of healthy controls (Reverberi et al., 2004), we computed the raw word frequency as derived from the corpus of reference (itWac), converted to lower case and excluding metadata;
Out-of-category words (""OOC"" ): number of words not pertaining to the 15 subcategories of ""fruit"" as identified in previous works by the same Authors (Reverberi et al., 2004; 2006). Given that the vectorial representation of words differs according to inflectional morphology, data were not normalised (singular to plural) but kept as originally produced;
Order Index (""OI"" ): computed following the formula proposed in Reverberi et al., 2006. In its simplified notation, the Order Index is equivalent to the difference between the theoretical maximum number of switches (total number of words minus 1) and the actual observed switches, divided by the range of theoretically possible switches (total number of words minus 1, minus total number of clusters minus 1). To avoid non-linearity problems, the participant production is represented in a three-dimensional space having number of words, number of switches, and number of subcategories as axes: the order index is then transformed using the arctangents of the resulting segments.
Statistical Analyses
All variables of interest were pre-processed to remove variance due to differences in age, level of education, and the total number of words. We ran a linear regression analysis with the relevant variable as the dependent factor and with age, education, and the total number of words as regressors (only considering healthy subjects to avoid any potential bias in the estimates due to brain damage). We then used the regression coefficients to compute the residuals for each variable and all subjects. Residuals were then used as predicting variables for the classification analysis. The average for each variable and each patient group was compared with the respective average in the control group through a two-sample t-test, Bonferroni corrected.
Classification Analysis
The R packages caret and e1071 (interfaces to the LIBSVM by Chang & Lin 2011) were used. The aim of the classification analysis was to determine: i) which variables, alone or in combination, would be able to classify a subject as being either a patient or control, and; ii) which variables, alone or in combination, would best classify a patient as being member of one of the three frontal dementia group (FTD, PPA, SD).
After removing variance due to differences in age and education, we performed a Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) analysis. The model kernels were set as linear, and relative weights were added to counterbalance the difference in group numerosity. In LOOCV, a data instance is left out, and a model is constructed on all other data instances in the training set. The model is tested against the data point left out, and the associated error is recorded. The process is then repeated for all data points, and the overall prediction error is calculated by taking the average of the recorded test error estimates. The LOOCV analysis was repeated for each combination of the 9 variables of interest, for each of the 3 semantic spaces, and each of the 5 thresholds, resulting in 7,665 models.
Results
We compared the performance of each group to that of healthy controls for each of the nine variables considered. All pathological groups significantly differed from the controls on at least one variable (Table 3). In the classification analysis, we investigated which variables (alone, or in all the possible combinations with other variables, i.e., 511 combinations) would best predict the membership of participants. We carried out two sets of analysis: i) healthy controls versus participants with focal dementias (PPA, FTD, and SD); and ii) participants with PPA versus participants with FTD versus participants with SD. The analysis was performed for each semantic space and for each preidentified threshold for a total number of 7,665 models.

Table 3: Variables that are significantly different between a given pathological group vis-à-vis healthy controls. Results Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparison are reported.

The best classification performances for patients versus healthy controls was found when we considered the variables ""total number of new words"" and ""Order Index"" at any threshold and with all semantic spaces. In these cases, the overall accuracy of the models was 61.2%, with sensitivity of 57.4% and specificity of 79.7% (Table 4).

The best classification performances for patients in their specific pathology group was found when we considered the variables ""out of category words"", ""average semantic proximity"", and ""size of clusters"" computed at the 3rd threshold (50th) of the WEISS2 space (Table 5). In this case, the overall max accuracy was 43.8%. Sensitivity and specificity for each pathology group were: PPA = 87.5% and 62.5%; FTD = 36.4% and 71%; SD = 13.33% and 81.6%, respectively.

Discussion
In this work, we replaced human-based measures of semantic proximity with DSM-derived measures of semantic proximity to compute a set of indexes of VF that was found to be able to classify with good accuracy people with and without focal dementias based on their verbal production to a semantic VF task (category ""fruits"", which was originally adopted to limit the set of possible items as compared to broader categories such as “animals”). The objective of the study was to assess the accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) models based on DSM measures of semantic information, in view of their possible extension to words and semantic categories for whom the measure of semantic proximity is not available. Despite being above chance in both cases, ML models based on DSM-derived measures of semantic proximity showed lower accuracy compared to models built on human-based ratings. This was true both for the classification of patients versus controls (61.2% and 84%, respectively), as well as for the subclassification of diagnosis (43.8% and 58%, respectively).
The observed differences might be due to the functional adaptations needed to transpose the original VF indexes to DSM-derived measures. For example, the computational equivalent of the ""familiarity"" index, calculated according to familiarity scores collected from the sample of healthy controls, was approximated via the raw word frequency as derived from the corpus of reference. Moreover, given that the vectorial representation of words differs according to inflectional morphology, data were not normalised (singular to plural) but kept as originally produced, unlike the original work. Hence, it might be possible that these operations introduced some distortions that could explain the differences observed compared to the original study.
In terms of parameter setting, it is worth noting that our choices might have affect the overall performance of the adopted models, possibly reducing their ability to avoid noise and biases. For example, according to Tripodi (2017), hyperparameter setting for Italian has specific requirements in terms of vector size, negative sampling, vocabulary threshold cutting, to maximize performance in an analogy task (although to what extent such recommendation can be extended to VF is an empirical question that remains to be addressed). Also, the choice of a CBOW model, instead of “more predictive” algorithms such as Skipgram and Mask might have reduced the ability of the model to mimic the human ratings of word associations.
However, a different explanation might be related to the type of information encoded into the human proximity ratings. Given its evolutionary relevance, the neural substrate underpinning the notion of ""fruits"" might encode a rich multidimensional semantic characterisation (including sensory information such as taste, smell, sight, touch). As such, the representation of this semantic category might not be simply derivable by the lexical distribution of its items in a corpus. Differently, other semantic categories might leverage on less perceptual and more encyclopaedic semantic knowledge, such as, for example, the category ""animals"", another semantic cue widely used for the assessment of VF. Indeed, while people do generally have first-hand, real-life experience of ""fruits"", knowledge about ""animals"" may be more commonly derived from indirect exposure to encyclopaedic information (i.e., the media). In other words, when we think about a cherry, we may not only recall the meaning of the lemma as compared to, for example, an apple, but at the same time, we might also recall the sensory information attached to the drupe (round, red, juicy, etc.). Conversely, apart from common pets, it is unlikely that participants have first-hand experience about most of the items commonly included ""animals"" category (e.g., ""lion"", “whale”, etc.).
This means that distributional models might be not the best-suited tool to resolve semantic problems when the semantic task under investigation makes use of a subset of words pertaining to a semantic category perceptually rich (such as that of “fruits”).","The past decades have witnessed an increasing interest towards the application of NLP techniques to answer, or support the resolution of, different clinical problems, from patients’ classifications to disease monitoring, and from differential diagnosis to prediction of treatment response (see de Boer et al., 2018 for a comprehensive review). All these applications implicitly rely on the assumption that these techniques are agnostic/transparent to the semantic task under investigation and, given the good results obtained, that they are equipped with sufficiently rich semantic information to solve any kind of task based on linguistic data. Our findings challenge this idea and align with previous works pointing to a lack of basic features of perceptual meaning in DSM (Lucy and Gauthier, 2017).
Implications for the application of DSM-derived measures to clinical work and research indicate that the choice of the verbal task and the associated DSM can affect the results. For this reason, we plan to assess the classification accuracy of ML models built both on human ratings and DSM-derived measures of semantic proximity for other categorical VF tasks, as well as adopting word vectors derived from lemmatised corpora.
Before moving to more recent language models such as the last generation of deep neural language models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), consideration should be given to the trade-off between computational and data resources needed to train them (Bender et al., 2021) on one hand, and what kind of added value they can give compared to traditional “static” embeddings (Lenci et al., 2021) on the other. Further research might address the limits of current DSM models by enriching the information encoded, integrating experiential and distributional data to induce reliable semantic representations (Andrews et al., 2009). Additional sources of multimodal information (e.g., Lynnott et al., 2020) including visual and audio information, might help overcome these current limitations (Chen et al., 2021).

However, state-of-the-art knowledge models rarely adopt such a comprehensive 
and cross-lingual approach to semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel automatable methodology for knowledge modeling 
based on a multilingual word alignment mechanism that enhances the encoding of unbiased and naturally disambiguated lexical knowledge.

Results from a simple implementation of the proposal show relevant outcomes that are not found in other resources.","Lexical resources constitute a key instrument for many NLP tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation and Machine TranslationCopyright ©️2021 for this paper by its authors. Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).. However, their potential may vary widely depending on the nature of the lexical-semantic knowledge they encode, as well as on how the linguistic data are stored and linked within the network <cit.>. 
The resources that are presently available, such as WordNet <cit.>, typically encode lexical-semantic knowledge mainly in terms of word senses, defined by textual (i.e. dictionary) definitions, and lexical entries are linked and put in context through lexical-semantic relations. These relations, being only of a paradigmatic nature, are characterized by a sharing of the same defining properties between the words and a requirement that the words be of the same syntactic class <cit.>. 

Typically related words are therefore not represented due to the absence of syntagmatic links. 
Additionally, word senses suffer from a lack of explicit common-sense knowledge and context-dependent information. Finally, the well-known fine granularity of word senses in WordNet <cit.> is due to the lack of a meaning encoding system capable of representing concepts in a flexible way. 
Other kinds of resources such as FrameNet <cit.> and ConceptNet <cit.> present the same issue, while returning different types and degrees of structural semantic information and disambiguation capabilities. 


In this contribution, we provide a novel methodology for the retrieval and representation of unbiased and naturally disambiguated lexical information 
that relies on a multilingual word alignment mechanism. In particular, we exploit textual resources in different languages[In this work, we start with the combination of three languages: English, German and Italian.] in order to acquire and align varied lexical-semantic material of the form <target-concept, {related words}^k> that are common and shared by all the k languages involved. As we demonstrate through a simple implementation, our method allows to create new lexical-semantic relations between words that are not always available in other resources, as well as to perform an automatic word sense disambiguation process. This system therefore enhances the encoding of prototypical semantic information of concepts that is also likely to be free from strong cultural-linguistic and lexicographic biases.


The benefits provided by our novel multilingual word alignment mechanism are thus fourfold: (i) a linguistic and lexicographic de-biasing of lexical knowledge; (ii) naturally-disambiguated aligned lexical entries; (iii) the discovery of novel lexical-semantic relations; and (iv) the representation of prototypical semantic information of concepts in different languages.","In this paper we proposed an original methodology for acquiring and encoding lexical knowledge through a novel yet simple mechanism of multilingual alignment. 

The aim was to represent varied, disambiguated, and language-unbounded lexical knowledge by minimizing strong linguistic and lexicographic biases. 






A simple implementation and experimentation on 456 concepts carried to unveil around 76K aligned lexical-semantic features, of which more than 80% resulted new when compared with a current state-of-the-art resource such as BabelNet. 
Future directions include the use of more languages and large-scale runs over thousands of main concepts <cit.>.

Thanks to this package, we were able to build a reliable recogniser for adults' speech by fine tuning the English model provided by NVIDIA and rescoring it with powerful neural language models, obtaining very good performances.
The lack of a standard, reliable and publicy available baseline for Italian motivated this work.","TheCopyright ©2021 for this paper by its authors. Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). advent of the “Deep Learning Revolution” introduced astonishing changes also in the field of speech processing allowing for the development of brand new tools and devices able to recognise and synthesise speech exhibiting performances never seen before. It is sufficient to think to the new virtual assistants that populates our houses and mobile phones for getting an immediate idea about the improvements in this research field. 

Most big IT companies developed, in the past 3/4 years, solutions well integrated with various devices that include high performance tools for speech processing. However, these solutions very often are not released freely, sometimes they require registrations and fees and, in the best situations, codes are free, but the models for a specific language are not available. A notable exception regards NVIDIA NeMo[Other exceptions providing also multilingual models including Italian are Facebook Wav2Vec and SpeechBrain.], a conversational AI toolkit built for researchers working on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Text-To-Speech synthesis (TTS). The primary objective of NeMo is to help researchers from industry and academia to reuse prior work, namely code and pretrained models for various languages, and make it easier to create new conversational AI models, maybe adapting tools and models to specific languages or particular domains.

This paper reports an attempt to build a high performance Large Vocabulary ASR system for Italian adults' speech by exploiting all the features available in NeMo and most of the largest Italian spoken corpora available to the community. 

Section <ref> describes the various speech datasets used for developing the model, followed by Section <ref> that describes the state of the art; in Section <ref> we will describe the NeMo ASR model used in the experiments and Section <ref> will discuss the experiments and the obtained results. Section <ref> draws some provisional conclusions about our work.","This paper presented work in progress for the construction of a reliable and performing ASR system for Italian adults' speech.
Thanks to the NVIDIA NeMo package, we were able to produce a very strong baseline reaching a WER = 9.67% over the MCV7 test set.

This is only the beginning of our work, as any change in the kind of speech used to train the system could degrade the whole performance, but, having used a collection of four different datasets containing thousands of different speakers and speech utterances for setting up such ASR system, we believe that the result should be robust enough. Unfortunately, the lack of a standardised benchmark for Italian does not allow for a quantitative and objective evaluation of this statement.

End-to-end character ASR model, and its improvement on WER, is only part of the game: the work on decoding and rescoring procedures produced much more improvements. Thus, the most important “take home lesson” is certainly to focus on the development of high performance LM specifically tuned for ASR.

All the models presented in this paper as well as the scripts and additional codes for using NeMo and generating the results will be made available[<https://github.com/ftamburin/ItaNeMoASR>].",13,Multimodal

In Italy, cloze tests are administered to incoming university students to ascertain their starting level. The goal of a cloze test is to determine several tokens that have been pre-deleted from a text; this is largely equivalent to the well-known NLP task of missing token prediction. In this paper, we show that cloze tests can be solved reasonably well with various Transformer-based pre-trained language models, whose performance often compares favorably to the one of incoming Italian university students.","A cloze test is a reading comprehension assessment where participants are presented with a text in which selected tokens have been replaced with blanks. The goal is for the participant to choose tokens (often from a list) and use them to replace the blanks based on the overall context. Typically, one every 5-10 tokens is replaced with a blank. 

Cloze tests are one of the most common linguistic tests in use for formative and summative purposes, along with written responses, multiple-choice tests, matching tests, ordering tests, summarizing tests etc. <cit.>. Cloze tests were originally introduced in the United States in the 1950s to measure the readability of texts <cit.> and involved the random and not pre-determined deletion of words that appeared at pre-defined intervals. This method was too general for didactic and evaluation purposes, but it was quickly adapted and became very widespread as a teaching and testing technique <cit.>. In education, cloze tests have become more targeted: words are deleted according to various criteria, depending on the specific testing goals. In general, cloze tests are designed to evaluate one of the following:



 * field-specific knowledge acquisition, by asking to insert appropriate words about a topic or a discipline; 

 * text comprehension, by asking for information that can be inferred from the text (with no prior domain knowledge);

 * linguistic aspects, typically with respect to L1, L2 and FL (foreign language) acquisition at different levels (i. e. vocabulary, specific parts of speech etc.). 


If carefully designed, cloze tests can be a very effective tool at all educational levels; on the other hand, cloze tests may also show some limits and issues in assessing linguistic competence <cit.>, as they necessarily offer a partial and contextual view. However, the long tradition of study and use in the fields of educational linguistics and linguistic makes it very interesting to compare human and automatic performances in dealing with cloze tests.","While these results are based on as few as eleven cloze tests (and only two unrestricted ones), the key takeaway is that existing pre-trained Italian language models with no task-specific fine-tuning can successfully tackle (and pass) relatively sophisticated tests designed for Italian students who have successfully completed their high school education. These results, though preliminary in nature, suggest various research questions, which could be answered based on a larger set of cloze tests. Such questions include whether there exists a pattern to the incorrect replacements made by the models, how the models fare with different parts of speech and with function words as opposed to content words, and how much their performance would improve with task-specific fine-tuning.

output generation has to be performed on partial, incremental speech input.

In recent years, SimulST has become popular due to the spread of multilingual application scenarios, like international live conferences and streaming lectures, in which on-the-fly speech translation 

can facilitate users' access to audio-visual content. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of the SimulST systems developed so far,

discussing 

their strengths and weaknesses.
We then concentrate on the evaluation framework required to 

properly assess systems' effectiveness.

To this end, we raise the need for a broader performance analysis, also including the user experience standpoint. We argue that SimulST systems, indeed, 

should
be evaluated not only in terms of quality/latency measures, but also via task-oriented metrics accounting, for instance, for the visualization strategy adopted.
In light of this, we 

highlight which are the goals achieved by the 

community

and what is still missing.Copyright 2021 for this paper by its authors. Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).","Simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) is the task in which the translation of a source language speech 

has to be performed on partial, incremental input.
This is

a key feature to achieve low latency in scenarios like streaming conferences and lectures, where the text has to be displayed following as much as possible the pace of the speech.
SimulST is indeed a 

complex task in which the difficulties of performing speech recognition from partial inputs are exacerbated by the problem to project meaning across languages.
Despite the increasing demand for such a system, the problem is still far from being solved.

















 






So far, research efforts mainly focused on the quality/latency trade-off, i.e. producing high quality outputs in the shortest possible time, balancing the need for a good translation with the necessity of a rapid text generation. 

Previous
studies, however, disregard how the translation is displayed

and, consequently, how it is actually 
perceived by the end users. 

After a concise survey of the state of the art in the field, in this paper we posit 



that, from the users' experience standpoint, output visualization is at least as important as having a good translation in a short time.
This raises the need for a broader, task-oriented and human-centered analysis of 

SimulST systems' performance, also accounting for 

this third crucial factor.","SimulST systems have become increasingly popular in recent years and many efforts have been 

made
to build robust and efficient models.
Despite the difficulties introduced by the online framework, these models have rapidly improved, achieving comparable results to the offline 

systems.
However, many research directions have not been explored enough (e.g., the adoption of dynamic or fixed segmentation, the offline or the online training).

First among all, the visualization strategy that is adopted to display the output of the simultaneous systems is an important and largely under-analyzed aspect of the simultaneous experience. 

We posit that the presence of application-oriented metrics (e.g., reading speed), which are strongly related to the visualization and, as an ultimate goal, to the user experience, is the factor that misses in the actual evaluation environment.

Indeed, this

paper points out that BLEU and Average Lagging are not the only metrics that matter to effectively evaluate a SimulST model, even if they are fundamental to judge a correct and real-timed translation. We hope that this will inspire the community to work on this critical aspect in the future.",13,Multimodal

We also present a preliminary evaluation of parsing performance, comparing a model trained on existing Italian treebanks with the model obtained by adding MarkIT to the training set.","In recent years, the goal to develop robust frameworks for consistent annotation of syntactic dependencies across different human languages has led to the creation of Universal Dependencies (UD), an initiative covering nearly 200 treebanks in more than 100 languages. Since UD treebanks are then used to train syntactic parsers, it is important that they account for as many phenomena as possible that can be found in a language, and not only for canonical expressions typically written in news. The purpose to encompass the variety of use in the Italian language has been pursued by including different genres in the VIT treebank <cit.> and in ParTUT <cit.> and more recently by including syntactically annotated tweets <cit.> in the UD framework. Overall, seven treebanks are listed under the UD initiative for Italian. In this work, we contribute to this effort by presenting a novel treebank including syntactically annotated marked constructions, which we call MarkIT (MARKed structures Italian Treebank).

The Liber Abbaci (13th century) is a milestone in the history of mathematics and accounting. Due to the late stage of Latin, its features and its very specialized content, it also represents a unique resource for scholars working on Latin corpora. In this paper we present the annotation and linking work carried out in the frame of the project Fibonacci 1202-2021. A gold-standard lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging allow us to elaborate some first observations on the linguistic and historical features of the text, and to link the text to the Lila Knowledge Base, that has as its goal to make distributed linguistic resources for Latin interoperable by following the principles of the Linked Data paradigm. Starting from this specific case, we discuss the importance of annotating and linking scientific and technical texts, in order to (a) compare and search them together with other (non-technical) Latin texts (b) train, apply and evaluate nlp resources on a non-standard variety of Latin. The paper also describes the fruitful interaction and coordination between nlp experts and traditional Latin scholars on a project requiring a large range of expertise.[Copyright ©2021 for this paper by its authors. Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).]","Latin texts have a wide diachronic and diatopic extension that corresponds to a similarly large diversity of the textual genres they represent. Besides literary ones, a huge amount of Latin texts of several different genres can be found spread all over Europe and beyond. An important textual genre is represented by scientific treaties, which in many cases are interesting not only for their contents, but also because of the technical terminology they feature.


This is precisely the case for the Liber Abbaci `the book of the abacus' by Leonardo of Pisa (also known as Fibonacci). Written in the very first years of the 1200s, it is a book on arithmetic promoting a style of calculation based on Arabic numerals without aid of an abacus. Fibonacci 1202-2021 is a project financed by the Tuscany Region and involving the University of Pisa and the Galilei Museum in Florence, following the publication of a critical edition of the Liber Abbaci by Enrico Giusti <cit.>. The goal of the project is to produce an enhanced digital edition of this work by leveraging advanced publishing tools and investigating the use of computational linguistics techniques in order to uncover the wealth of linguistic, scientific and historical information contained in the book.

Besides its scientific interest, the Liber Abbaci features a very peculiar lexicon, not often represented in the currently available (linguistically annotated) corpora for Latin. In order to fill this gap, in the context of the project Fibonacci 1202-2021 we have started performing the linguistic annotation of the Liber Abbaci, beginning from part-of-speech (PoS) tagging and lemmatization of a specific chapter of the book, chosen for its linguistic and historical interest. The dataset is freely available online[ <http://dialogo.di.unipi.it/LiberAbbaci>].

This paper describes the process of annotation of the Liber Abbaci and two applications of its results, namely (a) the evaluation of a number of trained models for PoS tagging and lemmatization for Latin in out-of-domain fashion and (b) the interlinking of the annotated chapter with other linguistic resources for Latin through the Lila Knowledge Base (KB)[<https://lila-erc.eu>].","This paper describes the annotation of one chapter of the Liber Abbaci by Fibonacci, and reports on the linguistic peculiarities of this text and the ensuing challenges. 

The results of existing UDPipe models in lemmatization and tagging show low accuracy and f1 scores when compared to the state of the art for these tasks in the recent EvaLatin 2020 evaluation campaign. This, on the one hand, can be attributed to the characteristics of the genre of Fibonacci's texts, which are representative of scientific Medieval Latin texts, and on the other hand can be explained with the different choices in annotation style of Latin treebanks released under the ud project. 
Substantial improvements can be expected with models trained on new releases of Latin treebanks which have already undertaken the effort of resolving annotation discrepancies and of making the annotation style across treebanks more homogeneous. Further improvements will however require new annotated chapters and experiments in domain adaptation, which are scheduled as future work.",5,Latin Resources

In this paper we present a set of annotated data and the results of a number of unsupervised experiments for the analysis of sentiment in Latin poetry. More specifically, we describe a small gold standard made of eight poems by Horace, in which each sentence is labeled manually for the sentiment using a four-value classification (positive, negative, neutral and mixed). Then, we report on how this gold standard has been used to evaluate two automatic approaches for sentiment classification: one is lexicon-based and the other adopts a zero-shot transfer approach.[Copyright ©2021 for this paper by its authors.

Giovanni Moretti developed the zero-shot classification script.]","The task of automatically classifying a (piece of) text according to the sentiment conveyed by it, known as Sentiment Analysis (SA), is usually performed for purposes such as monitoring contents of social media or evaluating customer experience, by analysing texts like tweets, comments, and micro-blogs.

A still under-investigated yet promising research area where developing and applying SA resources and techniques is the study of literary texts written in historical and, particularly, Classical languages (e.g. Ancient Greek and Latin).
Actually, investigating the lexical properties of Classical literary texts is a century-long common practice. However, such investigation can nowadays (1) lead to replicable results, (2) benefit from techniques developed for analysing the sentiment conveyed by any type of text and (3) be performed with freely available lexical and textual resources.
As for the latter, the research area dedicated to building and using linguistic resources for Classical languages has seen a substantial growth during the last two decades <cit.>. For what concerns SA, we recently built a polarity lexicon for Latin nouns and adjectives, called LatinAffectus. The current version of the lexicon includes 4,125 Latin lemmas with their corresponding prior polarity value <cit.>.
LatinAffectus was developed in the context of the LiLa: Linking Latin project (2018-2023)[<https://lila-erc.eu>] <cit.> which aims at building a Knowledge Base of linguistic resources for Latin based on the Linked Data paradigm, i.e. a collection of several data sets described using the same vocabulary of knowledge description and linked together. LatinAffectus is connected to the Knowledge Base, thus making it interoperable with the other linguistic resources linked so far to LiLa <cit.>.

In this paper we describe the use of LatinAffectus to perform SA of the Odes (Carmina) by Horace (65 - 8 BCE). Written between 35 and 13 BCE, the Odes are a collection of lyric poems in four books. Following the models of Greek lyrical poets like Alcaeus, Sappho, and Pindar, the Odes cover a wide range of topics related to the individual and social life in Rome during the age of Augustus, like love, friendship, religion, morality, patriotism, the uncertainty of life, the cultivation of tranquility and the observance of moderation. In spite of a rather lukewarm initial reception, the Odes quickly became a capital source of influence, in particular as a model of authorial voice and identity.[For an orientation on the vast subject of the fortune and reception of the Odes see Baldo baldohorace2012.] 
Considering not only the importance of the Odes in the history of Latin and European literature, but also the diversity of the contents and tones of the poems collected therein, we argue that performing SA on such work can lead to interesting results and might represent a use case to open a discussion about the pros and cons of applying SA techniques and resources to literary texts written in ancient languages.

All data presented in this paper are publicly released: <https://github.com/CIRCSE/Latin_Sentiment_Analysis> .","In this paper we have presented a new GS, made of odes written by Horace, for the annotation of sentiment in Latin poetry. The extension of the manually annotated dataset is one of our future work: the goal is to have a sufficient amount of data to test supervised systems.
We have also experimented two different SA approaches that do not require training data: both of them are not able to correctly identify sentences with mixed sentiments, which, in any case, are the most problematic also for human annotators. Table <ref> reports a comparison in terms of precision, recall and F1-score among the lexicon-based approach and the zero-shot classification experiments with both the mBERT and the XML-RoBERTa models. The former performs better on the class whereas the zero-shot method achieves a higher F1-score on the one even if this class is not the most frequent in the training data. Both mBERT and XML-RoBERTa obtain a very high precision on the sentences marked as (0.83 and 1.00 respectively) but the recall is extremely low (0.25 and 0.10 respectively). On the contrary, for the class, the recall is perfect (1.00 for both models) but the precision is very low (0.10 and 0.11 respectively).

A manual inspection of the output of the lexicon-based method revealed two main problems of that approach: i) the limited coverage of LatinAffectus and ii) sentiment shifters are not properly taken into consideration. As for the first point, LatinAffectus covers the 43% of nominal and adjectival lemmas in the GS, leaving out lemmas with a clear sentiment orientation. 

To overcome this issue, we are currently working on the extension of the lexicon with additional 10,000 lemmas. Regarding the sentiment shifters, their impact is exemplified by the following sentence: cum semel occideris et de te splendida Minos fecerit arbitria non Torquate genus non te facundia non te restituet pietas (`When you at last have died and Minos renders brillant judgement on your life, no Torquatus, not birth, not eloquence, not your devotion will bring you back.' - ode IV, 7). Here, the sentiment score calculated by the script is very positive (3) because it does not handle the frequent negations: however, the particle non should reverses the positive polarity of facundia `eloquence' and pietas `devotion'. This problem could be mitigated by modifying the script with rules that take into account negations and their focus.
 
Regarding the zero-shot classification approach, the very low performances on Latin deserve further investigation. It is possible that the problem lies in the data used to build the pre-trained models: i.e., Wikipedia for mBERT and Commoncrawl for XML-RoBERTa. Both resources were developed by relying on automatic language detection engines and are highly noisy due to the presence of languages other than Latin and of terms related to modern times. An additional improvement may also come from using for fine-tuning an annotated in-domain corpus in a well-resource language, that is a corpus of annotated poems: unfortunately, the currently available corpora are not big enough for such purpose.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

This process involves two steps: a) the classification of the textual modifications in amendment acts and b) the integration within a single document of such modifications. In this work we propose a methodology to solve step a) by exploiting Machine Learning and Natural Language Process techniques on the Italian versions of European Regulations: our results suggest that the methodology we propose is a reliable first milestone toward the automatic consolidation of legal texts.","Consolidation consists of the integration in a legal act of its successive amendments and corrigenda.[Eur-Lex, About consolidation, <https://bit.ly/2VFyGhv>] Consolidated texts are very important for legal practitioners. However, their maintenance is a tedious task. Some regulatory publishers such as Normattiva[Normattiva, <https://www.normattiva.it/>] provide continuously updated consolidated texts, others such as Eur-Lex[Eur-Lex, <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/>] do times to times, some other do not. The automation of this process could let institutions to save resources and practitioners to access continuously updated consolidated documents. This achievement would let organizations stay compliant with the normative more easily. The consolidation process involves two main steps: a) the identification and classification of the textual modifications in amendment acts; b) the integration within a single document of the textual modifications identified in the previous step. The first step can be expressed as the automatic classification of textual modifications inside a legal document. In this work, we focus on step a).

Several authors tried to solve this task using standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Ogawa2008 showed that amendment clauses described in the Japanese statutes can be formalized in terms of sixteen regular expressions. Lesmo2009 tried to identify and classify integrations, substitutions and deletions using a three-step approach: 1) prune text fragments that do not convey relevant information, 2) perform the syntactic analysis of the retrieved sentences, 3) semantically annotate the provision using a rule-based approach based on tree. In this last step, they also used a knowledge base that describes the provisions taxonomy <cit.>.[A legislative provision represents the meaning of a law part from a legal point of view. Obligations, definitions and modifications are specific types of provision.] Brighi2008 and Spinosa2009 followed a similar approach. In both cases, semantic analysis is carried out on the syntactically pre-processed text using a rule-based approach. The difference is related to the starting point of the semantic analysis. The former's system relied on a deep semantic analysis of the textual modifications. The latter started from the shallow syntactically parsed text. Garofalakis2016 presented a semi-automatic system for the consolidation of Greek legislative texts based on regular expressions. Francesconi2007 defined a module that automatically classifies paragraphs into provision types. Each paragraph is represented using Bag of words either with TF-IDF weighting <cit.> or binary weight. The authors showed an experimental comparison of the different representation methods using the Naive Bayes and Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MSVM) models.

This paper describes our approach in the classification of textual modifications, namely substitution, addition, repeal and abolition. The proposed approach is based on standard statistical NLP techniques <cit.>. Our method involves i) the use of XML-based standards for the annotation of legislative documents, ii) the construction of the dataset assigning a label to each word according to the tagging format used, and iii) the implementation of NLP models to identify and classify textual modifications. We carried out a systematic comparison among several feature extraction techniques and models. The main contribution of this paper is the application of machine learning models to classify textual modifications. In contrast to rule-based or regular expression techniques, our models do not need expert knowledge about the application domain's properties. They try to extract formulas used to introduce a textual modification without the need for an explicit definition of all the formulas. Our approach leads to lower maintenance costs and hopefully increased robustness of the system.","We presented and analysed a machine-learning approach to the problem of the classification of textual modifications. We compared different tagging formats, feature extractor techniques and machine learning models. Our experiments show that the sliding window approach, combined with char count vectorizer or word embeddings, allows the models to capture most of the formulas that introduce textual modifications. Following Occam's razor principle, we defined simple models that obtained good performances in all the subtasks. Our approach does not need any expertise in the law field since it tries to formalized rules to identify textual modifications. We use different NLP techniques to extract hidden features from the words inside a window.

Results validate our approach in terms of both correctness and stability. They represent the first step to build a fully automatic model capable to identify and integrates textual modifications.

First, data were extracted from the original XML and matched with entries in LiLa, overcoming ambiguities and structural inconsistencies in the source. Subsequently, senses were modelled using the Ontolex Lemon Lexicographic module (lexicog), so that they could be included in the LiLa Knowledge Base and thus made interoperable with the (meta)data of the linguistic resources for Latin therein interlinked.[Copyright 2021 for this paper by its authors.

Particularly over the last two decades, many and diverse linguistic resources have been made available for Latin. These consist in corpora of texts spanning different eras and genres[See, for example, Musisque deoque for Classical Latin poetry <cit.>, CLaSSES, containing epigraphic material <cit.>, the large corpus of Classical Latin prose and poetic texts by LASLA <cit.> and CroALa, which brings together writings by Croatian authors produced between the 10th and 20th centuries <cit.>.], dependency treebanks[Index Thomisticus Treebank <cit.>, Late Latin Charter Treebank <cit.>, UDante <cit.>, PROIEL <cit.> and Latin Dependency Treebank <cit.>.] and lexica[Such as, for instance, valency and subcategorisation lexica <cit.>, the Latin WordNet <cit.> and word lists <cit.>.].
These digital resources join the large set of textual and lexical resources that were created over the centuries for Latin: textual collections, thesauri, lexica, glossaries and mono/bilingual dictionaries. Among the latter, we could mention, for instance, the Oxford Latin Dictionary <cit.>, the Dictionary of medieval Latin from British sources <cit.>, the Forcellini lexicon <cit.> and the still under construction Thesaurus Linguae Latinae <cit.>, many of which are today accessible also in digital format.

However, the impact of these digital resources on the everyday work of classicists is still limited. On the one side, this is due to the still existing divisive dichotomy between “traditional” Humanities and computational approaches. On the other, it is a matter of fact that classicists are not yet put in the best condition to fully exploit all available resources for ancient languages, as these are currently scattered across the web in uncommunicative blocks, using different query languages, data formats, annotation criteria and tagsets. 
The last decade has seen a number of exploratory solutions to tackle the sparseness of linguistic resources. Among them, the European infrastructure CLARIN[<https://www.clarin.eu>.] represents a common hub where data and metadata of resources collected in single repositories (at national level) can be searched (through the so-called Virtual Language Observatory) and processed with different tools (through the CLARIN Language Resource Switchboard). As for Classical languages, Logeion[<https://logeion.uchicago.edu/lexidium>.] is a meta-dictionary that allows to query together the lexical entries of several dictionaries for Ancient Greek and Latin, while Corpus Corporum[<http://www.mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/>.] is a meta-collection that allows searches across more than twenty different corpora for Latin.
However, what such initiatives still lack is to provide a real interoperability between distributed resources, which would result in interaction at both syntactic (structural) and semantic (conceptual) level.
 
Syntactic interoperability is defined as `the ability of different systems to process (read) exchanged data either directly or via trivial conversion', using a common data model consisting of shared protocols and data formats.
Semantic interoperability, on the other hand, is `the ability to automatically interpret exchanged information meaningfully and accurately in order to produce useful results', by using a set of common linguistic data categories defined in ad-hoc ontologies <cit.>.

Attaining syntactic and semantic interoperability between distributed linguistic resources is the objective of the Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) community, which applies the principles of the Linked Data paradigm <cit.> to the (meta)data contained in linguistic resources.
As for Classical languages, the LiLa Knowledge Base (KB)[<https://lila-erc.eu>.] <cit.> makes textual and lexical resources for Latin interact through a commonly used data model, called the Resource Description Framework (RDF) <cit.>, and ontologies developed and shared by the LLOD community. In this way, the linked resources become interoperable with each other as well as with those for other languages described following the same structural and conceptual principles.

Based on a large collection of “canonical forms” (lemmas) - the so-called “Lemma Bank”, LiLa achieves interoperability between resources by linking all those entries in lexical resources and tokens in corpora that point to the same lemma in the LiLa collection.

The lexical resources for Latin linked so far to LiLa include a word formation lexicon <cit.>, a polarity lexicon <cit.>, an etymological dictionary <cit.> and a joint resource providing a manually checked subset of the Latin WordNet and a valency lexicon <cit.>. The most recent among the LiLa connections is the bilingual Latin-English dictionary by Charlton Lewis and Charles Short lewisshort. The inclusion of this type of lexicon in LiLa was much needed, as no resource providing semantic information consisting of translations and definitions was available in the network of connected resources before. Since Lewis & Short is the first lexical resource of its kind included in LiLa, the process of its linking to the KB opened a number of LLOD-related challenges.

This paper describes how such challenges have been tackled and is organised as follows: Section <ref> describes the Lewis & Short dictionary in its main characteristics. Section <ref> discusses the ontologies involved in the modelling phase, the challenges that need to be overcome in the representation of the linguistic data as LLOD (<ref>), and the strategies adopted to represent the dictionary entries using the chosen vocabularies (<ref>). Finally, Section <ref> discusses conclusions and highlights directions for future work.","Perhaps even more than for any other modern language, a great number of lexical resources, either bi- or monolingual, is available for Latin, many of which have already been digitised and disseminated on the web. In this paper, we described a model of how this huge wealth of information can be published using the modern standards of the Semantic Web. The greatest advantage of this approach is that all the lexical resources published according to the same data model can be integrated in a wider network of linguistic information, along with the other digital resources that are connected to it. In the case of the L&S in LiLa, the Latin lexical entries of the bilingual dictionary can be queried together with the information about the same words provided by the other linguistic resources linked to the lemmas in the KB. 

One example of the fruitful interactions between resources is the possibility to investigate the polysemy of words in relation to their derivation, as recorded in the Word Formation Latin resource, which is also linked to LiLa <cit.>. The adjective hosticus of Figure <ref>, for instance, clearly inherits its two main senses (`hostile' and `foreign') from the same polysemy of the noun hostis 'stranger' or 'enemy', from which it is derived. At the same time, while other resources in LiLa describe the senses of words, such as the Latin WordNet <cit.>, the complex relations between those senses (whether, for instance, one sense is interpreted as a specialised derivation from another) is generally available only in traditional lexical resources like the L&S.

The solutions we found to address the challenges raised by the representation of the L&S in LLOD will be reused when we will link further bilingual, as well as monolingual, dictionaries of Latin to the KB.
Including such lexical resources in LiLa is an important achievement, as it makes it possible for the KB to interact with linguistic (meta)data for languages other than Latin. Undoubtedly, such an inter-linguistic (re)use of distributed resources is one of the objectives of the LLOD community, to which LiLa contributes by steadily providing it also with new (kinds of) linguistic resources represented in LLOD.",5,Latin Resources

In this paper, we describe a supervised approach for extracting relations from Wikipedia. In particular, we exploit a self-training strategy for enriching a small number of manually labeled triples with new self-labeled examples.
We integrate the supervised stage in WikiOIE, an existing framework for unsupervised extraction of relations from Wikipedia. We rely on WikiOIE and its unsupervised pipeline for extracting the initial set of unlabelled triples.
An evaluation involving different algorithms and parameters proves that self-training helps to improve performance.
Finally, we provide a dataset of about three million triples extracted from the Italian version of Wikipedia and perform a preliminary evaluation conducted on a sample dataset, obtaining promising results.","The goal of an Open Information Extraction (Open IE) system is to extract relations occurring within a text written in natural language.
Each relation is structured in the form of a triple that is composed by three elements i.e. {(arg1;rel;arg2)}. 
More specifically, given a relation, arg1 and arg2 can be nouns or phrases, while rel is a phrase that denotes the semantic relation between them.
Open IE finds its application in several NLP tasks like Question Answering, Knowledge Graph Acquisition, Knowledge Graph Completion, and Text Summarization.
For this reason, Open IE is gaining ever-growing attention as a research topic. 
Given the nature of the task, approaches for Open IE are deeply intertwined with the language of the corpora that have to be analyzed. 
Due to the availability of English corpora, the majority of the state-of-the-art works are specific for that language. 
For what concerns the Italian language, the model proposed by guarasci2020lexicon relies on verbal behavior patterns based upon Lexicon-Grammar features.
In a previous work, we proposed WikiOIE <cit.>, a framework in which Open IE methods for the Italian language can be easily developed with the aim of encouraging researchers to conduct further work also for under-represented languages.
The first solutions developed in WikiOIE are unsupervised, relying merely on PoS tags patterns and dependency relations. 
In <cit.> the triples extracted by WikiOIE underwent a deep error analysis.
The error analysis reveals syntactic errors such as missing subject or incomplete object information and semantic errors such as generic subject or relation.
In this work, we propose a supervised approach to automatically filter out non-relevant triples provided by WikiOIE and a self-training strategy.
Self-training <cit.> works iteratively: a classification model is trained on labeled data, the trained model is used to classify unlabeled data i.e. pseudo-labels, the classification model is retrained on labeled data and high-confident pseudo-labels.
Specifically, we manually annotate a small number of triples extracted by WikiOIE. Afterward, the annotated triples are augmented using self-training. Finally, the set of triples obtained through self-training at the previous step is exploited to train a supervised model.
The paper is structured as follows: after a brief introduction of state-of-the-art methods for Open IE, Section <ref> provides details about the self-training and the supervised model behind our methodology. Section <ref> reports the results of the evaluation, while Section <ref> closes the paper.","We propose a self-training strategy for implementing a supervised open information extraction system for the Italian version of Wikipedia.
Our approach exploits a small set of manually labeled triples for expanding the training set.
We integrate this system into WikiOIE, which is a framework for open information extraction on Wikipedia dumps.
WikiOIE exploits UDPipe as a tool for processing and annotating the text and can be extended by adding several information extraction approaches.

We perform an extensive evaluation for measuring the impact of self-training on the overall classification performance.
Results prove that self-training is able to improve the classification performance and help to identify not-relevant triples.

Finally, we sampled a subset of extracted triples, evaluated by two experts.
The number of relevant triples increases when the self-training strategy is used by also improving the agreement between annotators.






As future work, we plan to extend the evaluation to a larger scale study, exploit several learning algorithms, and explore the application of the approach to other languages.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis
468_2021,2021,29,"Alessio Miaschi, Chiara Alzetta, Dominique Brunato, Felice Dell'Orletta, Giulia Venturi",Probing Tasks Under Pressure,ENG,5,3,0,"CNR-ILC, Università di Pisa",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"Probing tasks are frequently used to evaluate whether the representations of Neural Language Models (NLMs) encode linguistic information. However, it is still questioned if probing classification tasks really enable such investigation or they simply hint for surface patterns in the data. We present a method to investigate this question by comparing the accuracies of a set of probing tasks on gold and automatically generated control datasets. Our results suggest that probing tasks can be used as reliable diagnostic methods to investigate the linguistic information encoded in NLMs representations.","In recent years we saw the raise of a consistent body of work dealing with the use of probing tasks to test the linguistic competence learned by Neural Language Models (NLMs) <cit.>. The idea behind the probing paradigm is actually quite simple: using a diagnostic classifier, the probing model or probe, that takes the output representations of a NLM as input to perform a probing task, e.g. predict a given language property. If the probing model will predict the property correctly, then we can assume that the representations somehow encode 
that property. 
Studies relying on this method reported that NLMs representations do encode several properties related to morphological, syntactic and semantic information.



Despite the amount of work, there are still several open questions concerning their use <cit.>: 
which probing model should we use for assessing the linguistic competence of a NLM? Are probes the most effective strategy to achieve such goal? These questions fostered two complementary lines of research. The first one is devoted to modifying the architecture of the current probing models; 
the other one is focused on evaluating the effectiveness of probing models. Both are still not well investigated issues, 
although their importance for advancing the research on the evaluation of NLMs linguistic competences has been widely recognized. 


Among the first line of research, dealing with the design of probing classifiers, several works investigate which model should be used as probe and which metric should be employed to measure their performance.
With this respect, it is still questioned if one should rely on simple models <cit.> or complex ones <cit.> in terms of model parametrization.

Specifically, voita2020information suggest to design alternative probes using a novel information-theoretic approach which balances the probe inner complexity with its task performance.






Concerning works facing the issue of investigating the effectiveness of the probing paradigm, hewitt2019designing observe that probing tasks might conceal the information about the NLM representation behind the ability of the probe to learn surface patterns in the data. 
To test this idea, they introduced control tasks, a set of tasks that associate word types with random outputs that can be solved by simply learning regularities. 
Along the same line, ravichander-etal-2021-probing test probing tasks by creating control datasets where a property is always reported in a dataset with the same value, thus it is not discriminative for testing the information contained in the representations. Their experiments highlight that the probe may learn a property also incidentally, thus casting doubts on the effectiveness of probing tasks. 




The scenario defined by the latter two works is the one we deal with in this paper. Specifically, we introduce a new approach to put increasingly under pressure the effectiveness of a suite of probing tasks to test the linguistic knowledge implicitly encoded by BERT <cit.>, one of the most prominent NLMs. To achieve this goal, we set up a number of experiments (see Section <ref>) aimed at comparing the performance of a regression model trained with BERT 
representations to predict the values of a set of linguistic properties extracted from the Italian Universal Dependency Treebank <cit.> and from a suite of control datasets we specifically built for the purpose of this study. We define a control dataset as a set of linguistic features whose values were automatically altered in order to be increasingly different from the values in the treebank, referred to as gold values. Our underlying hypothesis is that 
if the predictions of the increasingly altered values progressively diverge from the predictions of the gold values, this possibly suggests that the corresponding probing tasks are effective strategies to test the linguistic knowledge embedded in BERT representation

We will discuss the results of our experiments in light of this hypothesis in Section <ref>. In Section <ref> we will draw the conclusions. 


Note that this is one of the few studies focused on non-English NLMs. In fact, with the exception of 
<cit.>, the majority of research related to interpretability issues is focused on English or, at most, multilingual models.




 
Contributions To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper that (i) introduces a methodology to test the reliability of probing tasks by building control tasks at increasing level of complexity, (ii) puts under pressure the probing approach considering the Italian language.","In this paper we described a methodology to test the effectiveness of a suite of probing tasks for evaluating the linguistic competence encoded by NLMs. To this aim, we analysed the performance of a probing model trained with BERT representations to predict the authentic and automatically altered values of a set of linguistic features derived from IUDT. 
We observed general higher performance in the prediction of authentic values, thus suggesting that the probing model relies on linguistic competences to predict linguistic properties. However, when we constrained automatically altered values with respect to sentence length, the model tends to learn surface patterns in the data. 


As a general remark, it should be pointed out that our analyses dealt only with sentences showing a standard length (i.e., between 10 and 30 tokens per sentence). This choice, if on the one hand made our results more directly comparable across bins of sentences sharing the same length, on the other hand excluded from the analyses the shortest and the longest sentences of IUDT. 
Our future work will be devoted to replicate the probing task experiments described in this paper also on control datasets comprising sentences whose length is outside of the range considered here. To this aim, we performed preliminary analyses to test the scores of probing tasks on gold IUDT sentences that are less than 10-token and more than 30-token long. 

Interestingly, we noticed that the probing model is less accurate when predicting the linguistic features extracted from the group of IUDT short sentences. Specifically, the average Spearman correlation obtained on such group is 0.47, while probing scores on longer sentences (+30-token long) and on those used in our experiments achieved an average correlation of 0.56 and 0.66 respectively. Starting from this preliminary finding, a possible future investigation could focus on whether using longer or shorter sentences would also have an effect on the probing scores obtained with the control datasets.

In future work we also plan to investigate which features are more diagnostic of the linguistic competence encoded by a NLM and which ones, on the contrary, are more influenced by confounders, such as sentence length.",1,Language Models

Training neural networks requires large amounts of clean data, which are rarely available; many methods have been designed and investigated by researchers to tackle 

this issue.

As a partner of a project, 

we were asked to build translation engines for the weather forecast domain, relying on few, noisy data. Step by step, we developed neural translation models, which 

outperform by far Google Translate. This paper details our approach, that - we think - is paradigmatic for a broader category of applications of machine learning, and as such could be of widespread utility.","The field of machine translation (MT) has experienced significant advances in recent years thanks to improvements in neural modeling. On the one hand, this represents a great opportunity for industrial MT, on the other it also poses the great challenge of collecting large amounts of clean data, needed to train neural networks. MT training data are parallel corpora, that is collections of sentence pairs where a sentence in the source language is paired with the corresponding translation in the target language. Parallel corpora are typically gathered from any available source, in most cases the web, without much guarantees about quality nor domain homogeneity. 

Over the years, the scientific community has accumulated a lot of knowledge on ways to address the problem of the quantitative and qualitative inadequacy of parallel data necessary to develop translation models. Among others, deeply investigated methods are: corpus filtering <cit.>, data augmentation such as data selection <cit.> and back-translation <cit.>, model adaptation <cit.>. They should be the working tools of anyone who has to develop neural MT models for specific language pairs and domains.

This paper reports on the development of neural MT models for translating forecast bulletins from German into English and Italian, and from Italian into English and German. We were provided with in-domain parallel corpora for each language pair but not in sufficient quantity to train a neural model from scratch. Moreover, from the preliminary analysis of data, the English side resulted noisy (e.g. missing or partial translations, misaligned sentences, etc.), affecting the quality of any pair involving that language. For this very reason, we focus on one of the pairs involving English we had to cover, namely Italian-English. 

An overview of the in-domain data and the description of their analysis are given in Section <ref>, highlighting the issues that emerged. Section <ref> describes the previously listed methods together with their employment in our specific use-case. Developed neural translation models are itemized in Section <ref>, where their performance are compared and discussed; our best models outperform by far Google Translate and some examples will give a grasp of the actual translation quality.

We think that our approach to the specific problem we had to face is paradigmatic for a broader category of machine learning applications, and we hope that it will be useful to the whole NLP scientific community.","In this paper we described the development process that led us to build competitive customized translation models. Given the provided in-domain data, we started by analyzing them under several perspectives and discovered that they are few, noisy and heterogeneous. We faced these issues by exploiting a number of methods which represent established knowledge of the scientific community: adaptation of neural models, corpus filtering and data augmentation techniques such as data selection and back-translation. 
In particular, corpus filtering allowed us to avoid the misleading results observed on the original noisy data, while adaptation and data augmentation proved useful in effectively taking advantage of out-of-domain resources.",10,Machine Translation

Towards Identifying Synonymy or Non-Synonymy between Italian Words to Enable Crowdsourcing from Language Learners,ENG,3,1,1,"Università di Bologna, EURAC",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,"Bologna, Trento","English.
We introduce a method to generate candidate pairs of related Italian words sharing (or not) synonymous relations from the ConceptNet knowledgebase. The pairs are intended to generate questions for a vocabulary trainer which combines exercises to enhance vocabulary skills with the implicit crowdsourcing of linguistic knowledge about the semantic relations between words.

Our method relies on the idea that pairs of synonyms in a language tend to translate to pairs of synonyms in other languages. We generated 85k candidate pairs of Italian synonyms that can be used to produce questions for both teaching (3.8k pairs) and crowdsourcing purposes (80k pairs). Follow-up efforts are however needed in order to generate a complementary set of questions.[Copyright ©2021 for this paper by its authors. Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).]","Our efforts target the automatic generation of semantically-related candidate pairs of Italian words with a focus on synonymy. We address a cold start issue for a vocabulary trainer combining exercises to enhance vocabulary skills with the implicit crowdsourcing of linguistic knowledge about the semantic relations between words.

While targeting a specific use case, our method contributes to a larger effort aimed at narrowing gaps on two fronts.
On the NLP front, over the past few decades varied efforts have targeted the efficient creation, extension, and maintenance of resources, including crowdsourcing through platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk <cit.>. Still, the subject remains an open issue.

On the computer-assisted language learning (CALL) front, the automatic generation of exercise content from NLP resources is almost non-existent, despite the fact that some of these datasets encode the knowledge that learners are often tested on (e.g., lexical knowledge). This absence is probably due to differences in expectations with respect to linguistic accuracy: learning materials are usually close to perfect, whereas NLP resources rarely are. Generating content from imperfect datasets poses a challenge in terms of its suitability for learning. 

We contribute to narrowing these gaps by producing data to tackle a cold start issue for a vocabulary trainer designed to both teach language and crowdsource linguistic knowledge from learners. We generate a collection of candidate pairs of Italian words tied to confidence scores, allowing to decide which pairs should be used for learning or for crowdsourcing purposes. 

Our method projects synonymy information in ConceptNet <cit.> from non-Italian onto Italian words.
The obtained results show that we adequately tackle part of the cold start issue, while follow-up efforts are needed to address the remaining part. 

The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section <ref> discusses the specific purpose of our method. Section <ref> summarises related work. Section <ref> and Section <ref> describe how the candidate pairs are generated and scored. Finally, Section <ref> discusses how suitable the pairs are for our specific use case and Section <ref> provides closing remarks.","We presented a method to generate candidate pairs of Italian words that are synonyms or non-synonyms of one another from ConceptNet. These pairs will be used to generate questions used by a vocabulary trainer designed to combine the crowdsourcing of NLP datasets with language learning. While overtime all questions will be used for both teaching and crowdsourcing purposes, part of the pairs generated will at first be used to teach learners while the other part will at first be used to crowdsource knowledge in order to enhance ConceptNet. 
The obtained pairs, known to be correct synonyms in advance, can be served to the learners to improve their vocabulary skills. Another subset, whose correctness is still to be confirmed, can be served to the learners for validation and to decide whether the synonym connection between them should be added to ConceptNet or not.

Our results show that we can produce adequate data to generate part of the questions, while we are still unable to produce the data required to generate the complementary set of questions.
In order to tackle the latter, we are devising a similar approach to identify candidate pairs of non-synonyms. We are adapting our overall procedure for the pairs of Italian words marked as translations of non-Italian words sharing any semantic relations (e.g. antonyms or hyponyms) instead of only considering the ones marked as translations of non-Italian words sharing a synonymy relation.

We are also interested in exploring possibilities to perform a more informed selection of the binary classification algorithm and will explore metrics to quantify the correlation between confidence scores and the quality of the predicted labels (e.g. Pearson, Kendall).

In the future, we aim at running a crowdsourcing experiment with students of Italian as a second language with the produced data.

Taking femicides as an example, we perform a preliminary investigation on a large dataset of news reports and event data covering recent femicides in Italy. First, we revisit the EVALITA 2011 shared task on Italian frame labeling, and test a recent multilingual frame semantic parser against this benchmark. Then, we experiment with specializing this model for Italian and perform a human evaluation to test our model's real-world applicability. We show how FrameNet-based analyses can help to identify linguistic constructions that background the agentivity and responsibility of femicide perpetrators in Italian news.","Frame semantics <cit.> is a theory of natural language understanding with a focus on word meanings (lexical units) and semantic roles (frame elements). The associated FrameNet project <cit.> has resulted in an extensive lexicon and annotated corpus implementing this theory. In the Italian computational linguistics community, there has also been considerable work on frame semantics, mostly focused on creating FrameNet resources <cit.>. However the practical usability of frame semantics for Italian is still largely unexplored. First of all,

on automatic frame semantic parsing (FSP) <cit.>, which has seen considerable recent work on English <cit.>, there has not been any published work on Italian since the EVALITA-2011 shared task <cit.>. Second, a clear perspective on how computational frame semantics can be useful in real-life applications is still missing.


We aim to advance the practical usability of frame semantics in Italian NLP in two ways. 

First, we test how well a recently developed multilingual model (LOME, xia-etal-2021-lome) for FSP performs on Italian. For this purpose we use existing data from the EVALITA 2011 campaign, which is the only reference for Italian on FSP, as well as new “real world"" data collected in the context of the socially relevant domain of femicides. Second, we show how frame semantics can be used in practice to run analysis on real world data. From both efforts, we draw some recommendations for practical developments in Italian FSP.","We took initial steps towards addressing (i) the lack of recent frame semantic parsing models, and (ii) a missing perspective on how frame semantic analysis can be applied in practice.

We adapted the multilingual LOME parser <cit.> to Italian, tested it against the EVALITA-2011 benchmark, and performed experiments to evaluate its real-world performance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that frame semantics can be a valuable analysis tool for analyzing backgrounding (and indirectly, blame attribution) of event participants, and propose news reports about femicides as an example of a domain where this type of analysis is very socially relevant. 

Our results indicate that LOME-based models can achieve acceptable performance, both on the EVALITA benchmark and out-of-domain on femicide reports, even 

without a large quantity of training data. We also found that a cross-lingual approach is useful: training on the concatenation of English and Italian data yields substantial improvements over using only Italian data, and even a zero-shot approach with only English data works quite well. However, our real-world performance analysis highlights key limitations of the Italian data: while models trained on EVALITA can achieve good frame detection performance, they fail when used `end-to-end', with predicate identification seemingly 

the main bottleneck. 

Finally, we performed a preliminary framing analysis of a large dataset covering femicides in Italy. While our analysis method is still in very early stages, we believe that our initial results demonstrate that frame semantics is meaningful for analyzing femicides and other social issues, and that it complements earlier construction-based approaches. In the future, we aim to expand our analysis system to make it usable for different social applications: for example, one could envision systems that can help social scientists test specific hypotheses about media reporting, help activists identify and highlight biased forms of reporting, or help make journalists more aware of their writing and its possible social-cognitive effects.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The text was morphologically analysed to improve the precision of the search process. Some examples of queries are given to show the potential of a text search approach supported by a complex and stratified lexical resource. 60s on the development of the very first question answering (QA) systems already included linguistic resources as support datasets. To bring some “old school” examples, the “General Inquirer” QA system (Stone et al., 1962) used a thesaurus for “coding words as to concept membership” while Simmon’s “Protosynthex” was equipped with a synonym dictionary (Simmons et al, 1963) to “expand the meaning of the question's words to any desired level”. One of the first works specifically focussed on the use of a lexical resource for NLP tasks was about COMPLEX (for “COMPutational LEXicon”), a resource developed at IBM (Klavans, 1988).
The support of linguistic resources has proved its potential in the field of information retrieval (IR) too, as highlighted in many of Bill Woods’ works, culminating in the introduction of his conceptual indexing technique and the conceptual taxonomy resource (Woods, 1997) and later refined in an article entitled “Linguistic Knowledge can Improve Information Retrieval” (Woods, et al, 2000). More recently, other researchers have stressed the importance of the availability of a “Lexical Knowledge Base” (another way to refer to a computational lexicon) in tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation, since their use, in some contexts, can outperform supervised systems (Agirre et al., 2009).
The use of linguistic resources in QA of the earliest period of computational linguistics can be considered as the precursor of “query expansion” (QE), the technique that Manning and Raghavanat describe as the most used “local method” in IR to tackle those situations in which “the same concept may be referred to using different words” (Manning et al., 2008).
Though QE may be obtained in different ways (among which query reformulations based on query log mining) we are here interested in those applications that make use of lexical resources.
Most of the works, published from the 90s to nowadays (proving that QE is still being investigated), exploit WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), the de facto and most widespread ontological (or lexical, depending from the point of view) multilingual resource. Ellen Vorhees was one of the first and used WordNet’s IS_A relations to improve text retrieval (Vorhees, 1993). Moving on directly to the most recent works, WordNet has been used with all its ontological features to expand queries in a semantic text search context in (Ngo et al., 2018) while in (Azad and Deepak, 2019) the authors combined WordNet and Wikipedia for QE, exploiting the first to expand individual terms and the second to expand phrase terms.
The research work here illustrated places itself in the context of full-text search carried out using a lexical resource-driven QE technique. However, the focus of this research, differently from that of the cited works, is not on the specific QE technique and the relative evaluation, but on the resource we chose to exploit, introduced in the next section, in place of WordNet and on the frontend and backend technologies implemented to query the text, as described in details in Section 3. The advantages derived from the adoption of a rich and highly structured computational lexicon will also be remarked through some query examples shown in Section 4. The developed application can be freely accessed and used to query the corpus1.","As shown in this paper, the availability of a rich and structured linguistic resource (as the computational lexicon we have taken into account) seems to provide an edge over the standard query expansion techniques for full- text search based on WordNet. Now that a very first portion of the resource has been made available (though with a preliminary conversion) and the web application has been implemented, the road is cleared for the next steps.
The first critical issue that will need to be faced involves the limitedness of the resource, covering most - but not all - the lemmas, forms, and senses of standard contemporary Italian and that lacks many domain-related terms or senses. To fill this gap the resource will have to be updated and enriched with more entries.
At the same time, as anticipated, a more in- depth and rigorous conversion of PSC will have to be carried out, a process that will probably take a lot of time and research effort and that for the sake of this first experiment would have been premature and unnecessary. As soon as the whole conversion will be ready, the rest of the information encoded in the lexicon will be made available and integrated in the search process.
Though the benefits of the availability of a computational lexicon wrt WordNet (or a similar resource) may seem obvious in a context of QE for full-text search, an empirical evaluation would be desirable. However, the set up of a benchmark conceived for this purpose appears anything but easy, mainly due to the lack of comparable works or evaluation campaigns focussing on the role of linguistic resources as support.
In conclusion, we believe these first experiments carried out by querying the talmudic text appear promising, especially considering that only a small part of the lexicon has been used. In addition, the support in the disambiguation provided by the POS tagging of the text suggests that an hybridization of a resource-driven QE technique with a deeper stochastic annotation of the corpus to be queried may constitute an interesting experimental field to be investigated.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

A Study on Italian Native Speakers’ Perception of Writing Quality,ENG,3,1,0,"Università di Pisa, CNR-ILC",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"This paper presents a pilot study focused on Italian native speakers' perception of writing quality. A group of native speakers expressed their preferences on 100 pairs of essays extracted from an Italian corpus of compositions written by L1 students of lower secondary school. Analysing their answers, it was possible to identify a set of linguistic features characterizing essays perceived as well written and to assess the impact of students errors on the perception of text quality. The paper describes the crowdsourcing technique to collect data as well as the linguistic analysis and results.Copyright ©️2021 for this paper by its authors.

Nowadays, language technologies are more and more exploited to develop educational applications, such as \emph{Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL)} systems \cite{granger-2003} and tools for automated essay scoring \cite{attali-burstein-2006} or automatic error detection and correction \cite{ng-2013}. A fundamental requirement for developing this kind of applications is the availability of electronically accessible corpora of learners' productions. Corpora created so far differ in many respects. For instance, considering the types of examined learners, they can gather productions written by L2 students or by native speakers: the former have been built for many languages (e.g. English, Arabic, German, Hungarian, Basque, Czech, Italian), while the latter are mainly available for English. %, since little work has been carried out for other languages.
In both cases, a peculiarity of existing corpora is that they are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. A notable exception in the context of Italian as L1 -- which is the focus of our contribution -- is represented by \emph{CItA (Corpus Italiano di Apprendenti L1)}, which was jointly developed by the Institute for Computational Linguistics of the Italian National Research Council (CNR) of Pisa and the Department of Social and Developmental Psychology at Sapienza University of Rome \cite{barbagli-2016}: it is the first digitalized collection of essays written by the same group of Italian L1 learners in the first two years of the lower secondary school\footnote{The corpus is freely available for research goals at \href{http://www.italianlp.it/resources/cita-corpus-italiano-di-apprendenti-l1/}{http://www.italianlp.it/resources/cita-corpus-italiano-di-apprendenti-l1/}}.

%As regards L1 Italian learner corpora, which is the focus of our contribution, it is worth mentioning the synchronic corpus of 2,500 compositions written by students of the first year of several high schools in Rome \cite{borghi-2013}, as well as the diachronic one composed by 5,000 productions written by pupils during the five years of elementary school all over Italy \cite{marconi-1994}. However, the state of the art is represented by the \emph{CItA (Corpus Italiano di Apprendenti L1)} corpus, arose from the collaboration between the Institute for Computational Linguistics “A. Zampolli"" of the Italian National Research Council (CNR) of Pisa and the Department of Social and Developmental Psychology at Sapienza University of Rome \cite{barbagli-2016}: it is the first digitalized collection of essays written by the same group of Italian L1 learners in the first two years of the lower secondary school\footnote{The corpus is freely available for research goals at \href{http://www.italianlp.it/resources/cita-corpus-italiano-di-apprendenti-l1/}{http://www.italianlp.it/resources/cita-corpus-italiano-di-apprendenti-l1/}}. 

The diachronic and longitudinal nature of \emph{CItA} makes it particularly suitable to study the evolution of L1 writing competence over the two years, assuming that many remarkable changes in writing skills occur in this period. For instance, in their recent work, \citet{miaschi-2021} showed that it is possible to automatically learn the writing development curve of students: they extracted a wide set of linguistic features from the essays and used them to train a binary classification algorithm able to predict the chronological order of two productions written by the same pupil at different times. 

The present study ranks among research based on \emph{CItA}, but chooses a different approach from the one just mentioned: instead of tracking the development of students' writing competence, we focused on the perception of writing quality by Italian L1 speakers %. More specifically, we try to model this notion from the native's perspective 
with the aim of understanding whether it is possible to find the linguistic features that are crucially involved in the distinction between `better' and `worse' essays according to our target reader.

\paragraph{Contributions} To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that (i) introduces a dataset of evaluated essays in terms of perceived writing quality by means of a crowdsourcing task, (ii) deals with the correlation between linguistic features and perceived quality of writing and (iii) assesses the impact of students errors on quality perception.

%how they distinguish a qualitatively better essay from a worse one. 
%The underlying idea was that, pairing essays written by different students in the same school year (the first or the second), collecting people's preferences for one essay over another of each pair and reconstructing the linguistic profile of all the compositions, we could get a set of linguistic features that play a crucial role in the distinction between better and worse essays. Essentially, we wanted to explicit the criteria that implicitly guide natives through classification task. \textcolor{blue}{We collected human evaluations through surveys and used them to carry out the linguistic analysis}, whose results are reported in the following sections. 

%\todo[inline]{cosa intendi dire con questa frase}The identification of the typical linguistic traits characterizing essays perceived as better or worse underlines the development of educational tools that automatically catch and correct errors or grade written compositions.","We presented a pilot study towards the identification of the linguistic features that are own of well written perceived essays. We collected Italian natives' preferences on 100 pairs of essays written by L1 students, that we analysed in terms of linguistic profiling and errors distribution. Our results reveal an interesting correspondence between annotators' judging criteria and writing instructions that L1 learners receive by teachers. Our findings could be interpreted as an indicator of the reliability of our data and, more in general, could suggest the effectiveness of crowdsourcing methods to quickly build large and reliable datasets. Considering the lack of Italian corpora of graded essays, such datasets could be valuable resources for the development of Computer-Assisted Learning Systems.

The limited size of our dataset certainly reduced the amount of results. Thus, we have to expand it (i) by collecting more annotations for the already existing surveys and (ii) by creating and distributing new surveys in order to gather judgments on new pairs of essays. Analysis on the enlarged dataset could provide more features that are own of good essays. Following the model of <cit.>, we could use the results to train a classifier that, given a pair of essays, recognizes the best written one.

The tool would not presume to replace teachers, but it could be a valuable teaching aid. Students could use it to get an immediate and preliminary self-assessment on their written productions so as to better understand their mistakes and hopefully avoid repeating them. Such tools can be very useful if integrated into educational processes based on distance learning paradigms, which need adequate technological infrastructures to be really efficient.

The Computer Science Department of the University of Turin has designed various technologies that support educational projects and activities in this perspective. 
We implemented an annotation platform for Italian tweets employed in a laboratory called #DeactivHate, specifically designed for secondary school students. The laboratory aims at countering hateful phenomena online and making students aware of technologies that they use on a daily basis.
We describe our teaching experience in high schools and the usefulness of the technologies and activities tested.","Recently, the presence of digital technologies in our lives has grown enormously, with a strong impact on our daily lives. Digital spaces and social media have become a privileged channel for communication, information and socialization, frequented by millions of people at the same time. Along with the new relational opportunities and access to knowledge, even misbehaviour have acquired new visibility and virality, such as hate speech. 
In spite of a causal link between hate speech and crime is hard to demonstrate, the risk of offences and effects on psychological and physical well-being of the victims are clear in psychological and social studies <cit.>. 
The extreme consequence of these effects might be suicide, especially considering the adolescents, as suggested by recent studies investigating the link between cyberbullying and suicidal behaviors of U.S. youth 


<cit.>. To prevent such scenarios, few awareness-raising projects in schools are activated by NGOs in Italy, such as Amnesty International[<http://di.unito.it/silencehateitaly>.] 

or Cifa ONLUS[<http://di.unito.it/iorispetto>.].



The Commissione Orientamento e Informatica nelle scuole[

<http://di.unito.it/orientamentoscuole>.] supports a manifold of activities with the main goal of creating a link between schools and academia, also in the context of the national project Piano Lauree Scientifiche (PLS).

The members of the CCC (Content-Centered Computing) group of the Computer Science Department of the University of Turin, active in the investigation of

hate speech online[<http://hatespeech.di.unito.it/>.], 
have led and participated in several






hate-speech-related projects, 


including “Contro l’odio”[<https://controlodio.it/>.] 
<cit.> a joint work with non-profit entities and University of Bari 

that aims at monitoring hate speech against minorities in Italy. 
Within the current experience, we created a data annotation platform

specifically dedicated to support educational activities and aimed at reflecting on the importance of a conscientious communication. In this perspective,


the idea of #DeactivHate takes hold. This laboratory, addressed at students of 

secondary schools,



is articulated in three main modules with the purpose of:




 
 1) raising awareness about this social problem, encouraging the reflection on microaggressions, hate speech, stereotypes, 
 
 prejudices;
 
 
 2) stimulating the so-called computational thinking and the study of linguistic elements that are exploited by users to offend or to express hate against a victim online (hashtags, emoticons, or figures of speech);
 
 
 3) introducing high schoolers to how tools based on NLP (Natural Language Processing) 
 work to incentivize a more conscious use of technology.



To reach these purposes, 
We designed a series of educational activities that include: analysis of the online problem by means of an investigation on own social networks personal profiles; linguistic analysis of the hateful messages during the annotation of tweets on the “Contro l’odio” annotation platform; 

manual identification of hate speech in Italian texts playing the role of `being an automatic classifier'; translation of this task in a real automatic task, coding two types of classifiers in Python. 
These activities, delivered online due to the pandemic restrictions, have been distributed in 5 meetings 

(lasting 2 hours each) for each class, between April and June 2021, for a total of 10 hours per class.","#DeactivHate represents for Italian high schoolers a first step towards the introduction to subjects such as Linguistics and NLP, that are, for the most part, unknown in Italian high schools, in spite of their relevance in everyday technology. 



Indeed, this kind of laboratory reveals what are the possible hybrid and multidisciplinary applications of Computer Science and Linguistics related degrees, far from the conventional employment opportunities.


Looking at the future,

we would like to enhance the proposed activities in order to make them more interactive even in an online context (such as the DAD) following the example of hiippala2021applied. 


A final remark needs to be made regarding the lack of evaluative strategies that could allow us to understand the impact of #DeactivHate in students' online behaviors or their knowledge of technologies.
Therefore, following the example of bioglio2018social and athanasiades2015internet, 

in the next editions we have planned to employ: surveys before and after the intervention to evaluate the online activity of the students and their experiences about misbehavior (caused or suffered); and interviews to teachers after the conclusion of the laboratory to understand if some changes were perceived with respect to the class group. 


Future activities will integrate also basic evaluations to assess the degree of learning with respect to the contents of the course, such as computational thinking, annotation methodologies, automatic text processing, as well as a final evaluation of the proposed teaching activities collecting the personal impressions of the students.




In addition, to validate also the impact of #DeactivHate in the society 

and, in particular, in the city context

we think to measure the
detection of the amount of hateful message online by means of monitoring platforms, such as the “Contro l’odio” map.[<https://mappa.controlodio.it/>.]",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

These demonstrations of bias can often be classified as a subset of abusive language. However, not as much focus has been placed on the recognition of these instances. As a result, limited data is available on the topic, and only in English. Being able to detect microaggressions without the need for labeled data would be advantageous since it would allow content moderation also for languages lacking annotated data. In this study, we introduce an unsupervised method to detect microaggressions in natural language expressions. 
The algorithm relies on pre-trained word-embeddings, leveraging the bias encoded in the model in order to detect microaggressions in unseen textual instances. 
We test the method on a dataset of racial and gender-based microaggressions, reporting promising results. We further run the algorithm on out-of-domain unseen data with the purpose of bootstrapping corpora of microaggressions “in the wild”, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of our proposed method.[Copyright ©2021 for this paper by its authors. Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).]","The growth of Social Media platforms has been accompanied by an increased visibility of expressions of socially unacceptable language online. In a 2016 Eurobarometer survey, 75% of people who follow or participate in online discussions have witnessed or experienced abuse or hate speech. With this umbrella term, different phenomena can be identified ranging from offensive language to more complex and dangerous ones, such as hate speech or doxing. Recently, there has been a growing interest by the Natural Language Processing community in the development of language resources and systems to counteract socially unacceptable language online. Most previous work has focused on few, easy to model phenomena, ignoring more subtle and complex ones, such as microaggressions <cit.>. 

Microaggressions are brief, everyday exchanges that denigrate stigmatised and culturally marginalised groups <cit.>. 
They are not always perceived as hurtful by either party, and they can often be detected as positive statements by current hate-speech detection systems <cit.>. The occasionally unintentional hurt caused by such comments is a reflection of how certain stereotypes of others are baked into society. 
sue2007 define microaggressions in the racial context, particularly when directed toward people of color, as “brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities”, such as: “you are a credit to your race.” (intended message: it is unusual for someone of your race to be intelligent) or “do you think you're ready for college?” (indented message: it is unusual for people of color to succeed). 
The need for moderation of hateful content has previously been explored. For instance, mathew2019temporal analyses the temporal effects of allowing hate speech on Gab, and finds that the language of users tends to become more and more similar to that of hateful users over time. mathew2019spread further highlights that the spreading speed and reach of hateful content is much higher than with the non-hateful content. As a result, being able to remove instances of hateful language, such as microaggressions, is of great importance.

Previous work on microaggressions with computational methods is quite recent. breitfeller2019finding is one of the first work to address microaggressions in a systematic way, also introducing a first dataset, SelfMA. A further contribution specifically focused on racial microaggression is ali2020automated, where the authors focus on the development of machine learning systems. 

In this study we introduce an unsupervised method for microaggression detection. Our method utilizes the existing bias in word-embeddings to detect words with biased connotations in the message.
Although unsupervised approaches tend to be less competitive than their supervised counterparts, our method is language-independent and thus it can be applied to any language for which embedding representations exist. Furthermore, the reliance of our methods on specific lexical items and their context of occurrence makes transparent the flagging of a message as an instance of a microaggression.
In addition to the usefulness of our method in languages with no labeled data, the reliance of our model on words in the sentences would make it interpretable as it allow human moderators to understand what the system has based its decision on.

Our contributions can be summarised as follows: 

 
 * we introduce a new unsupervised method for the detection of microaggressions which builds on top of pre-trained word embeddings; 
 
 * we compare the performance of our model using different pre-trained word embeddings (Glove, FastText, and Word2Vec) and discuss the potential reasons behind the differences; 
 
 * we test the proposed algorithm on unseen data from a different domain (i.e., Twitter), in order to qualitatively evaluate its efficacy in discovering new instances of microaggression.


 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: 
we introduce our method in Section <ref>. The data 
and our results are reported in Section <ref>. We deploy our model and discuss its limitations in Section <ref>. Finally, we present the conclusion and future work in Section <ref>.","In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm that exploits the existing bias in pre-trained word embeddings to detect subtly abusive language phenomena such as microagressions.
While supervised methods of detection in the field of natural language processing are plentiful, these methods are only viable for languages and topics with available labeled datasets. That is however not the case for many languages. As a result, the unsupervised method of detection introduced in this study could help address the need for the moderation of microaggressions in languages other than English. This is further helped by the availability of multilingual word-embeddings as they would allow the method to be used in any of the languages supported by the embedding.

The method is unsupervised and only needs a small list of seed words. Considering its simplicity, the results obtained from an experiment on a dataset of manually annotated microaggressions are very promising. Further, the method is transparent, explicitly identifying the words triggering a microaggression, and thus paving the way for explainable microaggression detection.

Although the preliminary results are promising, an experiment on unseen data from a different domain shows that there is leeway for improvement.
Given that we are looking at the explicit words used in each message, our method is not sensitive to implicit expressions like “you people"" or “your kind"", often occurring in microaggressions. 
We would have to add further steps to our algorithm to catch expressions like these.

Polysemy is another known issue, e.g., in words like “black"" and “white"" whose relatedness to certain identified trigger words could not necessarily be due to race. While a careful composition of the seed word lists helps to minimize this issue, a systematic approach to polysemy would certainly be desirable.
The seed word list may also be expanded, either manually or exploiting existing lexicons such as HurtLex <cit.> for offensive terms (including stereotypes for several categories of individuals) or specialized lists of identity-related terms[See for instance this compendium of LGBTQIA+ terminology: <https://www.umass.edu/stonewall/sites/default/files/documents/allyship_term_handout.pdf>].

In future work, we plan on improving our model to account for lexical ambiguity, and the complexity derived from the interference between pragmatic phenomena and aggression, e.g., in humorous and ironic messages, following the intuition in recent literature <cit.> about the interconnection between irony or sarcasm and abusive language online.
Our current plan is to apply the algorithm presented in this paper to bootstrap the creation of a multilingual resource of online verbal microaggressions and release it to the research community.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

In this paper we present a large corpus of Twitter data in Italian, manually annotated with hate speech in the political domain. Given the rising amount of hate messages in the public debate, we believe that this is a valuable resource for the NLP community. Here we describe the collection of data and test some baseline with classification algorithms.","In recent years, computer mediated communication on social media and microblogging websites has become more and more aggressive <cit.>. It is well known that people uses social media like Twitter for a variety of purposes like keeping in touch with friends, raising the visibility of their interests, gathering useful information, seeking help and release stress <cit.>, but the spread of fake news <cit.> <cit.> has exacerbated a cultural clash between social classes that emerged after the debate about Brexit <cit.>. Despite the behavior online is different from the behavior offline <cit.>, we observe more and more hate speech in social media, to the point where it has become a serious problem for free speech and social cohesion.

Hate speech is defined as any expression that is abusive, insulting, intimidating, harassing, and/or incites, supports and facilitates violence, hatred, or discrimination. It is directed against people (individuals or groups) on the basis of their race, ethnic origin, religion, gender, age, physical condition, disability, sexual orientation, political conviction, and so forth <cit.>.

In response to the growing hate messages, the Natural language Processing (NLP) community focused on the classification of hate speech <cit.> and the analysis of online debates <cit.>. In particular, many worked on systems to detect offensive language against specific vulnerable groups (e.g., immigrants, LGBTQ communities etc.) <cit.> <cit.>, as well as aggressive language against women <cit.>. An under-researched - yet important - area of investigation is anti-policy hate: the hate speech against politicians, policy making and laws at any level (national, regional and local). While anti-policy hate speech has been addressed in Arabic <cit.> and German <cit.>, most European languages have been under-researched.
The bottleneck in this field of research is the availability of data to train good hate speech detection models. In recent years, scientific research contributed to the automatic detection of hate speech from text with datasets annotated with hate labels, aggressiveness, offensiveness, and other related dimensions <cit.>. Scholars have presented systems for the detection of hate speech in social media focused on specific targets, such as immigrants <cit.>, and language domains, such as racism <cit.>, misogyny <cit.> or cyberbullying <cit.>. Each type of hate speech has its own vocabulary and its own dynamics, thus the selection of a specific domain is crucial to obtain clean data and to restrict the scope of experiments and learning tasks.

In this paper we present a new corpus, called Policycorpus XL, for hate speech detection from Twitter in Italian. This corpus is an extension of the Policycorpus <cit.>. We selected Twitter as the source of data and Italian as the target language because Italy has, at least since the elections in 2018, a large audience that pays attention to hyper-partisan sources on Twitter that are prone to produce and retweet messages of hate against policy making <cit.>.


The paper is structured as follows: after a literature review (Section <ref>), we describe how we collected and annotated the data (Section <ref>), we evaluate some baselines (Section <ref>), and we pave the way for future work (Section <ref>).","We presented a large corpus of Twitter data in Italian, manually annotated with hate speech labels. The corpus is an extension of a previous one, the first corpus annotated with hate speech in the political domain in Italian. Given the rising amount of hate messages online, not just against minorities but more and more against policies and policymakers, it is urgent to understand the phenomenon and train classifiers that could prevent people to disseminate hate in the public debate. This is very important to keep democracies alive and grant a free speech that is respectful of other people's freedom.
We plan to distribute the corpus in the next edition of EVALITA for a specific HaSpeeDe-tw task.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Propaganda is a rhetorical technique to present opinions with the deliberate goal of influencing the opinions and the actions of other (groups of) individuals for predetermined misleading ends. The employment of such manipulation techniques in politics and news articles, as well as its subsequent spread on social networks, may lead to threatening consequences for the society and its more vulnerable members. In this paper, we present PROTECT (PROpaganda Text dEteCTion), a new system to automatically detect propagandist messages and classify them along with the propaganda techniques employed. PROTECT is designed as a full pipeline to firstly detect propaganda text snippets from the input text, and then classify the technique of propaganda, taking advantage of semantic and argumentation features. A video demo of the PROTECT system is also provided to 

show its main functionalities.","Propaganda represents an effective but often misleading communication strategy which is employed to promote a certain viewpoint, for instance in the political context <cit.>. The goal of this communication strategy is to persuade the audience about the goodness of such a viewpoint by means of misleading and/or partial arguments, which is particularly harmful for the more vulnerable public in the society (e.g., young or elder people). 
Therefore the ability to detect the occurrences of propaganda in political discourse and newspaper articles is of main importance, and Natural Language Processing methods and technologies play a main role in this context addressing the propaganda detection and classification task <cit.>. It is, in particular, important to make this vulnerable public aware of the problem and provide them tools able to raise their awareness and develop their critical thinking.


To achieve this ambitious goal, we present in this paper a new tool called PROTECT (PROpaganda Text dEteCTion) to automatically identify and classify propaganda in texts. In the current version, only English text is processed. This tool has been designed with an easy-to-access user interface and a web-service API to ensure a wide public use of PROTECT online. To the best of our knowledge, PROTECT is the first online tool for propagandist text identification and classification with an interface allowing the user to submit his/her own text to be analysed.[The video demonstrating the PROTECT tool is available here <https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ao-qMrhQAfYtkzD69JPAYY3nSFub?e=oUQbxQ>]


PROTECT presents two main functionalities: i) the automatic propaganda detection and classification service, which allows the user to paste or upload a text and returns the text where the propagandist text snippets are highlighted in different colors depending on the propaganda technique which is employed, and ii) the propaganda word clouds, to show in a easy to catch visualisation the identified propagandist text snippets. PROTECT is deployed as a web-service API, allowing users to download the output (the text annotated with the identified propaganda technique) as a file. The PROTECT tool relies on a pipeline architecture to first detect the propaganda text snippets, and second to classify the propaganda text snippets with respect to a specific propaganda technique. We cast this task as a sentence-span classification problem and we address it relying on a transformer architecture. Results reach SoTA systems performances on the tasks of propaganda detection and classification (for a comparison with SoTA algorithms, we refer to <cit.>).


The paper is structured as follows: first, Section <ref> discusses the state of the art in propaganda detection and classification and compares our contribution to the literature. Then Section <ref> describes the pipeline for the detection and classification of propaganda text snippets as well as the data sets used for the evaluation and the obtained results. Section <ref> describes the functionalities of the web interface, followed by the Conclusions.","In this paper, we presented PROTECT, a propaganda detection and classification tool. PROTECT relies on a pipeline to detect propaganda snippets from plain text. We evaluated the proposed pipeline on standard benchmarks achieving state-of-the-art results.

The recent breakthroughs in the field of deep learning have lead to state-of-the-art results in several Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). Nevertheless, the training requirements in cross-linguistic settings are not completely satisfying at the moment. The datasets suitable for training VQA systems for non-English languages are still not available, thus representing a significant barrier for most neural methods.
This paper explores the possibility of acquiring in a semi-automatic fashion a large-scale dataset for VQA in Italian. It consists of more than 1 M question-answer pairs over 80k images, with a test set of 3,000 question-answer pairs manually validated. To the best of our knowledge, the models trained on this dataset represent the first attempt to approach VQA in Italian, with experimental results comparable with those obtained on the English original material.","Multimodal information processing is crucial to deal with a wide array of human actions and real-world computer applications. Notably, when observing a real-world scene, agents – both human and virtual ones – should understand what kinds of objects it depicts and the relations occurring among them. Such understanding allows agents to reason about the scene and the context in which it appears, thus inferring additional information that can be used for different purposes.

In recent years, several Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks have been proposed in order to challenge systems in drawing inferences from multimodal inputs bringing together both linguistic and visual contents.
An important task boosting research in multimodal scenarios is represented by Visual Question Answering <cit.>. This task consists of correctly answering natural language questions regarding an input image. This requires the integration of vision, language and commonsense knowledge to answer.
In English, several benchmark datasets have been proposed to deal with visual reasoning and question answering <cit.>. 
However, despite the impressive advances obtained in this context thanks to both new available resources and models, other languages still lack large-scale datasets suitable to learn VQA models.

In this paper, we present the semi-automatic creation of GQA-it, a large-scale Italian dataset based on the balanced version of GQA <cit.>. Specifically, we obtained more than 1 million question/answer pairs in Italian over 80K images by applying Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and we manually validated 3,000 examples to provide a valuable benchmark.
Moreover, we adapted to Italian a state-of-the-art VQA neural architecture, namely LXMERT <cit.>, and we trained/evaluated it using GQA-it. 
The experimental evaluation in both languages shows comparable results. 
This result is particularly significant given the complexity of the task and the adoption of noisy, automatically translated material for training. To the best of our knowledge, this represents one of the first Italian VQA systems. GQA-it will be made available to the research community.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section <ref> summarizes related work. Section <ref> describes the new GQA-it dataset. Section <ref> presents the experimental evaluation obtained by creating a new model by using GQA-it. Conclusions and future work are drawn in Section <ref>.

GQA-it has been obtained with machine translation, and the quality of the resulting resource is demonstrated through both direct evaluation of the translation and indirect evaluation of a state-of-the-art model trained on this material. 

This work represents a first step to leverage a large-scale VQA resource like GQA for Italian, a resource whose quality can still largely been improved. In particular, the knowledge graphs behind each image will be extremely valuable to improve the final resource (e.g., using a generation process as in <cit.>) or the VQA process. 
Finally, the available alignment between GQA and GQA-it will foster research in cross-lingual VQA.

The aim of this paper was to explore the possibility of semi-automatically inducing large-scale Italian dataset for VQA. Obviously, we are aware that there is plenty of room for improvement in many respects. First, a wide range of approaches could be tested, aimed at reducing the noise due to the adaptation of English resources to Italian ones. Specifically, a viable option could be to leverage the question and the image together with each other in order to provide a more consistent translation. 
Finally, a multimodal masked language modeling step on text-image pairs could enrich the Italian BERT model and make it comparable with the English counterpart. We plan to probe these research avenues in the near future.",1,Language Models

The de facto method for zero-shot cross-lingual SLU consists of fine-tuning a pretrained multilingual model on English labeled data before evaluating the model on unseen languages. However, recent studies show that adding a second pretraining stage (continued pretraining) can improve performance in certain settings. This paper investigates the effectiveness of continued pretraining on unlabeled spoken language data for zero-shot cross-lingual SLU. We demonstrate that this relatively simple approach benefits either SF and IC task across 8 target languages, especially the ones written in Latin script. We also find that discrepancy between languages used during pretraining and fine-tuning may introduce training instability, which can be alleviated through code-switching.","In task-oriented dialogue systems, a Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) component typically involves intent classification (IC) and slot filling (SF) <cit.> tasks. For example, in “Show me the fares for Delta flights from Dallas to San Francisco“, the intent is asking an airfare and its corresponding slots are Delta (airline-name), Dallas (city-origin), and San Francisco (city-destination). Scaling SLU models to other languages is still challenging, especially when there is limited or no labeled data available in the target language <cit.>. 

To approach this problem, previous work studies IC and SF tasks in a zero-shot cross-lingual setting <cit.>, where it is assumed that a labeled dataset is only available for a high resource language (e.g., English). With the rise of pretrained multilingual language models (LMs) <cit.> the most common approach is by fine-tuning the pretrained multilingual model on the English labeled data, and then evaluate the model directly on the target language data that are not seen during fine-tuning. 

While direct fine-tuning serves as a strong baseline, pretrained LMs are not necessarily universal and they may need domain-specific adaptation. Recent works have shown that adding a second pretraining stage (or continued pretraining) before fine-tuning can give positive impact on the model performance <cit.>. During continued pretraining, we continue training the pretrained language model using a domain-specific or task-specific unlabeled dataset, with the same masked language model objective. This stage is useful to alleviate the domain mismatch between the original pretraining and the target task data. By continued pretraining on domain specific unlabeled data, the model acquires prior knowledge which is expected to be helpful in the fine-tuning stage. This approach has shown promising results on text classification, typically on English. However, it remains unclear whether it is applicable in the context of zero-shot cross-lingual SLU.

In contrast to previous work which has mostly focused on English classification tasks, we investigate the effectiveness of continued pretraining for zero-shot cross-lingual SLU tasks on eight target languages. Our study reveals that the existing continued pretraining method <cit.>, that is successful in English text classification tasks, does not always generalize to the context of zero-shot cross-lingual SLU. We focus on the following research questions:


 
 (Q1) Is continued pretraining effective for zero-shot cross-lingual SLU tasks? 
 ↪ Our experiments on the MultiATIS++ dataset <cit.> reveal that incorporating continued pretraining on intermediate English data can improve performance over direct fine-tuning for all languages, on zero-shot SLU. The performance gain is especially evident for languages with Latin script writing system. The benefit of continued pretraining diminishes as we inject cross-lingual supervision in the fine-tuning stage, even with simple data augmentation through code-switching. 
 
 
 
 
 (Q2) What are the factors that influence the effectiveness of the continued pretraining stage?

 ↪ Using the target language for continued pretraining before fine-tuning on English can be detrimental to the overall performance. However, this can be largely alleviated by code-switching the fine-tuning data. We also observe that performance improvement are not obtained by merely adding more continued pretraining data; higher domain similarity between the continued pretraining data and the fine-tuning data is indeed more important.","We systematically study the effectiveness of continued pre-training of a multilingual model on intermediate English unlabeled spoken language data for zero-shot cross-lingual tasks, namely intent classification and slot filling, on 8 languages. Our results show that the domain knowledge learned in English is transferable to other languages. 
The gain from continued pre-training diminishes as we inject cross-lingual supervision in the fine-tuning stage. There are several factors that influence the effectiveness of the continued pre-training: (i) Using different language between pre-training and fine-tuning can hamper performance and introduce instability in the model training, which can be alleviated with code switching. (ii) Domain similarity is important. The more similar – in terms of data distribution – the intermediate data to the target dataset yields better performance.

It was demonstrated that the upper layers of these models capture semantic information.
This evidence paved the way for the development of sense representations based on words in context.
In this paper, we analyze the vector spaces produced by 11 pre-trained models and evaluate these representations on two tasks.
The analysis shows that all these representations contain redundant information. The results show the disadvantage of this aspect.","The introduction of contextualized embedding models, such as ELMo <cit.> and BERT <cit.>, allows the construction of vector representations of lexical items that adapt to the context in which words appear.
It has been shown that the upper layers of these models contain semantic information <cit.> and are more diversified than lower layers <cit.>.

These word representations overcame the meaning conflation deficiency that affects static word embedding techniques <cit.>, such as word2vec <cit.> or GloVe <cit.> thanks to the adaptation to the context of use.



The evaluation of these models has been conducted mainly on downstream tasks <cit.>.
With extrinsic evaluations, the models are fine-tuned, adapting the vector representations to specific tasks.
The resulting vectors are then used as features in classification problems.
This hinders a direct evaluation and analysis of the models because the evaluation also takes into account the ability of the classifier 
to learn the task.

A model trained for this kind of task may learn only to discriminate among features that belong to each class with poor generalization.

The interpretability of neural networks is an emerging line of research NLP that aims at analyzing the properties of pre-trained language models <cit.>.
Different studies have been conducted in recent years to discover what kind of linguistic information is stored in large neural language models.
Many of them are focused on syntax <cit.> and attention <cit.>.
For what concerns semantics, the majority of the studies focus on common knowledge <cit.> and inference and role-based event prediction <cit.>.
Only a few of them have been devoted to lexical semantics, for example, DBLP:conf/nips/ReifYWVCPK19 show how different representations of the same lexical form tend to cluster according to their sense. 

In this work, we propose an in-depth analysis of the properties of the vector spaces induced by different embedding models and an evaluation of their word representations.
We present how the properties of the vector space contribute to the success of the models in two tasks: sense induction and word sense disambiguation.
In fact, even if contextualized models do not create one representation per word sense <cit.>, their contextualization create similar representations for the same word sense that can be easily clustered.

Statistics and hyperparameters of the models.","We conducted an extensive analysis of the semantic capabilities of contextualized embedding models. We analyzed the vector space constructed using pre-trained models and found that their vectors contain redundant information and that their first two principal components are dominant. 

The results on sense induction are promising. They demonstrated the effectiveness of contextualized embeddings to capture semantic information. We did not find higher performances from more complex models, rather, we found that RoBERTa, a model that was developed by simplifying a more complex model, BERT, was one of the best performers. Neither the dimension of the hidden layers, the size of the training data, nor the size of the vocabulary seems to play a big role in modeling semantics. As stated in previous works, inserting an anisotropy penalty to the objective function of the models could improve directly the representations. We also noticed that, even if BERT models and XLNet have different objectives and are trained on different data, they have similar performances. It emerged that these models are less redundant than others.

The conclusion that we can draw from our analysis and evaluation is that pre-trained language models can capture lexical-semantic information and that unsupervised models can be used to distinguish among their representations. On the other hand, these representations are redundant and anisotropic. We hypothesize that reducing these aspects can lead to better representations. This operation can be carried out post-hoc but we think that training new models keeping this point in mind could lead to the development of better models.

FONTI 4.0[<csc.dei.unipd.it/fonti40en/> (last accessed September 2nd, 2021)] is a project aiming at exploring the suitability of automatic transcription and analysis tools for the preservation of historical oral sources recorded on analog carriers, in particular magnetic tapes. 
The digitization of an audio archive is a long and expensive task that can require several years. Furthermore, the content of audio recordings needs to be listened and cataloged for making audio recordings retrievable. Archives composed by hundreds or thousands of hours of audio require a huge amount of time, people and funds for making the content accessible and preventing their exploitation. Therefore, automatizing the transcription and the analysis task could drastically reduce the time for making digitized audio recordings accessible. 

The project consists in a transcription-chain (T-chain), firstly defined in <cit.>, but differs in two main aspects: (a) in FONTI 4.0, the transcription obtained with speech-to-text (STT) algorithms should not be corrected by human; (b) an additional restoration step could be required for digitized audio recordings. Furthermore, differently from STT evaluation experiments conducted by <cit.>, we decided to employ two commercial software, namely Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services, to test their ability to transcribe historical analog recordings, and to eventually to our pipeline.

During the digitization process, speed and equalization errors can occur, especially when different speed and equalization configurations are used in different part of the same tape <cit.>. This leads to distortions of the recorded signal that becomes unlistenable. By using the correction workflow and digital filters described in <cit.> these errors can be corrected and at least parts of the signal can be saved. This task is essential for making the speech signal suitable for STT algorithms. 
This paper aims at evaluating the transcription performance of two commercial software on a real use case and identifying potential problems or limitations concerning peculiarities of analog audio recordings. Section <ref> describes the corpus, used as ground-truth for the experiment. Section <ref> outlines the methodology adopted for this experiment, whereas results are reported in Section <ref>. Finally, Section <ref> presents the authors' conclusions.","In this article we conducted a preliminary research experiment testing the ability of STT software to correctly transcribe digitized historical oral sources on magnetic tape. It should be noted, that since this preliminary work has been conducted on a small sample of data, our results are only indicative of which elements represent the biggest obstacle for STT software performance.

In spite of disturbing elements and the variation of audio quality in the recordings, we demonstrate that with our dataset and in terms of WER, AT performed more accurate transcriptions compared to GCS . On the other hand, GCS was better at recognizing foreign words. Table <ref> shows that AT introduces less incorrect words but more insertions and substitutions. This should be taken into consideration when working with automatic information extraction tools (e.g., Named Entity Recognition algorithms) applied to automatic transcriptions. Further analysis should investigate the cause of this trend, to verify if this behavior is also due to alignment or tokenization errors. 

With respect to software performance evaluations in relation to variables characterizing analog recordings of speech, we found evidence that audio quality drastically impacts on the number of mismatches. Observations about the incidence of disturbing elements, on the other hand, cannot be generalized since sub-corpora are in three different languages and have three different sizes. Throughout the analyses we noted that the most negative impact on transcription, in terms of the increase of WER, is caused by the presence of some specific recurring elements, i.e.: code-switching (foreign), overlaps and probably even the production of L2 speakers (Figure <ref>).
Nonetheless, given the necessity of preserving historical documents in a more time and cost effective way, we came to the conclusion that researchers working on the preservation of historical recordings will benefit from the use of the T-chain. This is because the reduction by half of the time required for manual transcriptions in slow motion does compensate the lack of accuracy. This means that researchers working on the collection and preservation of oral archives will be able to focus on filling the gap between human and machine output. 

Further contributions will be necessary for conducting experiments on L1 and L2 data separately, cross-language testings reducing the Italian subset to the size of the French and Spanish sub-corpora and evaluating the impact of incorrect transcriptions on WER. Language identification through code-switching is another important problem for automatic transcription. Both services recently provided this functionality, but while we are writing this paper, the Google Cloud is still a preview version. As soon as the feature will be available the performance of automatic language recognition algorithms should also be investigated, especially because this feature is essential for automatizing the transcription of entire archives.",13,Multimodal

The system translates questions from Italian language to SQL explaining an interlingua represented by a logical formalism such as relational calculus.
 There are two specific features of
 this project: first, the use of relational calculus as semantic representation for interlingua translation; second, the role played by pragmatic information, that
 is the Mediterranean diet domain implicitly encoded in the schema database.","Access to large numbers of data by ordinary people is one of the many challenges faced for years to allow a smoother interaction between man and machine. The nature of human communication presents many aspects difficult to formalize through precise rules: ambiguity in the use of words and expressions, cultural and idiomatic differences, the reliance on implicit information given by the context. 
This is also true in specific domains, such as the one that binds people to food 
<cit.>.

For this purpose, the Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) have been the subject of research for several years, systems able to interpret, model and execute a question formulated in Natural Language on some kind of basis of knowledge (bases of data, ontologies, etc.). The applications are therefore among the most diverse, from the simple search bars of a website, to the latest Voice Assistant and other services also web-based <cit.>.

The use of natural language has advantages and disadvantages compared to formal languages such as queries written in one of the database query languages. One of the advantages is the user's familiarity with natural language. One disadvantage is the extreme expressiveness of human language, which makes a total coverage of the vocabulary impossible and therefore possible interpretations of the meaning. 






In this work we present an NLI to question a database in the domain of the Mediterranean diet. A question about this domain expressed in Italian will be analyzed through the use of a grammar feature-based context-free, represented by the relational calculation on tuple, and finally transformed into SQL through a recursive process based on the pragmatic of the application domain. A distinctive element of this project, compared to the classic examples of conversion based on the logic of the first order <cit.>, is the explicit use of relational calculation to represent the meaning of the sentence.
Moreover, an important role is played by the pragmatic domain, which binds the language used in questions to the formalization of recipes, and which is codified in the database schema.","In this work were presented the first results of a project still in progress to interpret a question in natural language as an SQL question in the domain of the Mediterranean diet. The two main features of this project were the use of relational calculation on tuple to represent the meaning of the sentence (Section <ref>) and the use of domain specificities to then transform this representation into SQL (Section <ref>).

In the future we intend to complete the questions contained in the proposed corpus and then integrate the prototype into a conversational agent on the domain of the management of a healthy diet. Considering the presence of indeterminateness in natural language, it might be interesting to provide support for extensions of the relational model that treat indeterminateness <cit.>.

While previous work showed differences at various linguistic levels between age groups when experimenting with written discourse data (e.g., blog posts),
previous work on dialogue has largely been limited to acoustic information related to voice and prosody.
Detecting fine-grained linguistic properties of human dialogues is of crucial importance for developing AI-based conversational systems which are able to adapt to their human interlocutors. We therefore investigate whether, and to what extent, current text-based NLP models can detect such linguistic differences, and what the features driving their predictions are.
We show that models
achieve a fairly good performance on age-group prediction, though the task appears to be more challenging compared to discourse.
Through in-depth analysis of the best models' errors and the most predictive cues, we show that, in dialogue, differences among age groups mostly concern stylistic and lexical
choices.
We believe these findings can inform future work on developing controlled generation models for adaptive conversational systems.

In this work, we focus on one particular aspect that may influence conversational agent success: user age profile. We investigate whether the linguistic behaviour of conversational participants differs across age groups using state-of-the-art NLP models on purely textual data, without considering vocal cues.
We aim to detect age from characteristics of language use 
and adapt to this signal, rather than work from ground-truth metadata about user demographics.
This is in the
interest of preserving privacy, and from the perspective that while age and language use may have a relationship, this will not be linear <cit.>
and there are individual differences.

Previous work on age detection in dialogue has focused on speech features, which are known to systematically vary across age groups. For example, Wolters et al. wolters2009age learn logistic regression age classifiers from a small dialogue dataset 
using different acoustic cues supplemented with a small set of hand-crafted lexical features, while Li et al. li2013automatic develop SVM classifiers using acoustic and prosodic features extracted from scripted utterances spoken by participants interacting with an artificial system. In contrast to this line of work, we investigate whether different age groups can be detected from textual linguistic information rather than voice-related cues. We explore whether, and to what extent, various state-of-the-art NLP models are able to capture such differences in dialogue data as a preliminary step to age-group adaptation by conversational agents.

We build on the work of Schler et al. schler2006effects, who focus on age detection in written discourse using a corpus of blog posts. The authors learn a Multi-Class Real Winnow classifier leveraging a set of pre-determined style- and content-based features, including part-of-speech categories, function words, and the 1000 unigrams with the highest information gain in the training set. They find that content features (lexical unigrams) yield higher accuracy (74%)
than style features (72%),
while their best results (76.2%) are obtained with their combination.
We extend this investigation in several key ways: (1) we leverage state-of-the-art NLP models that allow us to learn representations end-to-end, without the need to specify concrete features in advance; (2) we apply this approach to dialogue data, using a large-scale dataset of transcribed, spontaneous open-domain dialogues,
and also use this approach to replicate the experiments of Schler et al. schler2006effects on disccourse;
(3) we show that text-based models can indeed detect age-related differences,
even in the case of very sparse signal at the level of dialogue utterances; and finally (4) we carry out an in-depth analysis of the models' predictions to gain insight on which elements of language use are most informative.[Code and data available at: <https://github.com/lennertjansen/detecting-age-in-dialogue>]

Our work can be considered a first step toward the modeling of age-related linguistic adaptation by AI conversational systems. In particular,
our results can inform future work on controlled text generation for dialogue agents <cit.>.","We investigated whether, and to what extent, NLP models can detect age-related linguistic features in dialogue data. We showed that, in line with what we observed for discourse, state-of-the-art models are capable of doing so with a reasonable accuracy, in particular when the dialogue fragment is long enough to contain discriminative signal. At the same time,
we found that
much simpler
models based on n-grams achieve comparable performance, which suggests that, in dialogue, `local' features can be indicative of the language of speakers from different age groups. We showed this to be the case, with both lexical and stylistic cues being informative to these
models in this task.


While we
performed the classification task at the level of
single dialogue utterances, future work may
take into account
larger dialogue fragments, such as the entire dialogue or a fixed number of turns.
This would
make the setup more comparable to discourse, 
but would
require making experimental choices and dealing with extra computational
challenges.
Moreover,
it could be tested
whether the language used by a speaker is equally discriminative when talking to a same-age
(this work)
or a different-age interlocutor.

Finally, we believe our findings could inform future work on developing adaptive conversational systems. Since consistent language style differences were found between age groups (for example, at the level of exclamatives and acknowledgments), systems whose language generation capabilities aim to be consistent with a given age group should therefore reproduce these patterns. This could be achieved, for example, by embedding one or more discriminative modules that
control
the generation of a system's output, which could lead to better, more natural interactions between human speakers and a conversational system.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

We built a dataset composed of Italian sentences derived from the speech of an expert guide leading visitors in cultural sites, enriched with multimodal features, and labelled on the basis of the perceivable engagement of the audience. We run experiments in various classification scenarios and observed the impact of modality-specific features on the classifiers.","During face-to-face interactions, the average speaker is generally very good at estimating the interlocutor’s level of involvement, without the need of an explicit verbal feedback. He/she only needs to interpret visually accessible unconscious signals, such as body postures and movements, facial expressions, eye-gazes. 
The speaker can understand if the addressee is engaged with the discourse, and continuously fine-tune his/her communication strategy in order to keep the communication channel open and the attention high in the audience.[Recent studies have shown that the processing of emotionality in prosody, facial expressions and speech content is associated in the listeners' brain with enhanced activation of auditory cortices, fusiform gyri and middle temporal gyri, respectively, confirming that emotional states are processed through modality-specific modulation strategies <cit.>.] 


Understanding of non-verbal feedback is not easy to achieve for virtual agents and robots, but this ability is strategic for enabling more natural interfaces capable of adapting to users. Indeed, perceiving signals of loss of attention (and thus, of engagement) is of paramount importance to design naturally behaving virtual agents, enabled to adjust the communication strategy to keep high the interest of their addressees. That information is also a general sign of the quality of the interaction and, more broadly, of the communication experience. At the same time, the ability to generate engaging behaviors in an agent can be beneficial in terms of social awareness <cit.>.



The objective of developing a natural behaving agent, able to guide visitors along a tour in cultural sites, was at the core of the CHROME Project[Cultural Heritage Resources Orienting Multimodal Experience. http://www.chrome.unina.it/] <cit.>, and the present work is intended in the same direction. More specifically, this paper explores the possibility to predict audience engagement in the context of guided tours, by considering acoustic and linguistic features of the speech of an expert guide leading visitors inside museums. 



The paper is organised as follows: Section <ref> draws a brief overview of related works in the field of engagement annotation and prediction; Section <ref> describes in details the construction of the dataset; Section <ref> reports the methodology adopted to extract features specific for both linguistic and acoustic modalities; Section <ref> illustrates the set of experiments conducted on the collected data, in terms of classification scenarios and features used; Section <ref> gathers final observations and ideas for future works.



 
Contributions The main contributions in this paper are: i) a novel multimodal Italian dataset with engagement annotation; ii) multiple classification scenarios experiments; iii) impact of modality-specific features on multimodal classification.","In this paper we introduced a novel multimodal dataset for the analysis and prediction of engagement, composed of Italian sentences derived from the speech of an expert guide leading visitors in cultural sites, enriched with multimodal features, and labelled on the basis of the perceivable engagement of the audience. 
We performed several experiments in different classification scenarios, in order to explore the possibility to predict engagement on the basis of features extracted for both the linguistic and acoustic modalities. Combining modalities in classification leads to good results, but with a filtered set of features to avoid too noisy representations. An in interesting experiment would be to combine the outcomes of two different systems (one exploiting exclusively acoustic features, linguistic features the other) rather than using a monolithic one fed with all the features.
This technique often leads to better performances with respect to the decisions taken by a single system <cit.>.

The grammatical gender system can influence the way the semantic gender is perceived. Italian is a grammatical gender language, in which nouns are classified for gender.
In this work, we investigate the usage of gender-specific forms of occupational titles in a diachronic corpus of 3 billion tokens extracted from two Italian newspapers. The hypothesis is that the usage of gender-specific forms might be influenced by socio-cultural aspects, such as changes in the employment policy.
We automatically collect a set of occupational titles and perform a diachronic analysis exploiting the frequency of gender-specific forms.
Results show a correlation between changes in the usage of gender-specific forms and socio-cultural events.","Throughout history, the prerogative use of specific gender forms over particular professions can fade away by introducing changes in the language lexicon (e.g., neologisms) or in the language usage (e.g., word frequencies).


The way the lexicon is affected by those changes depends on the grammatical gender system, i.e. the set of rules that define the agreement between noun classes forms and the other parts-of-speech.
Grammatical gender systems can vary dramatically from one language to another. gygax2019 propose a classification of languages based on their grammatical gender system.







In this work, we focus on the Italian language, a grammatical gender language in which all nouns must be classified for gender.
The Italian gender system admits three categories for nouns: gender-specific ending nouns, mobile gender nouns, and nouns where the gender is specified through determiners and adjectives <cit.>. 
In gender-specific ending nouns, the gender forms are expressed through completely different lexical roots (e.g., genero/nuora).

In mobile gender nouns, the specific gender forms share the same lexical root, and the semantic gender is instead represented by different suffixes (e.g., scrittore/scrittrice).
In other cases, the semantic gender of a noun is inferred only by the determiner and/or adjective (e.g., il giudice, la giudice).
The peculiar characteristic found in the Italian language has strong repercussions in the way people refer to occupational titles, because a specific gender form might be preferred over the other due to historical reasons, regardless of the gender of the actual person being talked about <cit.>.
This has become a hot-button issue in the last years, especially as a result of the United Nations Resolution Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its global indicator framework for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and specifically of SDG 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls (sub-goal 5.1 End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere) <cit.>. 





The objective of this paper is to monitor how the use of gender-specific occupational titles has changed in the Italian language over the years through the use of diachronic analysis tools.
We would like to emphasize that the goal is not to map the composition of men and women for each profession over time, as this cannot be reliably inferred from text.
Instead, we are interested in gauging the cultural relevance of the gender-specific titles over time, as reflected in the news domain.
Accordingly, the contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows:

(i) We analyze emerging trends in the use of gender-specific occupational titles in the Italian language in a corpus of newspaper articles.[All data collected in this experiment is available here: <https://github.com/pierluigic/igsot>]


(ii) We perform a deep-dive analysis of the figures that have guided a significant shift for two professions in particular.

Large diachronic corpora have already been used to study social and cultural phenomenons that affected language in a significant way.

The Google Ngrams Dataset <cit.> is a dataset of n-grams extracted by 3.5 million books published between 1520 and 2008.
DBLP:conf/dihu/AidenM11 exploit the huge quantity of information contained in the Google Ngrams Dataset to analyze the evolution of the language lexicon over time.
In particular, the work offers interesting culturomics results, such as highlighting the spread of the term influenza during historical pandemic periods.
DBLP:conf/acl/KutuzovVO17 exploit diachronic word embeddings to track wars and conflicts that took place from 1994 to 2010 all around the world. Diachronic word embeddings are trained on the English Gigaword news corpus <cit.> and used to predict conflict states: peace, war and stable.

The authors hypothesize that occupational titles and agents would be more resistant to change than other forms of sexism over the decades.
They confirm their hypothesis by exploring the frequencies of male and female affixes, showing that they keep stable.
burr1995 performs an empirical analysis on manually-annotated occurrences of grammatical agents in a small synchronic corpus of Italian newspapers. The outcomes of this work lead the authors to conclude that women are underrepresented in Italian newspapers, especially in more high-position roles.","This paper investigates the usage of gender-specific forms of occupational titles in the Italian language in a diachronic corpus of 3 billion tokens extracted from two popular Italian newspapers.
Through this analysis, we show that there are significant changes in the way newspaper articles refer to the masculine and feminine form of an occupational title and that they are consistent with socio-cultural events, such as changes in the employment policy.
Moreover, we performed a more fine-grained analysis by extracting the most influential figures that have guided this shift for two occupational titles (male dancers and female poets).
As future work, we propose to continue work on this field by increasing the size of the corpus and by including sources other than news, such as social media, job applications, and legal documents.
This can help reduce any form of linguistic bias that may have been introduced by journalists and increase the significance of the results.
Moreover, we will extend the list of occupational titles, as well as group titles together based on category.
Finally, we propose to improve the process used to extract named entities that are associated with occupational titles in text.",21,Gender and Inclusive Language Studies

In this paper, we propose OCTIS 2.0, an extension of the existing framework that integrates both a single-objective and multi-objective hyper-parameter optimization strategy, using Bayesian optimization.

to precision medicine and smart solutions/suites for hospitals or individual doctors. 
They rely on large-scale and reliable automatic processing of vast amounts of heterogeneous data, i.e., images, lab reports and, most importantly, textual medical documentation.

The current paper focuses on Medical Discourse Analysis: imposing structure on digitalized
health reports through document segmentation and labeling of relevant segments (e.g., ). Identifying and interpreting discourse fragments is essential for accurate and robust Information Extraction from medical documents. In terms of doctor assistance, such a system could quickly and reliably identify 
the most crucial parts of voluminous health records, allowing to highlight them for improved visibility and thus 
reducing cognitive load on doctors. For example, a highlighted problematic diagnosis can alert a doctor perusing a large medical dossier. 
In terms of automated data analytics, discourse structure is crucial for correct interpretation of extracted information.
For example, if we want to study a possible correlation between the use of a specific medicine and some outcome, we should only consider documents where this medicine is mentioned as a part of , but not as a part of .

Some medical documents are generated using task-specific eHealth software 
imposing certain discourse structure. In Italy, however, there is no single software adopted at either national or regional levels. While there is a general agreement on the nature of information to be included, 
there are no guidelines or programmatic implementations for structuring it. In addition, historical records, produced before the adoption of recording software, follow the logic of individual doctors and thus show even more variability. 
We aim therefore 
at a statistical model that is able to infer the discourse structure without making any assumptions on the recording software. 

An important advantage of our approach is its adaptability to new domains (e.g., radiology reports) or languages as well as its robustness in the (highly probable) scenario where new report-generating systems appear at the market.


Several recent studies (Section <ref>) focus on segment labeling for medical records in English. To our knowledge, no approach has been proposed so far to analyze medical discourse structure automatically in other languages, including, most importantly, Italian. The required research is hampered by the lack of resources in other languages, ranging from no data annotated for discourse structure, either for training or for benchmarking, to lack of high-coverage resources, e.g., taxonomies, required for such projects. In our study, we propose a language transfer approach to the problem of medical discourse analysis in Italian. We first investigate possibilities for training robust monolingual models (Section <ref>) and then build upon our monolingual results to transfer the model in another language (Section <ref>).","This paper presents a language transfer approach to unraveling discourse structure of clinical notes, focusing on diagnosis and procedure.

We empirically investigate two translation-based architectures, showing that both of them outperform a generic cross-lingual pipeline. The approach based on translating train data is more robust and efficient (at runtime) compared to translating the test data, yielding more stable performance.

In future, we plan to expand our study to cover other types of discourse segments, such as allergy or history. However, our first experiments with procedure segments show that, unlike diagnosis, modeling and even annotating other headers require a more tight collaboration with medical experts.",20,In-domain IR and IE

In fact, it is becoming increasingly evident that the goodness of hate speech prediction systems, and of NLP algorithms in general, is rooted in how well they capture and model all the relevant characteristics of language in the context of a specific phenomenon and its evolution over time <cit.>.

The recent availability of long-term and large-scale digital corpora and the effectiveness of methods for representing words over time can play a crucial role in the recent advances in this field.

They represent the ideal communication context to address the challenges we have outlined. 

This paper aims to characterize how the online conversation on the Italian Twitter around the first Covid-19 lockdown, imposed in Italy in 2020, shifted very quickly from one heated debate to another one, following the
quick succession of news reports on both news cases and institutional advice and rules on how to navigate everyday life as the crisis was unfolding in the entirety of the world.

We hence performed the same task using an abusive language computational lexicon, Hurtlex <cit.>.
We discovered the most recurrent types of abusive language, their distribution over time and correlation with real life events regarding the ongoing pandemic.

It is worth noting that extracting obligations from such a big amount of regulations is tedious and repetitive work. In this scenario having systems to automate this process might be very useful to cut down the costs. Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) may come in help. However, given the variety of legal sources, training this kind of system is a complex activity because it requires a sufficient amount of annotated data, which are expensive especially if the annotations require legal domain experts. 

The obligations extraction topic has been already studied with different approaches. bartolini2004automatic used a shallow syntactic parser and hand-crafted rules to automatically classify laws paragraphs according to their regulatory content and extract relevant text fragments corresponding to specific semantic roles. Similarly sleimi2018automated represent automatically legal texts semantics using an RDF schema with a system based on a dependency parser and hand-crafted rules. sleimi2019query used the same representation to build a question-answering system with a focus on obligations. biagioli2005automatic represent law paragraphs using Bag of words either with TF or TF-IDF weighting <cit.> and used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify each paragraph as a type of provisioning including obligations.

Automatic text summarization aims at condensing one or more source documents in a shorter output, which contains their most salient information. The underlying task can be framed in two different manners: extractive summarizers select the most relevant segments from the input and produce a summary which is a concatenation of such segments; as a result, the output is a subset of the original text, which the summary follows verbatim. On the other hand, abstractive summarizers aim to encode the whole source into an internal representation from which they generate the summary; thus, they produce a new piece of text that condenses the source without necessarily using its vocabulary and expressions.

The lead section (from the Wikipedia' own page), which we consider as the article summary. We use the remaining of the article as the source.



Recently, abstractive summarization has attracted a growing interest in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. Sequence to sequence models have been increasingly used for the task, with pre-trained encoder-decoder transformers becoming the de facto state of the art for abstractive text summarization. Normally pre-trained in an unsupervised manner, these models are then fine-tuned in a supervised way on the downstream dataset; during fine-tuning, the model learns to generate the summary from the source document.

While various datasets for abstractive summarization exist for English, resources in other languages are limited. This paper introduces WITS (Wikipedia for Italian Text Summarization), a large-scale dataset for abstractive summarization in Italian, built exploiting Wikipedia. 
Taking advantage of the structure of Wikipedia pages, which contain a lead section (Figure <ref>) – giving an overview of the article's topic –, followed by the full-length article – describing the topic in details –, we create a large and challenging dataset for abstractive summarization in Italian, which we will make publicly available. 

WITS is particularly challenging, given its large source length and its high abstractiveness. 
In this paper, we describe the dataset, its statistics and characteristics, and report some preliminary experiments that might be used as baselines for future work. 

This paper is organized as follows: in Section <ref>, we describe the state of the art in text summarization, focusing on resources for Italian. We later preset the dataset and its related task (Section <ref>); we describe the data collection and preprocessing process in Sections <ref> and <ref>. In Section <ref>, we show our results when summarising the dataset using some existing extractive baseline models. Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section <ref>.","We have presented WITS, the first large-scale dataset for abstractive summarization in Italian. We have exploited Wikipedia's articles' structure to build a challenging, non-technical dataset, with high-quality human-written abstracts. Given the lengthy source documents, the short summaries and the short extractive fragments, the dataset calls for an abstractive approach. In the paper, we have explored some standard non-neural extractive baselines and a neural abstractive baseline. Future work will investigate further neural baselines for the dataset. Moreover, the dataset can be easily extended applying the procedure described in the paper to more languages, including low-resource ones given Wikipedia structure. We are confident that research in summarization in languages other than English will become more active in the near future and hope that WITS can be a valuable step in this direction.

In this paper we introduce T-PAS Scraper, a new online application for linguistic data extraction and analysis connected to the T-PAS resource, a corpus-based digital repository of Italian verbal patterns (Ježek et al., 2014). The application is conceived as a supplementation of the main functions of T-PAS and can be used concurrently with the resource, thus extending its accessibility. It consists of 25 different scripts which operate automatically on the database of the resource and can be useful for quantitative and qualitative studies of the linguistic data it contains.","T-PAS Scraper is a new online application for linguistic data extraction and analysis. It is designed as an extension and supplementation of T-PAS resource (Ježek at al., 2014), a corpus-based digital inventory of Italian verbal patterns, which provide syntactic and semantic information on the verb-argument structures (that is, the patterns).
Initially, the project was not conceived as online application for the linguistic analysis of T-PAS resource data. The first idea was to find a way to speed up the revision of the resource: we needed a fast system that could facilitate the manual correction of annotators’ mistakes within the patterns contained in the editor of the resource. As the dimension of the resource is considerable (T-PAS is a repository of 5326 patterns), checking all of them manually while going through the correction and refinement phase would have been time-consuming. Annotators’ mistakes are not widespread within the resource as most of the work performed on T-PAS was carried out manually, but isolated errors can occur.
As a solution, we developed a series of T-PAS-specific scripts running on the updated T-PAS resource database (a JSON-structured file containing all the patterns and the related information), which can extract lists of aggregated data, displayed in columns. By skimming the lists, one can easily notice data errors in the extracted data and therefore correct them by moving to the editor of the resource and editing the patterns which were wrongly annotated.
As the number of scripts that we developed was consistent, covering several aspects of the resource, we believed that they would have been useful for users and not only for annotators’ revision. We decided to build an online application, which is called T-PAS Scraper, that extends T-PAS accessibility: it can be used by future T-PAS users for quantitative and qualitative studies of its linguistic data.
In this paper we describe the application in its components, how it is related to T-PAS resource and some possible uses.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we briefly describe the T-PAS resource, its main features and the online interface. In Section 3 we introduce T-PAS Scraper and provide a technical explanation on how it was built; we also present the main functions of T-PAS Scraper, and in which sense they are complementary to T-PAS resource, as well as how it can be used from a user perspective. In Section 4 we discuss some future perspective on the project.
T-PAS resource
T-PAS (Ježek et al., 2014) is a corpus-derived resource consisting of an inventory of Typed Predicate-Argument Structures (T-PAS) for Italian verbs. It is a gold standard for Italian verb-argument structures. The resource is being developed at the University of Pavia with the technical support of Lexical Computing Ltd. (CZ) and is intended to be used for linguistic analysis, language teaching, and computational applications. The resource consists of four fundamental components:
a repository of corpus-derived predicate argument structures (called patterns) with semantic specification of their argument slots, e.g. [Human] drinks [Beverage];
an inventory of ca. 200 corpus-derived semantic classes (called Semantic Types) organised in a hierarchy (called System of Semantic Types), used for the semantic specification of the arguments;
a corpus of manually annotated sentences that instantiate the different patterns of the verbs in the inventory. Corpus lines are tagged with their respective pattern numbers and anchored to the verb they feature, which is the lexical unit of analysis;
an editing system called Skema (Baisa et al., 2020), which allows the registration of patterns and all the syntactic and semantic information associated therewith and facilitates the manual annotation of corpus instances (directly linked to the patterns).
Typed predicate-argument structures are patterns that display the semantic properties of verbs and their arguments: for each meaning of a verb, a specific pattern is provided. As referenced above, the patterns are corpus-derived, i.e., they are acquired through the manual clustering and annotation of corpus instances, following the CPA methodology (i.e., Corpus Pattern Analysis; Hanks, 2013). Currently, T-PAS contains 1165 implemented verbs, 5,326 patterns, and ca. 200,000 annotated corpus instances.
In the resource, each pattern is labelled with a pattern number and connected to a list of corpus instances realising that specific verb meaning. The Skema editor enables the registration of different semantic and lexical information in each pattern: the verb, which in T-PAS is generally in its infinitive form - e.g., bere (Eng., ‘to drink’); the Semantic Types (e.g. [Human], [Beverage], always portrayed within square brackets), specifying the semantics of the arguments selected by the verb; argument positions, which are filled by the Semantic Types in the patterns; the sense description, i.e. a brief definition of the meaning of the verb in that specific pattern; a lexical set (optional) for each Semantic Type in the pattern, i.e. a selection of the most representative lexical items instantiating that Semantic Type (e.g. vino = ‘wine’ | birra = ‘beer’ | aranciata = ‘orange juice’ are good candidates for the lexical set of [Beverage]); the roles (optional) played by some specific Semantic Types in certain contexts: in particular, the Semantic Type [Human] can acquire the role of Athlete, Doctor, Musician, Host, Guest, Writer, etc., depending on the verb selecting it as an argument; the features (optional) associated with the Semantic Types, i.e. certain semantic characteristics required by the pattern syntax (e.g. Plural) or by the specific verb meaning (e.g. Female, Negative, Visible); prepositions (for prepositional complements); particles (for adverbials); complementizers (for clausals); quantifiers, and determiners (for lexical sets), which can be implemented according to the specific argument position in question.
The System of Semantic Types used to classify the semantics of arguments (Pustejovsky et al., 2004; Ježek, 2019) is a hierarchy of general semantic categories obtained by manual clustering of the lexical items found in the argument positions of corpus-derived valency structures. The System currently contains ca. 200 Semantic Types that are hierarchically organised on the basis of the ‘is a’ (subsumption) relation (e.g. [Human] is an [Animate]).
T-PAS online version, which will be publicly available for the users by the end of 2021, will consist of:
the repository of predicate-argument structures (patterns);
five good corpus examples (GDEX; Kilgarriff et al., 2008) for each of the patterns (previously annotated);
the System of Semantic Types;
a search engine that allows to search Semantic Types and argument positions (subject, object, etc.) in combination.
T-PAS Scraper aims at completing and integrating T-PAS functionalities: the two interfaces can be used complementarily when visualizing the pattern and searching for specific linguistic phenomena.
T-PAS Scraper
Building T-PAS Scraper
T-PAS Scraper is, in its first release, constituted by two parts: the scripts to retrieve the data from T-PAS database, which were created using Python and PyCharm, and a graphical interface that produces a cross-platform executable program.
The program can load a Sketch Engine-compatible database, select a script, and run it. Once clicked on the “Run script” button (see Figure 1), a JSON file is produced with the requested content (i.e., the list of extracted data). Every script is different and prints different complex data in its output, but the way in which data is structured is identical in all of them.
The online user application was created by programming a web application with Angular, a popular front-end framework, PrimeNG, a component library, and Express, a NodeJS server that allows the application to be loaded on Heroku, a hosting company. The procedure followed in order to develop this application consists of two steps: first of all, the scripts were formally defined using a pseudocode, the linguistic data that are the object of the extraction. In the second phase, each script was implemented and printed on a JSON file.

Figure 1. T-PAS Scraper program with the list of scripts that can be run on the JSON database
The online interface (see Figure 2) consists of several parts. First, a menu indicates the top categories of scripts that can been chosen. The top categories are Verbs, Semantic Types, Arguments and Lexical Sets; each of them contains a group of related scripts. For each top category there is a description page and a list of several scripts. Once a script has been selected, the data is shown in table format (generally long lists with different columns), with the possibility of filtering and paging the results in different ways. Data are displayed in alphabetical order, based the first column on the left (containing the verbs). There is also the option to export the current script in Excel format, which can be handy for studying the data externally.
Using T-PAS Scraper
T-PAS Scraper is useful to access semantic and syntactic information about verbs and their arguments, which cannot be accessed in T-PAS online in aggregate (see Section 2). The basic idea that underlies T-PAS Scraper usage is to have an aggregated overview of the lists (i.e., columns) of data being extracted.
As for the verbs, one can visualize the complete list of the 1165 verbs with different information: the number of patterns for each verb (and what is the average number of patterns, as well as which verbs have the highest number of patterns); the frequency and per-million frequency in the corpus (to check whether the frequency is somehow related to the number of patterns of that specific verb). The entire inventory of 5326 patterns contained in T-PAS online, together with the related sense description is provided, both separately and jointly. Verbs in patterns can be registered differently from their base form (i.e., the infinitive) or show for examples reflexive uses, and therefore the entire list of the verb forms can be filtered in order to obtain those forms (e.g., lavarsi, Eng. ‘to wash yourself’).
The complete inventory of the 212 phrasal verb patterns annotated in the resource (e.g., buttare via, Eng. ‘to throw away’) and 388 idiomatic uses (e.g., bersi il cervello, ‘to go crazy’) can also be searched, also in parallel to the patterns in T-PAS online for explanatory examples.
As for Semantic Types, one can search for the most frequent alternations of Semantic Type in argument positions (Ježek et al., 2021; see Figure 2 column 4 for examples) as well as the semantic roles and the features associated to the Semantic Types (see Section 2).
For what concerns the arguments, a list of the argument structures is provided (e.g., subject-object, subject-clausals, subject-prepositional complement) as well as those which are optional and obligatory. Syntactic alternations of arguments (e.g., finire il pranzo (object) vs. finire di mangiare (clausals) – Eng., ‘to finish the meal’ vs. ‘to finish eating’) are also listed.
Finally, complementizers, prepositions, adverbial particles, and obligatory determiners annotated within the patterns in T-PAS, as well as lexical sets, can be extracted through T-PAS Scraper and analysed by the researcher in their distribution.
In Table 1 we provide some quantitative data regarding T-PAS resource, that can be extracted through T-PAS scraper.

Table 1. Summary of the quantitative data from the scripts","In this paper we introduced T-PAS Scraper, a new online application for linguistic data extraction and analysis specifically devised to retrieve the data contained in the T-PAS resource and make them available to users for purposes of linguistic analysis, thus extending T-PAS resource accessibility. We described why and how it was built and its main functions related to T-PAS resource. We also suggested some possible uses in terms of qualitative and quantitative analysis, from a user perspective.
As a new-born project, T-PAS Scraper application is just at its initial stage and further work can be done. In particular, new scripts can be added to enrich the existing ones.
Currently, the data displayed on the application are in a static form: the updated database needs to be manually re-uploaded in case of some changes in T-PAS editor. The final goal would be to load the data from T-PAS database within Sketch Engine in real time, run the scripts and show the results: in a first phase the data will be displayed in this way. Loading data directly from Sketch Engine also requires coordination and the creation of a dedicated API with external authentication, which does not currently exist. A dynamic infrastructure has countless advantages: it allows to view data in real time, it is scalable and functional, and can also communicate with other systems.
T-PAS Scraper may eventually be extended to resources other than T-PAS whose structure is compatible with the database configuration of T-PAS and Sketch Engine.

Nowadays conversational recommendation systems seem to be acquiring a fundamental role in information seeking and retrieval. In a recent paper, Hayati and her colleagues <cit.> have argued for the need to study the communication strategies used by human speakers in a natural setting for developing dialogue systems that are able to make successful and persuasive recommendations. The authors have proposed Inspired, a dataset of recommendation dialogues collected in a realistic setting, enriched with a detailed annotation of the sociable recommendation strategies employed by the Recommender. 


However, as in any interaction, these dialogues are the result of the cooperation between the interlocutors, who actively partake in both the construction of meaning and of the relationship among each other <cit.>: the Seeker’s contribution, as well as the Recommender’s, shapes the development of the communicative exchange, in that the seekers may use specific strategies to disclose their preferences and reach their goal, i.e., to get items that suit their needs.
Hence, modelling the Seeker’s communicative strategies along with the ones used by the Recommender may improve the efficiency of recommendation dialogue systems.


In this work, we aim to fill this gap proposing a tagset for the Seekers communicative strategies that is coherent with the one previously provided for the Recommenders by Hayati and colleagues.
The paper is structured as follows: recommendation dialogue systems are considered in relation to the Argumentation Theory ( <ref>) and the Inspired tagset <cit.> is described ( <ref>), then the tagset for the Seeker's strategies is presented ( <ref>), along with the data proving the reliability of the annotation scheme ( <ref>) and a preliminary analysis of the interactions ( <ref>).[The present study is the result of a collaborative work of all the authors. Paragraphs 2 and 2.1 have been written by Martina Di Bratto, paragraph 3 by Marta Maffia and Ancuta Budeanu, 3.1 and 4 by Riccardo Orrico and, finally, sections 1 and 5 by Loredana Schettino.]","This work is supported by the idea that studying communication strategies used by human speakers is fundamental to improve the performances of dialogue systems. This was already supported by Hayati and her colleagues (2020) who analyzed the Recommenders' sociable strategies in recommendation dialogues to develop successful and persuasive recommendation dialogue systems. However, considering the cooperative nature of dialogues, we argue that annotating the Seeker’s move may be pivotal in the training phase of recommendation dialogue systems. 
Hence, we propose an annotation scheme for the Seeker’s utterances that is coherent with the annotation of Recommender’s utterances. Considering the Seeker's role and main moves, we have drawn four categories: recommendation requests, global requesting strategies, giving preference strategies and local requesting strategies.
Results on the reliability of the annotation scheme show that the agreement between the 5 annotators ranges from substantial to almost perfect <cit.> for most strategies but one, i.e., the strategy used to ask for movies of a specific genre. Similarly, observing the other cases of disagreement, we find that they mostly concern the identification of global and local requesting strategies. We showed that in most of these cases annotators failed to agree on whether an utterance contained a second strategy (manly a specific title request). In this cases, some annotators assigned a second label believing that the more specific request was generated as a conversational implicature stemming from the Seeker's mention of a certain movie title or attribute and the expression of his/her own opinions and experiences. 
The fact that most of the cases of disagreement fall within this situation might also explain why we registered high levels of disagreement for the get_from_genre label. Observing the confusion matrix (Figure 1), what can be noticed is that this category has been frequently confused with the no_label one. An explanation of this phenomenon could be found in utterances like ""I love sci-fi movie"" to which only the first label as personal_opinion_pos has been assigned. Nonetheless, other annotators also added get_from_genre as second label, for the reason explained above. We believe that this does not specifically depend on the strategy per se, but simply on the fact that genre is the feature of a movie that most frequently was mentioned by the Seekers (30% of the total features, as opposed to i.e. actors and directors, occurring respectively, in 20% and 4% of the cases), therefore more frequently led the annotators to assign different strategies. A finer analysis of the turn by turn strategies of the two participants on a larger number of dialogues would be informative about the extent to which Recomemenders make the inference (and act on it). This would help understand how to treat these cases. 



Concerning the general distribution of the Seekers’ strategies, positive personal opinion and non-present personal experience seem to be more frequent than the global and local requesting strategies. 
The strategies distribution along with the dialogue turns, on the other hand, shows that the first turns are mainly characterized by the occurrence of recommendation requests, reflecting the Recommender's strategy of offering help. In the middle of the conversation, requests for getting information or movie titles increase together with personal opinion and personal experience, even if the latter seems to be more equally distributed. This distribution could reflect the fundamental role of the Seeker in modelling the conversation. In the first phase of exploration the Seekers’ personal opinions are explicitly elicited by the Recommenders’ inquiries. Instead, in the exploitation phase, the Seeker could also provide soft evidence of their preferences, which may be used by the Recommender to help the Seeker find a suitable item. This attitude is very common in human-human dialogue with respect to the human-machine interaction, since it follows the principles of cooperative dialogue <cit.>.
For this reason, Recommender systems that adopt a proactive behaviour and take the initiative to provide a piece of information that is not explicitly requested, should be able to better achieve the user needs and fulfil the goal of the dialogue <cit.>.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

However, dialogues are rarely put in an explicit relationship with the graph structures representing the knowledge domain. In this work, we show how native graph databases provide a framework for a deeper understanding about the use of domain items during dialogue. We describe a multiple-source data collection procedure and we describe how linguistic concepts related to common ground can be found in graph structures. We also describe different patterns that can be detected in the obtained graph structures and discuss their implications in the design of dialogue systems for the movie recommendation task.","Copyright ©️2021 for this paper by its authors.

Graph-based data have become popular as support tools for a number of Natural Language Processing tasks, from Word Sense Disambiguation using node embeddings <cit.>, to Knowledge Base Collection <cit.> and Fraud Detection <cit.>. Most recent approaches involving the use of graph databases converge towards numerical representations of the included items for use by machine learning algorithms <cit.>. Knowledge structures using Labelled Property Graphs, however, are typically designed to be more interpretable by human researchers, who can also setup informative queries to extract latent knowledge from a number of cross-referenced resources. 

This suggests that the same resources supporting dialogue systems can be queried by human experts to extract deeper understanding about the use of domain items, supporting explainability. This implies that it is necessary to explicitly cross-reference dialogue corpora with domain knowledge, while the two are typically considered separately. 


In this paper, we describe a multiple-source data collection procedure to cross-reference an annotated English dialogue corpus covering the movie recommendation task, the Internet Movie Database and Wikidata. We present the relationship common ground concepts (see Section <ref>) have with graph structures and we present a set of examples concerning dialogue analysis performed in the graph. The main research questions are:


 
 * Q1: How to represent dialogues and domain knowledge in a single graph structure?
 
 * Q2: Is it possible to formalise common ground concepts guiding dialogue analysis in the resulting graph?
 
 * Q3: Is it possible to use the resulting graph to extract interpretable patterns to guide dialogue systems design?


The paper is organised as follows: in Section <ref> we describe the considered resources and how they were cross-referenced in a graph database. In Section <ref>, we provide a deeper discussion about Common Ground representations and their relationship with graph databases. Section <ref> shows how dialogue history, connected with domain knowledge, can be queried to extract knowledge characterising the use of domain items in the considered (sub-)dialogues. This is of interest for the open challenge concerning the study of Argumentation-Based Dialogue which, as opposed to Argumentation-Based Inference, is an area that is still lacking a theoretical framework of reference <cit.>.","Graph databases have a great potential as linguistic tools for dialogue analysis, modelling interaction dynamics and domain knowledge in the same resource. While this representation provides a powerful support to dialogue systems through machine learning, it can be integrated by more informed design based on a qualitative analysis of the same graph structures. We presented a data collection procedure for a large graph database representing dialogue dynamics explicitly linked to domain knowledge. In the representation of such data, different kinds of Common Ground were identified as sub-graphs. We then, used it to investigate the choice of domain items supporting sociable conversational strategies. Concerning the research questions we were interested in investigating, the data collection procedure presented in Section <ref> presents how a graph database can organise and connect, at the same time, both dialogue history and domain knowledge, providing an example answering Q1 for the specific case of the movies recommendation dialogues. This is, then, generalised in Section <ref> by identifying linguistic concepts related to common ground that are described in terms of sub-graphs, independently of the specific domain. Recurring patterns involving both dialogue and common ground structures can, then, be identified using graph traversal queries. Specifically, we have characterised the different use of MOVIE and PERSON nodes depending on the order of appearance in a pattern where the referring nodes are linked by the relationship WORKED_IN, in the CCG. By analysing the sociable strategies involved in the patterns in which the specific domain items may occur, we described how the different use of the same node categories in opposite patterns (i.e., MOVIE followed by PERSON; PERSON followed by MOVIE) can be typical of a specific recommendation dialogue phase. The obtained data describe a way of managing Exploration and Exploitation phases informing the design of conversational recommender systems. We have also shown that, in selecting which PERSON items to use when adopting sociable strategies, RECOMMENDERs seem to prefer PERSONs with mid-skewed distributions over movie genres, suggesting that opinions about these PERSONs may give insight about sub-genres. Future work will consist of empowering the analyses by relating more complex numerical item representations, like node embeddings, to dialogue dynamics.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

Italian. The article illustrates the results of an experiment within which TAL technologies have been used to support the drawing up of a children's dictionary, in particular with regard to the formulation of definitions and the updating of the keywords. The results achieved are promising and show the potential for synergy to be strengthened in the publishing sector.","Awareness of the potential of artificial intelligence (IA) methods and techniques in the publishing sector is spreading rapidly. The White Paper on The Future Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Publishing Industry (2019) reports the results of an international survey from which it emerges that 25% of the publishing companies interviewed have already invested in applications of IA techniques within different sectors, ranging from marketing and distribution to publishing.
Within the scenario just outlined, a central role is played by methods and techniques for the Automatic Treatment of Language (TAL), which are now mature in order to contribute significantly to the different phases of the publishing process, allowing - for example - to index on a semantic basis the information content of a text, to monitor its complexity and communicative effectiveness in relation to the type of recipients, to guide its possible reformulation, to verify the possible presence of plagiarism, or to provide support to the phases of linguistic and typographical control.
In this contribution, we report the results of a first and promising experiment jointly conducted by the Mondadori Education Publishing House and the CNR Computational Linguistics Institute, within which TAL technologies were used to support the design of the new edition of a children's dictionary: the Devoto-Oli Junior (DJ). In particular, the themes of the control, evaluation and specialisation of the dictionary in relation to the audience of the recipients were addressed, trying to reconcile two apparently contrasting perspectives, the accessibility of the contents on the one hand and their informativeness on the other.
The product Dictionary
A publishing house has with its dictionary a complex relationship: work of remarkable editorial and economic commitment; publication of prestige and, as it uses to say, of brand positioning; produced with diffusion and decreasing profits.
Experimenting in ways, times, targets and mistakes is a luxury that belongs to the past; hence the need for a more reliable, faster approach, without waste: therefore, scientific-technological. And, as will be best described below, the TAL benefits from a lexicographic editing in the construction of the keywords, also in relation to the target market.
Whatever the lexicographic setting is positive, historical-linguistic or with a valent taste, the choice of the keyword is, first of all, a marketing matter: there is no dictionary on the market today that will not flaunt the number of voices or lemmas, meanings, neologisms.
It is easy to understand that, at the time of purchase, an exterminated lemary is a guarantee of the ability of the dictionary itself to solve our problems (at least those lexical and orthographic, it means). Yet the seduction of a universe by alphabetical order confronts two inevitable industrial problems: the number of pages and the cost. A book, understood as a physical object, has its own ergonomics and there are physical limits beyond which binding operations become senseless and unwelcome consultation. Then there is a direct mathematical relationship, as the commercial directors reminiscent of incessantly between the number of pages and cost: in the world of Google and Wiktionary, the price is a very delicate deal, if not for institutional buyers, certainly for families.
A particular challenge is then a dictionary with a reference school target: if in fact a vocabulary of use has totalizing ambitions, a vocabulary for the school is an ontologically editorial operation as it is based on the ability to choose and cut out a plausible and useful linguistic world.
Operation not so trivial when considering the ambivalence of the language to which the students are exposed: on the one hand, basic vocabulary that they employ with greater or lesser proficiency; on the other hand, technical and technical-scientific disciplinary vocabulary of which school texts are understandably rich (alniscient, antagonist, exarchate, tectonic, phospholipidic etc.). And, as is easy to imagine, this ambivalence will invest both the choice of voices and the construction of the single definition.
The new edition of a dictionary
The design of the new edition of the DJ focused on two main issues:
the language used in the definitions, its complexity and effective accessibility for the user to whom the work is intended, i.e. children aged 8 to 13 years;
the keyword, its verification and its update almost ten years after the first edition, given to the prints in 2012.
3.1 The complexity of language
The writing of definitions is a crucial point and, in general, very characteristic of this type of works. Since the first edition so we are very focused on this aspect. Defining words, both common and basic, as well as less common, more specialist or higher, with other simple and accessible words to a user with evolutionary language skills requires many choices and a well-defined writing plan.
From a lexical point of view, at first glance, it seemed natural to try to define the selected words using only ca. 7,000 entries in the Basic Vocabulary (VdB) by Tullio De Mauro. However, this method soon showed its limitations, especially when it came to defining technical-scientific voices or meanings. In addition, as has been shown in interviews on significant samples of teachers, teachers seek in a dictionary an educational tool that first allows them to increase the lexical skills of the pupils, as well as to strengthen those already possessed.
Hence the choice to use in the definitions a few words more than those of the VdB. Consistent with this decision, for example, in the exclusively synonymic definitions, typical of the adjectives where the use of periphrases often complicates and weighs the explanation of the meaning, triplets of words have been used, organized in a climax that proceeds from the word semantically closer to the lemma, but also from the most common to the highest. Unfortunately, the two criteria do not always coincide, so sometimes the word with the highest lexical complexity is also the first, being the closest of meaning.
Another example is provided by the demotics, a closed class of lemmas for which definitions are usually made of fixed formulas. Precisely because of their repetitiveness, these voices seemed to be the right ones to venture the use of an uncommon word as a native, inserted in the short definition to formulate ""Living, Native to...,"" counting also on the transparency of the native term, easily connected to born. Thus, in lemmas like Neapolitan we find short definitions, such as ""Abitante,"" native of Naples"" that introduce the user to a new word.
Then there is the problem of the syntactic complexity of definitions, which deserves preliminary consideration. The definitions of the terms of a dictionary obey precise rules (verbs defined with verbs, nouns with nouns, adjectives with adjectives or attributes, etc.): In addition, for reasons of space, definitory phrases are often elliptical; in the DJ the two most frequent cases of elliptical definitions are: (i) ""Inhabitant of Naples"" where the determinant is devoid of determination; (ii) in the intransitive verbs, it is often essential to specify who the potential subject is, using formulas such as ""By means of transport,"" to proceed.
Although attempts have been made to avoid the heavier elliptical formulas, it is clear that the syntactic complexity of these phrases is one of the thorniest issues to be addressed.
3.2 Keywords
Dictionaries designed for this target typically consist of a number of entries between a minimum of approx. 15,000, like the Basic Italian Dictionary by Tullio De Mauro (DIB), and a maximum of approx. 23/25,000, like the DJ. They are therefore extremely selective lexicographic repertoires, the result of very meditated choices.
In the case of the DJ, it started from ca. 7,000 voices of the VdB, which include 1,991 key words, approx. 2,750 of high use and additional 2,337 belonging to the high availability vocabulary. Thanks to this first nucleus, since the first edition of the DJ they were then lemmatized:
the most common derivatives of the 7,000 words not included in the VdB, so as to provide students with as full a range of voices as possible;
many synonyms or opposites, useful to place each lemma within a cognitive network of links that facilitate mutual understanding and storage;
the terms not included in the VdB, but necessary to define them without having to resort to complicated turn of words. As is known, in fact, a dictionary is a closed system, so each word used to define must in turn be defined within the work.
However, words such as noun, transitive or co-ordinated and subtraction, not included in the VdB, risked not to fall into the body of the DJ even following the other criteria identified. specialized and disciplinary terms as these could not fail to be present in a dictionary designed to be employed by primary and secondary school teachers of first degree. The identification of the sectoral terms suitable for this user by number and level of specialisation is therefore the real problem to be solved. During the first edition, the solution was found by taking stock of the manuals of the various subjects of the first grade secondary school accompanied by glossaries, a method that requires a considerable amount of resources and does not guarantee satisfactory results.
The role of the TAL in the revision of the DJ
In the design of the new version of the DJ, advanced TAL techniques have been used to support i) the control and possible reformulation of the definitions, and ii) the revision and eventual integration of the lemmary. The analyses were carried out on the entire corpus of dictionary data in XML format, for a total of more than 23,000 keywords to which more than 41,000 definitions are associated. As a preliminary step, the corpus of definitions was linguistically noted with LinguA (Dell'Orletta, 2009; Attardi and Dell'Orletta, 2009; Attardi et al., 2009). The levels of annotation at the base of the elaborations that follow are that morpho-syntactic and lemmatization, and syntactic dependent.
4.1 Analysis of definitions
The analysis of the definitions concerned two sides of linguistic complexity, lexical and syntactic. Through this type of analysis it was possible to identify which definitions contained terms and/or syntactic structures of difficult understanding.
The lexical complexity of the definition has been calculated according to the lexical complexity of the semantically full words used there, both in the form in which they actually appear, and in relation to the associated lemma. There are many factors that contribute to making a term complex, ranging from frequency, degree of ambiguity or abstractness, to length, to mention only a few (cf. Shardlow et al. (2021) for a review of the characteristics related to lexical complexity). Following Rayner and Duffy (1986), in this experiment we focused on the frequency factor.
The complexity of the terms within the definitions has been calculated by reference to a frequency dictionary organized in classes built from the corpus itWaC (Baroni et al., 2009), to date the most extensive corpus existing for Italian. The frequency class of each term has been calculated on the basis of the corpus using the following function:



where MFT is the most frequent term of corpus, CT is the term considered and freq is a function that associates with a term its absolute frequency in corpus (Richter et al., 2015). The classes of complexity have been defined in relation to the forms and the lemmas: there are 27 for the lemmas (0 to 26) and 26 for the forms (0 to 25). Starting from the assumption that common terms of use are considered simple while words rarely used are considered difficult, class 0 belongs to the most frequent and therefore more understandable terms (forms or lemmas), while classes 25 and 26 belong to the rarest and most difficult terms (form and lemmas respectively).
In addition to lexical complexity, a syntactic complexity score has been calculated for each definition, using READ-IT (Dell'Orletta et al., 2011), the first tool to evaluate the readability of texts in Italian based on TAL. READ-IT is based on a sophisticated analysis of the linguistic structures underlying the text and structured on different levels of linguistic description. To calculate the syntactic complexity READ-IT is based on a wide spectrum of linguistic traits (especially morpho-syntactic and syntactic derived from the linguistic annotation conducted in advance). The complexity is expressed with a value between 0 (simple) and 1 (difficult).
4.2 Review of the Keyword
The revision of the DJ's keyword was carried out through an internal verification to identify whether there were terms used in the definitions whose lemma was not defined in the dictionary, and a verification with respect to external resources. External resources have been used:
Tullio De Mauro's New Basic Vocabulary (NVdB), published in 2016, more than thirty years after the first version (1980), with the addition of approx. 1,000 words;
The keyword built automatically starting from the analysis of a corpus of texts for children selected within the school production Mondadori, which includes the entire curriculum of the Primary School flanked by the so-called parascholastic and narrative books.
If the update compared to the NVdB concerned the common vocabulary, the integration with respect to the list extracted from the school corpus Mondadori instead involved a sectoral terminological update, since the corpus, based on the production of the second cycle of the Primary School, includes books of reading and anthropological and scientific subsidiaries.
In the case of internal verification (with respect to the corpus of definitions) and external verification (with respect to the corpus of Mondadori scholastics) legariums were used built automatically starting from the morpho-syntactic annotation and legmatization. Comparing the list of the dictionary keywords and the reference keywords (VdB and those built automatically) it was possible to identify the keywords to be evaluated for possible insertion into the new DJ. This type of analysis led to the identification of more than 160 NVdB lemmas that were not part of the DJ's lemmary, and about 150 lemmas of words that recurred in the corpus of definitions but were not defined. More important is the number of terms derived from the analysis of the Mondadori school corpus, which obviously requires careful analysis aimed at discriminating the relevant sectoral terminology for a children's dictionary.
Processing: Some Examples
5.1 Vocabulary complexity
After associating the complexity classes with all full words, each definition was assigned 4 different lexical Complexity (CL) indicators concerning i) the CL of the most complex terms used there, and ii) the mean of the CL values of all full words within the definition. In both cases, the value of CL was calculated in relation to both form and lemma.
Table 1 exemplifies the CL indicators associated with certain definitions. The values associated with Max CLf/l allow to identify definitions in which particularly difficult terms appear (CLf concerns the forms and CLl the lemmas) of which a possible substitution with simpler terms must be evaluated. On the other hand, the values associated with Media CLf/l provide an overall measure of the lexical complexity of the single definition, calculated as the average of the complexity classes of all full words of the definition. The last two columns of the table explain the shape/lemma corresponding to the Max CLf/l value: it is interesting to note that the most difficult shape and lemma values can refer to different terms (see below). definition of the antipathy lemma).
This type of analysis identified definitions with a high degree of CL requiring revision. For example, in the definition of horde the word ""scalmanate"" with CL=19, has been replaced by the word ""agitate"" (CL=14), thus making the definition more understandable. In the case of a synonymic definition such as that of shade, it was found that the classes associated with ""offending"" and ""resenting"" belong to the class of complexity 14, while ""disappearing"" is class 20. The synonym associated with the highest class of CL was then relegated to the last position after the most usual ones, respecting the expected climax.
There are also cases where the lexicographer considered it appropriate not to intervene for several orders of reasons. For example, because the definition contained non-replaceable technicalities, despite a high degree of difficulty in understanding, as in the case of the definition of ovulation shown in the table.

Table 1: Indicators of lexical complexity associated with each definition

Table 2 shows, for each grammar category, the averages of the 4 CL scores associated with each definition. Conjunctions and adverbs appear to be the grammatical categories whose definitions are altogether simpler. Names, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, articles and interjections are characterized by more complex definitions.

Table 2: Average CL by grammar category

5.2 Syntactic complexity
Thanks to the READ-IT scores awarded for the syntactic level, it was possible to identify recurring constructions of difficult understanding. In this preliminary study, READ-IT was used in its current version, trained on journalistic texts, so the scores assigned to definitions should be considered as indicative, but not specialized with respect to the peculiarities of the language of the definitions. Nevertheless, it was possible to identify definitions containing complex constructions to be evaluated for possible simplified rewording, e.g. those introduced by prepositional syntagms that limit its domain or meaning. For example, the definition of going by means of transport has associated a syntactic complexity index (CS) of 0.36 which has significantly reduced by transforming it into a means of transport, proceed by means of transport (CS=0.04). Another example is the definitions of demotics as Canadian whose definition has changed from the elliptical form of Canada to the form of Canada.","In a dictionary of the language of use the speaker must be able to reflect himself, because he is at the same time the source and the recipient of the work. If this is true for any dictionary, it is even more so for those aimed at the market of the Primary School, in which everything must be child-friendly: the size of the volume and the price, because the Primary is the school of obligation par excellence, the level of complexity of the language, which must be proportionate to the knowledge and needs of children and their teachers. Since the requirements are so particular, the use of efficient production techniques in a work such as the DJ is therefore essential. TAL technologies have responded perfectly to this demand for efficiency. The verification of the existing keyword through the removal of large corporations targeted on the target, the classification of the lexical and syntactic complexity of the definitions identified through the use of an instrument such as READ-IT, the identification of the new entries to be inserted thanks to the cross-use of all these techniques have produced in short time certain and reliable results. Above all they have allowed the lexicographer to work on circumscribed and hierarchicalized objectives, reconciling the perspective of accessibility with that of the informativeness of the work. The work alongside editors and researchers has also opened up new areas of experimentation and reflection, such as the search for new definitory models, more accessible than traditional ones.
Bruno Migliorini, now many decades ago, closed his clear prose on the vocabulary with a distrusted statement: ""On the future of Italian lexicography it is not possible to make omens."" Today, thanks to experiments like this, we are able to say something more: the TAL cannot but be part of this future.

Domain and language shift are still major bottlenecks for a vast range of task-oriented dialogue systems. This paper focuses on data-driven models for dialogue state tracking, and builds on top of recent work on dialogue domain adaptation, showing that state-of-the-art models are very sensible to language shift obtained through automatic translation. Experiments show that combining training data for the two languages (English and Italian) is always beneficial, while combining domains does not increase performance. As a relevant side effect of our work, we present a new dataset for dialogue state tracking available for Italian, derived from MultiWOZ 2.3.","This paper[Copyright ©️2021 for this paper by its authors. Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).] is mainly motivated by the interest of exploring, and improving, the capacity of current data-driven task-oriented conversational systems to address shifts of domain and changes of language. Our starting point is the dialogue domain adaptation (DDA) approach proposed by 
<cit.>, which allows to adapt training dialogues collected for a source domain knowledge (e.g., restaurants in Cambridge) to a domain where certain changes (e.g., a new restaurant opens, a restaurants changes its food , etc.) have occurred. The idea behind DDA is, that, rather then trying to improve the model robustness, it is worth to generate new training dialogues that are consistent with the domain changes.
In this paper we extend and experiment DDA, so that also changes of language are included, particularly moving from English to Italian. 

A further motivation for our work is related to the scarcity of annotated data for task-oriented dialogues systems for the Italian language. 
Among the dialogic resources originally collected in Italian, we mention the recent JILDA dataset <cit.> <cit.>, a corpus of dialogues in the domain of job offers, semantically annotated. NESPOLE <cit.> is a corpus of human-human dialogues, which is not annotated for training purposes. The LUNA dataset <cit.>, although annotated with frame information, is not publicly available. Finally, the SUGAR dataset was presented at Evalita 2018 <cit.> allowing to train systems able to interpret spoken commands in Italian for the preparation of recipes.

 Example of dialogue domain and language adaptation. Words in bold indicate slot-values that have been adapted.
 


A second type of data is derived through automatic translation from English. This is the case of the Italian version of the SNIPS dataset <cit.>, which provides annotations for spoken language understanding and can be used for slot filling and intent detection. Similarly, an Italian version of the SQuAD question-answer pair corpus is available <cit.> for Italian through translation. It has to be remarked that the Italian translations of both SNIPS and SQuAD do not rely on task-oriented dialogues, rather just on question-answer pairs. In addition, they are produced through simple translation from English, i.e., preserving domain information (e.g., names of places, restaurants, hotels, etc. reflect the English domain). We also notice that, unfortunately, the recent MultiATIS++ dataset <cit.>, does not include Italian among the languages.

We are particularly interested in data-driven approach of dialogue state tracking (DST) <cit.> for the Italian language. DST captures the capacity of a model to predict the correct dialogue state at each turn in a dialogue, representing both the communicative goals (dialogue acts) of the user and the portion of domain knowledge involved in such goals (slot-value pairs).
To the best of our knowledge, the only dataset in Italian that can be used to model dialogue state tracking is JILDA <cit.>, where dialogue state annotations were carried on following the MultiWOZ style. However, being concluded very recently, still there are no available DST baselines for JILDA, and, for this reason, we have developed an Italian version of the MultiWOZ dataset <cit.>.

Starting from MultiWOZ 2.3, a popular dataset in English developed for booking traveling facilities (e.g., restaurants, hotels, trains, attractions) in the area of Cambridge, we incrementally operated both language and domain shifts. We provide three experimental configurations: (i) a translation of the Cambridge data set into Italian; (ii) a domain shift from Cambridge to Pisa, maintaining English as language; and, finally, (3) a configuration where both the initial domain and the language are changed. As a relevant side effect, the datasets for the three configurations are now available for further research on dialogue state tracking for Italian[https://github.com/tLabruna/DDA].

In the paper we first introduce the relavant background in dialogue domain adaptation (Section 2), then we explain how dialogue domain adaptation is concretely applied to domain changes, and finally we report the experiments we have conducted (Section 4 and 5).","We have investigated domain and language shift for data-driven task-oriented dialogue systems. We have extended recent work on dialogue domain adaptation to a cross-language setting, where both the domain and the language are changed. We showed that: (i) state-of-the-art models are very sensible to language shift obtained through automatic translation; (ii) combining training data for the two languages is always beneficial; on the contrary, combining data of different domains does not produce any improvement in all of our settings. Finally, as a relevant side effect of our work, we present a new dataset for dialogue state tracking available for Italian, derived from MultiWOZ 2.3. All the data are made available for further research on dialogue domain adaptation.

Crossword clues represent an extremely challenging form of Question Answering, due to their intentional ambiguity. Databases of previously answered clues are a vital source for the retrieval of candidate answers lists in Automatic Crossword Puzzles (CPs) resolution systems.


In this paper, we exploit language neural representations for the retrieval and ranking of crossword clues and answers.
We assess the performances of several embedding models, both static and contextual, on Italian and English CPs. Results indicate that embeddings usually outperform the baseline. Moreover, the use of embeddings for retrieval allows different ranking strategies, which turned out to be complementary, and lead to better results when used in combination.","Crossword Puzzles (CPs) resolution is a popular game. As almost any other human game, it is possible to tackle the problem automatically. CPs solvers frame it into a constraint satisfaction task, where the goal is to maximize the probability of filling the grid with answers consistent with their clues and coherent to the puzzle scheme. 

These systems <cit.> heavily rely on lists of candidate answers 
for each clue. Candidates' quality is crucial to CPs resolution. If the correct answer is not present in the candidates' list, the Crossword Puzzle cannot be solved correctly. Moreover, even a poorly ranked correct answer can lead to a failure in the 
crossword puzzle filling. Answers lists can come from multiple solvers, where each solver is typically specialized in solving different kinds of clues, and/or exploits different source of information.

Such lists are mainly retrieved with two techniques: (1) by querying the web with search engines using clue representations; (2) interrogating clue-answer databases that contain previously answered clues.
In this work, we focus on the latter.


In the problem of candidate answers retrieval from clue-answer knowledge sources, answers are ranked according to the similarity between a query clue and the clues in the DB. The similarity is provided by the search engine that assigns a score to each retrieved answer. Several approaches have been carried out to re-rank the candidates' list by means of learning to rank strategies <cit.>. These approaches require a training phase to learn how to rank and mostly differ for the re-ranking model or strategy adopted.
In particular, pre-trained distributed representations and neural networks are used for re-ranking clues in <cit.>.



The re-ranking of answer candidates attempts to improve the quality of candidates' lists, assuming that the correct answer belongs to the list. Differently from previous work, we aim at directly retrieving richer lists of answer candidates from a clue-answer database. In order to do so, we exploit both static and contextual distributed representations to perform a semantic search on the DB. An embedding-based search extends the retrieval to semantically related clues that may be phrased differently. Moreover, it also allows us to map in the same space questions and answers, which opens the way for ranking answers directly based on their similarity with respect to the query clue. Our approach requires no training on CPs data and it can be applied with any pre-trained embedding model.


In summary, the contributions of this work are: (1) a semantic search approach to candidate answer retrieval in automatic crossword resolution; (2) two complementary retrieval methodologies (namely QC and QA) detecting candidate answers that when combined together (even naively) produce a better set of candidates; (3) a comparison between different pre-trained language representations (either static or contextual).



The paper is organized as follows. First, we describe in Section <ref> distributed representations of language. In Section <ref>, we present the two answer retrieval approaches proposed in this work. Then, in Section <ref> we outline the experiments in detail, and discuss the obtained results. Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section <ref>.","In this paper, we proposed two different semantic search strategies (QC and QA) for ranking and retrieving answer candidates to CPs clues. We exploited pre-trained state-of-the-art embeddings, both static and contextual, to rank clue-answer pairs from databases. Embedding-based retrieval overcomes some of the limitations of inverted indices models, leading to higher coverage ranks, and allowing similar answers retrieval (QA). Finally, we observed that, even a simple ensembling that combines QC and QA, is effective and improves overall retrieval performances. 

This opens further research directions, where learning to rank methods could be exploited in order to better combine candidate answer lists from complementary approaches like QC and QA.",1,Language Models

The Italian spokesperson for communication regarding the pandemic has been, during the year 2020, the former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. We retrieved 4,860,395 comments from his Facebook official page and built the ConteCorpus, a new Italian resource annotated in CoNLL-U format. A first aim of the research was to evaluate the performance of the model used to annotate the corpus. Models trained on social media texts are usually not very generalizable. Nevertheless, the results of the evaluation were good, especially in parsing metrics, and showed that a parser trained on Twitter data can be successfully applied to Facebook data. A second aim of the research was to provide an overall view of the content of such a large corpus; for this purpose, topic modeling was conducted, training an LDA model. The model generated 5 topics that cover different aspects linked to the pandemic emergency, from economic to political issues. Through the topic modeling we investigated which topics are prevalent on particular days.","During the year 2020, the Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has played a major role in institutional communication, particularly in communication regarding the policies undertaken to manage the health emergency. We assumed that interesting content from the point of view of the response of the population to institutional communications regarding the pandemic would have been found on his social media profiles. Therefore, we created ConteCorpus, retrieving more than 4 million comments from his Facebook page starting from January 2020 until December 2020, and we annotated it in CoNLL-U format.
A first aim of the research was to evaluate the performance of the model used to annotate the dataset. Models trained on social media texts usually are poorly generalizable even on text retrieved from the same social media, therefore we wanted to test the performance on Facebook texts of a model trained on Twitter texts. In order to evaluate the model, we created a gold standard by extracting 1,000 sentences from the ConteCorpus and manually revising them.
A second aim of the research was to provide an overall view of this large corpus. For this purpose we performed a Topic Modeling. We trained a LDA model sampling 10% of the ConteCorpus. The LDA model generated 5 topics related to different aspects of the pandemic emergency. The model was used to see which topics were the most relevant before and after the announcement of the first and the second period of restrictions adopted to fight the pandemic in Italy.
The paper is structured as follows: we first review the relevant literature for our research (section 2), then we describe the data collection and the creation of the corpus (section 3). In section 4, we describe the evaluation we performed of the model we used to annotate the corpus in CoNLL-U format, and in section 5 we report the results of the topic modeling experiment. In section 6 we provide some concluding observations.
State of the Art
Since the beginning of the health emergency, there has been a proliferation of computational analyses that exploit data extracted from social media. These data are considered relevant as they allow us to generalize about human social and lin-
guistic behavior, especially regarding the pandemic event. Among the tasks that have been conducted on data drawn from social media in this period, sentiment analysis, emotion profiling and topic modeling are the most common (Gagliardi et al., 2020; Tamburini, 2020; Vitale et al., 2020; Stella et al., 2020a; Stella et al., 2020b; Stella et al., 2021; De Santis et al., 2020; Sciandra, 2020; Trevisan et al., 2021; Gozzi et al., 2020; Kruspe et al., 2020; Hussain et al., 2021; Chakraborty et al., 2020; Nemes e Kiss, 2020; Jelodar et al., 2021; Lamsal, 2020; Duong et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2021; Sullivan et al., 2021; Su et al., 2020; Garcia et Berton, 2021; Ahmed et al., 2020).
In particular, Topic Modeling aims at finding hidden semantic structures within the texts and to model them into concepts. The unsupervised clustering technique LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), developed by Blei (2003), has been used extensively in analyses conducted on social media data during the pandemic (Dashtian et Murthy, 2021; Feng et Zhou, 2020; Ordun et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Kabir et Mandria, 2020; Amara et al., 2020; Abd-Alzaraq et al., 2020; Naseem et al., 2021; Low et al. 2020, Andreadis et al., 2021). LDA is a statistical model that represents each document in a corpus as a probabilistic distribution over latent topics and each topic as a probabilistic distribution over words. A topic has a probability of generating various words, where the words are all the observed words in the corpus. Thus, the terms in the set of documents are used to discover hidden topics in a large corpus.
As is well known, the language of the web is characterized by deviation from the standard language that challenges the use of NLP tools. Several classifications have been proposed to label the nature of web and social media language. In general, the labels aim to define a variety of language that is diaphasically low and at an indefinite point on the diamesic axis, e.g., “netspeak” (Crystal, 2001). Web and social media language is characterized by little planning in text structure and a greater propensity for parataxis, absence of revision and punctuation, abrupt interruption of periods, and an imitation of the continuous flow of speech (Fiorentino, 2013). Although some persistent traits of web and social media language can be described, it does not constitute a single variety of language from a sociolinguistic perspective (Fiorentino, 2013). This poses a double challenge in the use of NLP tools. First, because the tools are calibrated to standard language variety resources. Secondly, even if we created models that are better suited to web and social media languages, they would not be generalizable to every language variety on the web (Sanguinetti et al., 2018).
ConteCorpus Construction
Data collection
We have downloaded 4,860,395 comments and 534 posts published during the year 2020 on Giuseppe Conte’s Facebook official profile. We made call to any 2020 post ID of Giuseppe Conte’s official page to retrieve text, object id, and created time of comments. The calls to the Facebook API Graph were made month to month in the same fashion. Nevertheless, as Table 1 shows, a larger amount of data has been retrieved in the month of March, April, and October. In the same period in Italy the more restrictive measures to fight pandemic were taken by the government.
Processing with the Neural Pipeline Stanza
After the data collection, we processed the data with the Neural Pipeline Stanza to enrich the texts with some annotations. Stanza is an open-source Python NLP toolkit, which “features a language-agnostic fully neural pipeline for text analysis, including tokenization, multiword token expansion, lemmatization, part-of-speech and morphological feature tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity” (Qi et al., 2020). The kit supports more than 77 human languages and uses the formalism Universal Dependencies Knowing the difficulties of annotating non standard texts such as those derived from social media, we chose to use this pipeline because the evaluation of its models found that Stanza neural language agnostic architecture “adapts well to text of different genres […] achieving state-of-the-art or competitive performance at each step of the pipeline” (Qi et al., 2020). Moreover, models that can be downloaded from Stanza have been trained each on a single language and on a specific text genre dataset. We chose to download the model trained on PoSTWITA-UD. PoSTWITA-UD is an Italian Twitter treebank in Universal Dependencies (Sanguinetti et al., 2018). Although the language of social media is very peculiar and changes from one social media to another and from groups to groups (Fiorentino, 2013), we thought that the model downloadable from Stanza - trained on this dataset - could be generalizable to our data, being in-domain. Moreover, Sanguinetti et al. (2018) have added customized tags to the UD scheme to deal with some social media peculiar phenomena: “discourse:emo” for emojis and emoticons, and “parataxis:hashtag” for hashtags. They tagged the link found in some sentences as “dep” (unspecified relation) and used the “upos” (universal part-of-speech) tag “SYM” (symbol) for hashtags and emojis. Additionally, they manually inserted the lemma of non-standard word forms not recognized by the lemmatizer (Sanguinetti et al., 2018).
We processed the data divided in 12 packages; each correspond to one month data. We used every processor of the pipeline, besides the Named Entity Recognition module (TokenizeProcessor, POSProcessor, LemmaProcessor, DepparseProcessor). We personalized the model in order not to split the sentences, forcing the TokenizeProcessor to consider each comment as a sentence. Furthermore, we added two metadata to
each sentence: one refers to the id of the post from which the comment was retrieved, and the other is the creation time of the comment. The aim is to make it easier to retrieve the comments from the corpus by their created time or post id if one needs to analyze a particular period of time or a particular post.
End-to-End Evaluation
Construction of the Gold Standard
We built a gold standard with a dual purpose: to evaluate the performance of the model on this new collection of social media texts, and to create a standard that can be used for future training and testing. We randomly selected 83 sentences from each file of the corpus annotated automatically (one file is composed of one-month comments), and manually revised the 1,000 sentences collected. The manual revision has followed the principle that what is understandable by a human would be correct.
Evaluation with CoNLL 2018 UD Shared Task Official Evaluation Script
To perform the evaluation, we used CoNLL 2018 UD shared task official evaluation script. Table 2 shows the scores of evaluation metrics resulting from the performance of Stanza model on the test set of the ConteCorpus. Table 3 compares the scores of evaluation metrics resulting from the performance of Stanza model on the test set of PoSTWITA-UD and the ConteCorpus. The first two columns are the scores on metrics that evaluate segmentation. The row called UPOS shows the resulting scores on Universal part-of-speech tagging metric, XPOS on language-specific part-of-speech tagging metric, and UFeats on morphological features tagging metric. The last 5 rows show scores in five different parsing metrics.
What we found most challenging during the manual revision of the 1,000 sentences annotated automatically was correcting the errors in tokenization: many words that the tokenizer should have splitted were joined together. This type of tokenization error is often found when punctuation is used with non standard function. For example: we found that the token “oneste…volevo” (“honest…I wanted to”) - an adjective, a punctuation mark and a verb - are conflated in a single token. In the manual revision, tokens like this have been splitted in three different tokens and other missing tags were added. The presence of such conflated words mayhave caused a worse score in the metric that evaluates the performance of segmentation, and consequentially in the other scores. The evaluation on the parser starts with aligning system nodes and gold nodes; their respective parent nodes are also considered; if the system parent is not aligned with the gold parent or if the relation label differs, the word is not counted as correctly attached. Despite errors in segmentation seem frequent in the corpus, this did not cause an excessive lowering of the scores on the various metrics reported in Table 2 and 3. Another error that appears frequently regards the lemma assigned to the abbreviations that are not present in PoSTTWITA-UD. Canonical abbreviations are tagged correctly, for example “cmq” for “comunque” (“however”). The abbreviations tagged incorrectly are those which appeared few times: such as “ql” that stands for “quelli” (those). An unexpected good result has been achieved on parsing metrics. This result could be due to the “preference of UD scheme in assigning headedness to content words” (Sanguinetti et al., 2018); therefore, the tendency of the social media languages to eliminate function words does not affect the performance of the parser. Another explanation can be found in the very similar frequencies distribution of part-of-speeches and syntactic relations in the training set and the gold standard, as shown in Figure 1 and 2.
Overall, the model trained on PoSTWITA-UD turned out to perform well on the test set of the ConteCorpus because PoSTWITA-UD tagset has been adapted with attention to some recurrent features of social media languages. Our evaluation showed that a model trained on texts retrieved by social media can adapt well to other social media texts if one pays attention to the neural architecture of the model and the annotation format being used.
Topic Modeling
To provide an overall view of the content of this large corpus we performed a Topic Modeling training and testing an LDA model on the ConteCorpus.
Methodology
To perform topic modelling, we sampled 10% of the sentences in our dataset and trained a LDA model. We treated each sentence as a document. We pre-processed lemmas removing stopwords, downloading Italian stopwords list from the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library and manually inserting missing stopwords. We filtered out tokens that appear in less than 15 documents and tokens with less than three letters; additionally, we kept only the 100,000 most frequent words. We transformed the documents into vectors creating a bag-of-words representation of each document. Then, we performed the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) on the whole corpus to assign higher weights to the most important words. Gensim LDA model was applied first to the bags-of-words and secondly on the TF-IDF corpus to extract latent topics. Better performances were achieved with the LDA model applied to bags-of-words. We determined the optimal number of topics in LDA using the Coherence Value metric. The underlying idea is that a good model will generate topics with high topic Coherence Value score. We ran different LDA experiments varying the number of topics and selected the model with the highest medium topic Coherence Value score. Our final model generated 5 topics and has a topic medium Coherence Value score of 0.5. Table 4 illustrates the top ten most representative terms associated with each detected topic.
Results
As expected, all the topics extracted from the corpus are related to the concerns about the emergency. The focus is on the economic aspect of the
emergency. The first ten most frequent words in Economics topic (Table 4 and Figure 3) are economic terms: “loan”, “company”, “to pay” “money” etc. In all the other topics at least one of the 10 most frequent words comes from the economic sphere. Among the ten most frequent words of each topic there are only two words regarding the pandemic, found in Pandemic topic: ""virus"" and ""pandemic"". It is no coincidence that the most frequent word in this topic is “to go out”. The need to face the emergency through the intervention of the institutions is evident. This is shown especially by Prime Minister and Politics topics (Table 4). Prime Minister topic most frequent words are related to the Prime Minister. Perhaps words like “bravo” and “thank you” and “dear” show a positive judgement towards him. In Politics topic one finds words of the institutional sphere such as: “country”, “government”, “people”, “bank”. Home topic is related to the private sphere with words like “to hope”, “home”, “to wait”, “to lose”, although there is no shortage of words from the economic sphere. In Figure 3 the distance between the centre of the circles indicates the similarity between the topics. Here you can see that only Economics topic and Prime Minister topic overlap; this indicates that the two topics are more similar with respect to the other topics. Moreover, the size of the area of each circle represents the importance of the topic relative to the corpus. Economics topic is the most important topic in the corpus. Finally, we tested our model on unseen documents: the comments published between 15 February and 30 March 2020, before and after the announcement of the first period of restrictions to combat the pandemic, and between 1 October and 14 November 2020, before and after the announcement of the second period of restrictions. Figures 4, 5 and 6 show trends in topics over time. Each line represents a topic and the x-axis shows the time progression. On 23 February, the first restrictive policies were announced for some Italian cities: Figure 5 shows a peak in the pandemic topic on that day. Figure 4 shows how the prevalence of the five topics changes on 8-12 March 2020. The Figure shows a peak on 9 March in Prime Minister topic: on that day he announced the first national restrictions period to combat the pandemic. Overall, the prevalent topics on those days are economics and pandemic. On 13 October, after a summer without major restrictions, with a new exponential increase in the curve of contagions, the Italian Parliament passed a decree limiting the possibility of aggregation. That day we have a new peak in the Pandemic theme (Figure 6). In the days that followed, the prevailing topic is Economics: on 28 October, the “ristoro” decree was approved to financially support commercial activities. A peak in the topic of Economics occurred on 18 March: on those days, discussions were taking place on whether to ask the European Union for financial aid to overcome the pandemic. The prevailing topics are therefore usually related to current events.","As mentioned before, models trained with data from social media are hardly generalizable. This stems from the fact that from a sociolinguistic perspective, the language of social media does not constitute a single variety. So, we expected that the results in the various evaluation metrics we performed would be worse than the results in the evaluation conducted on the PoSTWITA-UD test set. Surprisingly, in some metrics the results on evaluating the ConteCorpus test set were better than the results on the PoSTWITA-UD test set. To offer an overall view of the content of the ConteCorpus we performed topic modeling. The topics generated by the LDA model cover various aspects of the pandemic emergency, with a preponderance of political and economic issues. Unexpectedly, topics identified do not show concern regard the risk of contagion and the possibility of catching the disease.

The paper presents an Italian
question answering system over linked data. We use a model-based approach to question answering based on an ontology lexicon in lemon format. The system exploits an automatically generated lexicalized grammar that can then be used to interpret and transform questions into SPARQL queries. We apply the approach for the Italian language and implement a question answering system that can answer more than 1.6 million questions over the DBpedia knowledge graph.","As the amount of linked data published on the Web keeps increasing, there is an expanding demand for multilingual tools and user interfaces that simplify the access and browsing of data by end-users, so that information can be explored in an intuitive way. This need is what motivated the development of tools such as Question Answering (QA) systems, whose main aim is to make users be able to explore complex datasets and an ever growing amount of data in an intuitive way, through natural language.

While the default approach for many NLP tasks has recently been represented by machine learning systems, the use of such approaches <cit.> for QA over RDF data suffers from lack of controllability, making the governance and incremental improvement of the system challenging, not to mention the initial effort of collecting and providing training data for a specific language. 


An alternative is the so-called model-based approach to QA, in which a model is first used to specify how concepts and relations are realized in natural language, and then this specification is employed to interpret questions from users. One such system is the one proposed by <cit.>, which makes use of a lexicon in lemon format <cit.> to specify how the vocabulary elements of an ontology or knowledge graph (e.g., entities and relations from a Knowledge Graph) are realized in natural language.

The previous work on this approach shows how, leveraging on lemon lexica, question answering grammars can be automatically generated, and those can, in turn, be used to interpret questions and then parse them into SPARQL queries. A QA web application developed in previous work <cit.> has further shown that such QA systems can scale to large numbers of questions and that the performance of the system is practically real-time from an end-user perspective. 

In this work we describe the extension to the Italian language of the model-based approach described in <cit.> and the QA system described in <cit.>. By doing so, we develop a QA system that can answer more than 1.6 million Italian questions over the DBpedia knowledge graph[https://www.dbpedia.org/]. 

todo: this part has to be removed if we do no evaluationFurthermore, we present results showing that a large percentage of the Italian questions of the QALD-7 corpus <cit.> can be rephrased in terms of Italian questions that our grammar can cover. 



The approach and the system will be of interest to a wide community of researchers in the areas of Semantic Web, NLP, and especially for those working on Italian question answering. TODO: we can probably remove the previous sentence, unless the conference requires such a statement.
@Fazleh: changed accordingly","We presented an approach to developing Italian QA systems over linked data that relies on the automatic generation of grammars from corresponding lemon lexica describing how elements of the dataset are realized in natural language. The approach is controllable, since the introduction of a lexical entry increases the question coverage in a fully predictable way. Our proof-of-concept implementation over DBpedia covers 1.6 million questions generated from 249 lemon entries. 

In future work, we intend to further automatize grammar generation by using LexExMachina <cit.>, which induces lexicon entries bridging the gap between ontology and natural language from a corpus in an unsupervised manner.

The goal of the study was to implement a linguistically and cognitively-oriented procedure aimed at improvising the quality of use and understanding of TV contents for an audience of people suffering from cognitive disorders after a brain damage.
Tools for the automatic text analysis and psycholinguistic and neuropsychological methods have been explored in order to obtain simplified versions of original written texts from Italian TV news bulletins. An empirical pilot study on healthy people has been conducted where reading latitudes for original vs. simplified texts have been compared.

Italian. The aim of the work is to develop a cognitively and linguistically oriented procedure to improve the use of television content by people with cognitive disorders resulting from brain injuries. Through the integration of automatic linguistic analysis techniques and methods from psycholinguistics and neuropsychology, simplified versions of the texts used in Italian television news have been obtained. A pilot empirical study was conducted with healthy speakers in which the speed of reading of the original and simplified texts was evaluated.","In Italy and around the world an important part of the population survives for a long time traumatic and pathological events affecting the brain that affect cognitive abilities in a more or less serious way (Di Luca et al., 2011).
Progress in social care and policies gives people with brain injuries a good life expectancy and adequate general health conditions.
However, the quality of life is not comparable to the period prior to the onset of the disorder. One of the reasons that affects the long-term negative effects of a brain injury has to do with reducing the ability of people to stay focused on the socio-cultural reality in which they live, for example, by updating themselves through the media (Cartwright & Elliott, 2009; Denicolai, 2016).
Currently, RAI national networks, within the scope of public utility services, provide support for the visually impaired and visually impaired public (audio-description), for the deaf public (translations into Italian sign language (LIS) and subtitling) and other generic Stretch TV tools to adapt audio-video speed to the user's needs. However, there are no support services for the editions of the news (TG) specifically intended for people with cognitive damage. In addition, unlike the simplification of administrative, institutional and educational texts for multilingual people, or children with and without disabilities (see among others, De Mauro, 2021; Cortelazzo, 2015; Fortis, 2003), the data and guidelines on the adaptation of Italian-language information texts for adults with cognitive damage are less widespread (Piemontese, 1996; Dell'Orletta et al., 2014).
On the other hand, many studies indicate that the procedures of linguistic simplification, both manual and automatic, are a valuable aid for the use of textual content for different categories of linguistic and cognitive disorders (see Siddharthan, 2014 for a review).
In this scenario, this work proposes the integration of linguistic and psycholinguistic analysis tools as a possible strategy to implement procedures for simplifying the content of TGs in order to improve the experience of use by people with acquired brain damage.

Method

The research has been divided into several phases described in the following paragraphs.

Selection of original news texts

2 TGs were selected from RAI networks in September 2020: RAI One TG1 and RAI News 24.
Three editions were selected for each TG:
long evening edition (launch of the news in extended version);
short morning edition (launch of news in synthetic version);
version in LIS (launch of translated news).
18 news items have been selected, 3 for each edition of each magazine. News on politics (6), Covid-19 (1), economy (1), news (5), entertainment (1), current affairs (3) and sports (1) have been obtained. No topic of the news has been repeated.

Production of simplified news versions

The texts of the news have been subjected to two types of reworking (S1e S2) aimed at simplifying the text while maintaining the content aspects of the texts.
The selection of parameters to be manipulated in the simplification phase was based on evidence in the neuropsychological and psycholinguistic field on the processes of reading and understanding texts in people with acquired cognitive disorders (Alyahya et al., 2020; Body et al., 1999; Channon & Watts, 2003; Los, 2016; McDonald, 1992; Osterhout & Swinney, 1993; Zurif, & Swinney, 1994; Snow & Douglas, 2017; Turkstra & Politis, 2017).

Parameters manipulated to produce version S1

The simplification procedure for the creation of the S1 version involved formal, lexical and syntactical parameters. In particular, where possible:
long and low-frequency words have been replaced with shorter and higher-frequency synonyms or equivalent;
the number of subordinate propositions has been reduced;
the subject has been made explicit;
was favored the use of the active construction of the verb.

Parameters manipulated to produce the S2 version

In S2 the organization of the content aspects of the news has been modified and the lexical and syntactic simplifications of the previous intervention have been maintained. The aim was to make the focus of the news more prominent than marginal information. In particular:
the order of the information has been changed, both within the sentence and within the full text of the news;
the number of implicit connections between the different elements of the news has been reduced.
For an example of comparison between the original version of a news item and the S1 and S2 versions, see Table 1.


Table 1: Example of news text in the original version and S1 and S2 versions
2.3 Analysis of selected news

The original and simplified texts of the selected news have been subjected to two analysis procedures, a manual-psycholingual and an automatic-linguistic one.
The manually conducted psycholinguistic analysis has been oriented to obtain an objective description of the main variables influencing cognitive processes at the basis of linguistic elaboration: the frequency of use of words-content in the script (CoLFIS, Bertinetto et al., 2005) and in the spoken (VoLIP, De Mauro et al., 1993), the length of sentences, the number of main phrases and subordinate phrases (Table 2).

Table 2: Results of manual psycholinguistic analysis

The linguistic analysis was carried out with automatic tools (READ-IT, Dell""Orletta et al., 2011) to obtain specific indices related to the complexity and legibility of the texts. In particular, five indices were obtained: READ-IT base, READ-IT lexical, READ-IT syntactical, READ-IT global and GULPEASE (Table 3).


Table 3: Automatic analysis results
To assess the efficiency of the text reformulation process, automatic complexity metrics and the values of the psycholinguistic evaluations of the original and simplified versions of the texts were subjected to t-tests.
The results obtained are as follows:
The indices derived from manual psycholinguistic analysis did not reveal any significant differences between the three versions of the news.
On the contrary, considering the indices of automatic linguistic analysis, the original texts were more complex than S1 and S2 on all 5 indices considered.
Original vs. S1:
READ-IT base: t (17) = 3.45, p<.005;
Vocabulary READ-IT: t (17) = 2.26, p<.05;
Syntactical READ-IT: t (17) = 3.5, p<.01;
Global READ-IT: t (17) = 5.82, p<.001; GULPEASE: t (17) = -4.33, p<.001.
Original vs. S2:
READ-IT base: t (17) =4 .11, p<.001;
READ-IT lexical: t (17) = 2.03, p=.05;
Syntactical READ-IT: t (17) = 4.31, p<.001;
Global READ-IT: t (17) = 8.46, p<.001; GULPEASE: t (17) = -5.34, p<.001.
The S2 texts were simpler than the S1 texts only for the basic READ-IT indices (t (17) = 215, p<.05) and GULPEASE (t (17) = -5.08, p<.001).

Experimental-pilot verification based on the performance of healthy speakers

The original and simplified texts of the news were used in 2 experiments with healthy adult speakers: E1 and E2.
E1 was organized as a pilot experiment to verify the impact on the reading of the S1 and S2 simplifications compared to the original version.
Reading times have been recorded and the retention/understanding of the news has been evaluated through an application for verification of the true/false type.
E2 was intended to obtain information on further potential factors relevant to the reading and understanding processes of texts beyond the control of the manual and automatic analysis tools already used. In particular, in E2 three aspects of the texts of the news used as stimuli in E1 were analyzed:
The complexity of the topic of the news.
It is plausible to assume that aspects related to the specific semantic content of an economic, sporting or foreign policy theme require the use of terms that cannot be simplified or, also, that the theme itself is more or less complex for the reader and therefore affects the speed of reading and/or the understanding of the news.
The level of difficulty in the linguistic formulation of the news.
It is known that automatic text analysis tools provide information on the readability and accessibility of the language of the message issuer. However, the difficulty perceived by the recipient may not be congruent with them. This could reveal useful elements for the analysis of reading and understanding processes.
The naturalness of the Italian language used in the writing of the news text.
It is possible that the transformations made on the text, although useful to improve its readability, can be artifacts and unnatural to the reader and influence its reading and understanding.

54 students from the University of Salerno (average age = 25 years) of native Italian language participated in the study.

Stimulations
The set of 54 news (18 original news, 18 S1, 18 S2) was divided into 3 lists to avoid repetition effects of the material. In each list, every piece of news was in one version. Each list consisted of 6 original news, 6 S1 and 6 S2. For each list 3 different news presentation orders were created to balance any fatigue and novelty effects of the task.
Participants were assigned to each list and presentation order randomly.

E1: Procedure
The reading task was performed by the participants in self-managed mode. Each participant received by mail two files implemented in Microsoft PowerPoint environment where the ability to record the time spent by the participant on the provisions in which the news text was transcribed was enabled (Font: Calibri; 28 points).
File 1 had the function of familiarizing with the procedure.
File 2 was the experimental file and was received by the participant only after verification of the correct execution of the familiarization phase. Participants were asked to read each news and answer a verification question with two (true or false) answer options.

E1: Results
The performance data of participants who provided a number of incorrect responses to the verification application above 1,5 standard deviations (DS) from the sample mean were excluded from the statistical analyses. The application of this criterion resulted in the exclusion of 5 participants. The overall reading times of the texts, the average reading times per word and the number of incorrect responses to the verification question showed no statistically significant differences in the comparison between the three versions of the news texts (Table 4).

* ms= milliseconds

Table 4: Reading times and errors for the three news versions

E2: Procedure
E2 was implemented on Google-Module. At least 7 days after taking part in E1, students enrolled received a Module containing one of the 3 lists of 18 selected news items. The list received for E2 was different from that received for E1.
For each news, participants were asked to make a judgment from 1 to 5 to assess:
the complexity of the news, that is, how difficult the topic of the news was to understand;
linguistic formulation, i.e. how difficult the language used to formulate the news text was to understand regardless of the content;
Naturality, that is, how much the language used to formulate the news corresponded to the way Italian speakers normally use the language to communicate in different contexts.

E2: Results
Unlike those observed for the automatic analysis of texts, the judgements of the speakers showed no significant differences between the different formulations of the news (Table 5).


Table 5: Results of subjective evaluations of speakers","This work has described the development and preliminary application of a method based on the integration of automatic linguistic analysis tools available in Italian with psycholinguistic tools and neuropsychological knowledge for the production of simplified versions of television news texts for people with cognitive-linguistic disorders.
The method used made it possible to respond to precise empirical needs. The texts of the news have the purpose of spreading with completeness of information the most disparate themes in a short and little redundant format. This places constraints on linguistic simplification: not all words can be replaced, nor can certain details of detail be omitted. In addition, the conceptual complexity of certain themes covered by the news may be independent of linguistic formulation. The proposed method has made it possible to work on multiple levels: the manipulation of linguistic parameters (S1) and the organization of content (S2, subjective assessments of the complexity of the content in E2); the analysis of the language of the issuer (manual psycholinguistic evaluations and automatic linguistic evaluations) and of the recipient (subjective evaluations of the speakers in E2).
The comparison between the measurements resulting from manual psycholinguistic analysis, subjective evaluations of speakers and the indices derived from automatic linguistic analysis were not consistent with each other. The automatic analysis tools proved to be more sensitive to the manipulation of the complexity of the texts than to the psycholinguistic analyses and subjective evaluations of the speakers. This results in emphasising the importance of integrating analytical methods into the design of simplification interventions.
The preliminary behavioral data (reading times and accuracy to the verification request) of the pilot-test with healthy participants showed a significant lack of impact of the automatic analysis indices related to readability and complexity of the reading performance texts.
Methodological reasons explain these results. Firstly, it should be borne in mind that the linguistic competence of the participants enrolled (young, healthy and well-schooled) has neutralised the effect of the level of complexity of the material presented. The data is, in fact, consistent with a study by Crossley et al. (2014) in which it has been verified that statistically significant differences in the reading speed of texts of different complexity are cancelled by the insertion of the level of competence of the reader as a covariate in the statistical analyses. On the other hand, it is not to be excluded that a replica of the study using an eye-tracker can reveal more detailed qualitative and quantitative aspects on the fluidity of the reading process in the three versions of the texts considered: for example, duration of fixations on certain portions of text, multiple fixations of specific portions of text, words skipped. Moreover, the brevity of the texts used has not allowed to investigate in depth fine aspects related to the understanding and retention of the material in which it is most likely to observe effects of textual simplification. The understanding was, in fact, marginally considered through a single question of verification. In this sense, it is important to stress that, at the same level of understanding of a text, the parameter that significantly distinguishes the performance of healthy readers compared to readers with cognitive disorders is the reading speed (Webster et al., 2018). This aspect will be evaluated at a later stage of the study in which the experimental procedure described here will be extended to people with cognitive damage resulting from brain lesions. To obtain more accurate measurements and to create a more suitable administration context for participants will be made a change to the experimental paradigm used as a reading task. A reading task will be implemented with the moving window technique (moving windows, Witzel et al., 2012). This paradigm allows the presentation of text word by word, or syntagma by syntagma. The progress from one text unit to the next is managed by the reader and allows the recording of the reading times for the individual units considered.

Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)] (FActivity, Negation, Common-sense, hYpernimy), a new dataset with 4000 sentence pairs concerning complex linguistic phenomena such as factivity, negation, common-sense knowledge, hypernymy and hyponymy. 
The analysis is developed on two levels: coarse-grained for the labels of the Natural Language Inference (NLI), that is to say the task of determining whether a hypothesis is true (entailment), false (contradiction), or undetermined (neutral) and fine-grained for the linguistic features of each phenomenon. 
For our experiments, we analyzed the quality of the sentence embeddings generated from two transformer-based neural models, BERT <cit.> and RoBERTa <cit.>, that were fine-tuned on MNLI and were tested on our dataset, using CBOW as a baseline. The results obtained are lower than the performance of the same models on benchmarks like GLUE <cit.> and SuperGLUE <cit.> and allow us to understand which linguistic features are the most difficult to understand.","Nowadays it has become more and more important to understand how much neural models applied to Natural Language Processing can understand about language features. 

The probing task methodology is a simple but effective approach to address this issue <cit.>.
A network is trained on a specific task and then the representations are passed to a classifier. The performance of the classifier is evaluated with a dataset constructed to test the understanding of specific linguistic phenomena. If the classifier performs well, then it can be deduced that the neural embeddings have stored syntactic and semantic knowledge relative to those specific linguisitc phenomena. 

One of the most widely used tasks for this approach is Natural Language Inference, in which the model must decide whether a hypothesis is an entailment, a contradiction, or simply neutral with respect to the premise. 

Another approach consists in using benchmarks, i.e. datasets relating to various types of tasks, which are able, on the basis of the results obtained, to provide a general judgment on the performance of the model. Although benchmarks are very useful in evaluating the average performance of models, they are less effective in representing a wide range of linguistic phenomena that the models are able to deal with. 

It is in this context that the challenge sets are born, (also called adversarial sets, stress sets or diagnostic sets) such as the SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference) <cit.> and the MultiNLI (Multi-genre Natural
Language Inference) <cit.>. This datasets provide the possibility of more specific evaluation frameworks compared to traditional benchmarks <cit.>: as in the case of the probing task, the aim is to evaluate the quality of linguistic information encoded by vector representations. 

For our research we built a diagnostic dataset that addresses key aspects of the human knowledge of lexical and compositional meaning, in order to test the deep semantic abilities of the latest computational models. 

In this paper, we introduce FANCY, a dataset with 4,000 different hand-annotated sentence pairs with inference relation between them. In Section <ref> we will briefly present the linguistic phenomena we decided to analyze. In Section <ref> we will present the methods of dataset construction and in Section <ref> we will discuss the results of the experiments conducted on FANCY.","Following a large number of recent studies <cit.>, <cit.>, <cit.>, <cit.>, we also tried to investigate whether the latest neural models were able to understand certain linguistic phenomena. On the one hand, we wanted to test the models on the real understanding of the English language, on the other hand, we wanted to build a fine-grained dataset, which allows a detailed analysis of each phenomenon. We tested two of the the most high-performance models such as BERT and RoBERTa and we observed how they struggle dealing with linguistic features that are quite simple to understand for a human being. 

We have shown how the models can better handle phenomena such as factivity and negation if compared with the results obtained on hierarchical relation and common-sense knowledge. More in particular, we were able to stress how the state-of-the-art models struggle in dealing with linguistic phenomena that are essential for a correct understanding of the language such as the possibility generated by a statement, temporal relations between entities, the negation when there is a presence of temporal adverbs and relative pronouns and cases of downward monotone sentences. 
In future developments of our work we could use FANCY in order to perform fine tuning on Transformer-based models with the aim of increasing model performance and inferential capabilities. To do this it would be useful to produce more data, possibly annotated by different people, to test the models developed on different types of natural language. At the same time, the dataset could be implemented with other languages, such as Italian.

Such collections have an established ground truth
and are relatively easy to construct across languages.
As a result, we introduce a corpus that includes diachronic and normal articles from Greek newspapers and news websites. On top of that, we build a rich linguistic feature set, and analyze and compare its deception cues with the only collection currently available, which is in English. 
Following a current research thread, we also discuss the individualism/collectivism dimension in deception with respect to these two datasets.
Lastly, we build classifiers by testing various monolingual and crosslingual settings. The results showcase that datasets can be helpful in deception detection studies,
and are in alignment with the observations of other deception detection works.","(for short ) is a long standing custom,
mostly in Western societies. It is the only day of the year when practical jokes and deception are expected. This is the case for all social interactions, including journalism, which is generally considered to aim at the presentation of truth. Every year on this day, newspapers and news websites take part in an unofficial competition to invent the most believable, but untrue story. In this respect, news articles fall into the deception spectrum, as they satisfy widely acceptable definitions of deception as in Masip et al. Masip2005Deception.



The massive participation of news media in this custom

establishes a rich corpus of deceptive articles from a diversity of sources. 


Although articles may exploit common linguistic instruments with satire news, like exaggeration, humour, irony and paralogism, they are usually considered a distinct category. This is mainly due to the fact that they also employ other mechanisms which characterize deception in general, like sophisms, and changes in cognitive load and emotions <cit.> to deceive their audience.
 articles are often believable, and there exist cases where sophisticated articles have been reproduced by major international news agencies worldwide[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/150331-april-fools-day-hoax-prank-history-holiday].

This motivated us to extend our previous work on linguistic cues of deception 
and their relation to the cultural dimension of individualism and collectivism
<cit.>, in the context of the . That work examines if differences in the usage of linguistic cues of deception (e.g., pronouns) across cultures can be identified and attributed to the individualism/collectivism divide.

Specifically, the contributions of this work are:

 * A new corpus that includes diachronic and normal articles from Greek newspapers and news websites[The collection is available in: <https://gitlab.isl.ics.forth.gr/papanton/elaprilfoolcorpus>], adding one more collection to the currently unique one in English <cit.>.
 
 * A study and discussion of the linguistic cues of deception that prevail in the Greek and English collection, along with their similarities.
 
 * A discussion on whether the consideration of the individualism/collectivism cultural dimension in the context of aligns with the results of our previous work.
 
 * An examination of the performance of various classifiers in identifying articles, including multilanguage setups.","We introduced a new dataset with news articles in Greek and
analyzed and compared its deception cues with another English one.
The results showcased the use of emotional language, especially of positive sentiment, 
for deceptive articles which is even more prevalent in the individualistic English dataset.
Further, deceptive articles use less concrete language, as manifested by the increased use of adverbs, hedges, and boosters 
and less usage of named entities, spatial related words and conjunctions compared to the truthful ones.
The future and past tenses were correlated with deceptive and truthful articles respectively. 
All the above, mainly align with previous work <cit.>, except from some differences in the usage of pronouns for the Greek dataset, 
which is attributed to the idiosyncrasies of the news domain.
The accuracy of the deployed classifiers offered adequate performance,
with no statistically significant differences between the best logistic regression and the BERT models.

a novel adaptation to small treebanks of a methodology for identifying cross-lingual quantitative trends in the distribution of dependency relations. 
By relying on the principles of cross-validation, 
we reduce the amount of data required to execute the method, paving the way to expanding its use to low-resources languages. We validated the approach on 8 small treebanks, each containing less than 100,000 tokens and representing typologically different languages. We also show preliminary but promising evidence on the use of the proposed methodology for treebank expansion.","Linguistically-annotated language resources like treebanks are fundamental for developing reliable models to train and test tools used to address Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks acquiring linguistic evidence from corpora. Concerning the latter, 
researchers frequently rely on multilingual or parallel resources in contrastive studies to quantify the similarities and differences between languages <cit.>. Over the past few years, the Universal Dependencies (UD) initiative[<https://universaldependencies.org>] <cit.> has further encouraged such studies. UD defines a universal inventory of categories and guidelines to facilitate consistent annotation of similar constructions across languages <cit.>, and, at present, the project includes about 200 treebanks representing over 100 languages. The consistent annotation of linguistic phenomena under a shared representation and across different languages makes UD treebanks exceptionally well suited for quantitative comparison of languages (see, for example, croft2017linguistic, berdicevskis2018using, vylomova2020proceedings and among our works, alzetta2019inferring and alzetta2020quantitative). 


Despite their great relevance for linguistic investigations, large treebanks are available for only a tiny fraction of the world's languages <cit.>. Even within the UD project, around 60% of the treebanks can be considered small, i.e. containing less than 100,000 tokens. Treebank size, in fact, is generally identified as the bottleneck for obtaining high-quality representative models of language use to be employed in downstream NLP applications. In general terms, larger datasets allow for better generalisations of language constructions, leading to better performances of systems trained using such data <cit.>. In fact, ad-hoc strategies are generally needed when dealing with low-resourced languages <cit.>. 


This paper illustrates a novel workflow specifically designed to adapt an existing methodology for treebank exploration to small treebanks. 

The base method, extensively described by alzetta2020linguistically, relies on an unsupervised algorithm called LISCA (LInguistically–driven Selection of Correct Arcs) <cit.>.
LISCA has been successfully employed in past works for performing quantitative cross-lingual analyses <cit.> and error detection on UD treebanks <cit.>. The algorithm works in two main steps. First, it acquires evidence about language use from the distributions of phenomena in annotated sentences. The algorithm 

then uses such evidence to distinguish typical from atypical constructions in an unseen set of sentences. The typicality of a construction is determined with respect to the examples observed in a corpus used as a reference, and is encoded with a score. This score, in fact, reflects the probability of observing a dependency occurring in a given context (both sentence-level and corpus-level) on the basis of the constructions sharing common properties reported in the reference corpus. Hence, from our point of view, typicality and frequency are tightly related concepts, as non-standard constructions are also usually less frequent in natural language use. 

As such, the LISCA methodology relies on large sets of automatically parsed sentences to collect the statistics about phenomena distributions: even if the data contains parsing errors[An assumption when producing automatically parsed data is that most of the errors made by a parser are consistent. As we showed in <cit.>, the LISCA-based method allows to spot these errors types in annotations.], the corpus size guarantees the collected statistics reflect the actual language use. 
However, such an approach can be employed only for analysing languages for which large amounts of data are available, or at least for which the parser outputs are generally considered reliable.

To overcome such a limit, aaggarwalthesis suggested that if the statistics are acquired from gold annotations (such as treebanks), the algorithm could collect the statistics from fewer data since these resources are assumed to be error-free. 


We implemented this proposal by adapting the original LISCA workflow as detailed in Section <ref>. Our variation to the original methodology is inspired by the k-fold approach commonly used for performing systems' cross-validation: according to this approach, a dataset is split into sub-sets of equal size, iteratively used for training and/or evaluating a system. We employ a similar strategy for evaluating the typicality of the dependency relations in each treebank split, acquiring the statistics from the sentences contained in the other splits rather than from an external reference corpus. This small but substantial change in the method workflow allows us to apply the LISCA algorithm to small treebanks, which is particularly relevant in the case of analyses performed on low-resource languages. 

We tested the methodology in a case study, reported in Section <ref>, involving 8 languages represented using UD treebanks. Our goal is to test if our method can support linguistic investigations for exploring and quantifying similarities and differences between 
typologically different languages. To this aim, we first validate the adaptation to the original LISCA approach proposed here in Section <ref>. Then, we exemplify how the obtained results can be employed for linguistic investigations in Section <ref>. 
To improve the cross–linguistic comparability of the analysis, we relied on Parallel UD (PUD) treebanks: a collection of parallel treebanks developed for the CoNLL–2017 Shared Task on multilingual parsing <cit.> and linguistically annotated under the UD representation. Being parallel, PUDs are particularly well suited for carrying out multilingual studies since they contain only 1,000 sentences manually translated from English into the other languages, representing a perfect testbed for our approach. 

Before concluding the paper in Section <ref>, we report 
the results of preliminary investigations to explore whether our approach could also be employed for automatically identifying underrepresented phenomena in treebanks. leakiness and leakiness2 argue that some treebanks cover only a restricted sample of the structures commonly used in a language, leaving out less common phenomena. This leakiness might affect the performances of NLP systems even more than the system architecture. Thus, treebanks should be expanded not only to improve their representativeness but also to obtain more truthful performances of systems trained using them. 
Section <ref> investigates if our methodology can contribute to this issue by exploring its application in automatic treebank expansion.

The contributions of the paper can be listed as: (i) a novel approach specifically designed for carrying out multilingual investigations on small treebanks; (ii) a case study involving eight typologically different languages to test the methodology; and (iii) 
a novel formula, introduced in Section <ref>, to measure the distance between dependents and their syntactic head which improves the cross-lingual comparability of treebanks with respect to such property.","We proposed a novel workflow to adapt an existing approach for treebank exploration to small treebanks and low-resourced languages. Results of our analyses showed the effectiveness of the methodology in multiple scenarios. First, the adapted method allows obtaining reliable results on par with the original method workflow when performing linguistic explorations of the treebanks. Secondly, the results also show the potential of the method for automatically identifying underrepresented constructions in treebanks. The latter result paves the way for the automatic identification of cases required to expand the treebanks, which we plan to further investigate in future work.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

In this paper, we describe our approach to the sentiment classification challenge on Italian reviews in the healthcare domain. Firstly, we followed the work of Bacco et al. Bacco2020AML from which we obtained the dataset. Then, we generated our model called based on <cit.>. Through an extensive comparative analysis of the results obtained, we showed how the use of syntax can improve performance in terms of both accuracy and F1-score compared to previously proposed models. Finally, we explored the interpretative power of -viz to explain the inferences made by neural networks on examples.","People are practically reviewing anything in on-line sites and understanding the polarization of a comment through automatic sentiment classifier is a tantalizing challenge. In recent years, the number of virtual reviewers has drastically increased and there are many products and services, which can be reviewed. 




Each person, before buying a product or a service, searches into reviews from people who have already had experienced the product or the service.

Review portals are usually linked to the leisure or business activities such as the world of tourism, e-commerce or movies. 
However, there are topics where these reviews and the associated automatic computed sentiment may induce to select wrong services, which may dramatically affect personal life. 

When dealing with health-related services, the effect of positive or negative reviews on hospitals and doctors can have a potential catastrophic impact on the health of who is using this piece of information. QSalute [https://www.qsalute.it/] is one of the most important Italian portals of reviews about hospitals, nursing homes and doctors. It is very important for patients to seek the best hospital for their condition based on the past experience of other patients. Reviews in the world of health benefit both patients and hospitals because they are a means to discover problems and solve them <cit.>.


Automatic sentiment analyzer have then a big responsibility in the context of health-related services. 
In these sensitive areas, it is important to design AI systems whose decisions are transparent <cit.>, that is, the systems must give the motivation for the choice made so that people can trust. If the users do not trust a model or a prediction, they will not use it <cit.>.




In this article, we investigate a model that can mitigate the responsibility of sentiment analyzers for health-related services. The model we are using exploits syntactic information within neural networks to provide a clear visualisation of the internal decision mechanism of the model that produced the decision. We propose ( for HealthCare) based on <cit.> to solve the sentiment analysis task introduced by Bacco el al.Bacco2020AML. We use on QSalute Italian portal reviews in order to include symbolic knowledge as a part of the architecture and visualize the internal decision-making mechanism of the neural model, using -viz <cit.>.


In the rest of paper, Section <ref> gives details about the dataset and methods, while Section <ref> and <ref> describe the experiments, the results obtained and their discussion. Finally, in Section <ref> we present the final conclusions and future goals.","In this article, we investigated a model that can mitigate the responsibility of sentiment analyzers for health-related services. Our model exploits syntactic information within neural networks to provide a clear visualisation of its internal decision mechanism. is based on <cit.> and we worked in a sentiment analysis task introduced by Bacco el al.Bacco2020AML.

We studied several versions of pre-trained BERT models on the Italian language and found out that AlBERTo is, among them, the best model for this task. However, , which is composed of +AlBERTo, outperforms better than AlBERTo model alone.
Additionally, via -viz, we visualized the reasons why classifies the dataset. We observed how captures relevant syntactic information by catching the keywords in each sentence giving them more weight in the decision phase, mitigating and capturing possible errors of the sentiment analysers.
Our future goal is to be able to have full control of the sentiment analysers by injecting human rules <cit.> in order to mitigate possible errors.

To ensure widespread information on the decisions of the courts, in Italy, for this purpose, a specific body draws up massime. These massime present, in a short but detailed way, a legal principle present in judgments. Hence, justice professionals can read these massime instead of the complete legal decisions. The process of analyzing judgments and extracting relevant sentences can be significantly simplified through the use of pre-trained models, which serve as versatile universal sentence/text encoders, capable of addressing various downstream tasks, including summarization. These models consistently outperform other approaches, especially after fine-tuning or domain-adaptation. However, despite the success of pre-trained transformers in other summarization tasks, the task of producing massime is challenging for current extractive and abstractive summarization systems. Unlike standard summaries, massime must follow rigorous specifications in some courts. Extractive and abstractive summarization datasets and related systems, in contrast, aim to reduce the size of a text while preserving its overall meaning. However, this approach differs from the specific requirements of creating massime. Additionally, legal texts are often extensive, further increasing the summarization task’s complexity. Identifying the portions of the text that contain the relevant information to be reported in the massime becomes challenging due to their length. Legal document summarization has seen rapid progress in recent years, and several approaches have been proposed to manage this kind of data, ranging from fine-tuned Transformer models on the legal domain, Reinforcement Learning to Generative Models. In this paper, we compare extractive summarization models to produce massime in two different contexts: the Constitutional Court (Corte Costituzionale) and the Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione). We discuss similarities and differences regarding massime and how the type of court impacts the data in terms of their availability and privacy management. Then, we propose two models tailored to the specific type of courts, discussing the approaches we implemented to circumvent the issues related to lengthy documents. Results of the experiments confirm that producing massime is a real challenge even for dedicated systems. Hence, these systems should be designed as facilitators in a human-in-the-loop environment.","In conclusion, while we did not achieve outstanding results, our efforts shed light on the intricacies of this challenging problem. During our analysis, we also noticed notable differences between the two courts, which further emphasizes the complexity of generating accurate massime. We find it particularly intriguing to explore the factors contributing to these variations and understand how they impact the summarization process. Despite the challenges, we remain committed to refining our approach and exploring innovative techniques. Recent advances in the field further motivate us to seek a proper solution that addresses data privacy concerns and significantly improves the task of summarization in the legal field for the Italian language.",20,In-domain IR and IE

This paper introduces CorpusCompass, a new open-source tool for data extraction and dataset creation, which offers a number of functionalities for researchers interested in analyzing corpora. The tool can derive structured datasets from text annotated with custom annotation schemes, while also checking for errors and consistency. By defining custom variables of interest and annotation rules, researchers can tailor the tool to their specific needs, making it particularly valuable for unique linguistic research domains. When used in conjunction with statistical analysis or visualization tools, CorpusCompass helps researchers to gain insights into the factors that are affecting language use. In this paper, we introduce the tool and give a real-world example in the field of language variation.","In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studying language variation in under-resourced languages. Mair [1] identifies a lack of resources for spoken data in corpus linguistics and emphasizes the need for more computational tools for different languages and varieties. The process of creating and analyzing a spoken language corpus is complex, posing a range of challenges for researchers in the field of Corpus Linguistics. In this context, we identify six main steps for this process, each presenting its own set of practical and technical challenges, see Figure 1. Step (i) entails sourcing and recording data, along with the associated metadata, which provides essential contextual information about the recordings. Following this, step (ii) involves transcribing the spoken data to convert it into a text-based format, allowing for more straightforward analysis. The third step (iii) involves annotating the data with linguistic features, such as phonological or morphological information. Subsequently, step (iv) requires data preprocessing to clean and organize the data, preparing it for the fifth step, (v), which is data analysis. This stage allows researchers to derive insights from the corpus by examining patterns and connections within the data. Lastly, the final step, (vi), involves publishing and sharing the corpus with the wider research community, promoting collaboration and further research based on the spoken language data. Annotating can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, especially when working with large corpora. Errors in a manually annotated corpus can potentially affect the evaluation. Additionally, poor quality annotation in the corpus can lead to misleading results in a linguistic analysis. This is where CorpusCompass comes into play. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of CorpusCompass, including its design, implementation, and functionalities. The tool is based on Jupyter Notebook and is designed to help Corpus Linguistics researchers focusing on language variation to create a structured dataset from their previously annotated corpus/corpora and a list of variables of interest (see Section 3.1). The tool is coded in Python and can be run in an interactive manner using Google Colab. Once run, it generates a structured dataset, i.e., a systematically organized collection of data, that includes linguistic variables and potentially relevant metadata (see Section 3.2). On the one hand, the dataset enables corpus exploration, assisting in discovering patterns that can inform the creation of new hypotheses or the dismissal of initial assumptions (see Al-Wer et al. [2], pp. 37-38). On the other hand, it facilitates performing statistical analyses using established methods through platforms like Rbrul [3], SPSS [4], and R [5]. To exemplify the practical application of CorpusCompass within a research context, Section 4 explores a case study on inter-generational linguistic variation among Iraqi speakers living in Germany, and highlights various potential uses of the tool. For linguists without any or limited programming skills, CorpusCompass has the potential of saving time (by automating repetitive tasks) and improving the accuracy of their research. It is intended to bridge the gap between researchers and advanced statistical analysis by facilitating the connection between them, as well as addressing research questions that require the use of manually annotated data. Moreover, CorpusCompass was developed by researchers in Linguistics and Computer Science to advance Corpus Linguistics tools and promote interdisciplinary collaboration.","Creating and analyzing a corpus is a complex task that requires a range of technical and practical skills. In this paper, we have explored the challenges involved in these steps and introduced CorpusCompass as an innovative solution. The tool’s aim is to simplify data extraction and dataset generation, facilitating the identification of significant features and syntactic errors in the annotations. This contributes to advancing the overall replicability of studies within the field of Corpus Linguistics. As CorpusCompass is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, it also serves as an accessible introduction to programming for researchers who wish to expand their skill set and gain more control over their analytical processes. Additionally, we have presented a real-world example of how CorpusCompass can be applied in the field of language variation by using a subset of our corpus of Arabic varieties spoken by migrants in Germany, representing an under-resourced language. The example shows how the generated dataset can be used in conjunction with existing analysis tools to answer unique research questions. With CorpusCompass, we aim to contribute to the development of tools for spoken language corpora. The existence of this tool and its accessibility to researchers without a background in programming will lead to more quantitative studies that analyze such corpora. The tool exemplifies interdisciplinary collaboration and emphasizes the importance of linguistics researchers working with experts from computer science and engineering. This collaboration results in the development of flexible corpus tools applicable to a wide range of research studies. Sharing is Caring: It is essential to highlight that structured datasets are crucial for sharing data in linguistic research, particularly in connection to research data management practices and platforms such as Figshare [24]. Organized data facilitates sharing and reusability among researchers, enabling more extensive collaborations and the creation of larger datasets. Furthermore, structured datasets allow researchers to replicate and verify research findings, promoting transparency and accountability in the scientific community. Therefore, creating a structured dataset is not only essential for internal analysis but also for the advancement of the field and the dissemination of knowledge.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Questo contributo presenta l'architettura della piattaforma, il processo di costruzione della base di conoscenza e le direzioni future, discutendo il potenziamento del giornalismo attraverso l’intelligenza artificiale nel rispetto dei principi de Il Manifesto.","The historical archive of the newspaper il Manifesto is an asset protected by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage as being of particular interest. The archive includes a paper collection starting from 1971 and a digitized collection starting from the 1990s. Now entrusted to the Nuovo Manifesto Società Cooperativa Editrice, which has published the newspaper and its digital editions since 2013, the cooperative is committed to maintaining and improving the archive, as well as ensuring free access and digital consultation facilities for all interested. The digital archive, produced in phases over the years, reflects the historical and technological evolution of the publishing sector. Initially, the database included 10,013 digitized files containing about 160,000 articles, with some gaps in the years 1985-1986 and 1994-2002. Il Manifesto considers an 'intelligent archive' to be the cornerstone of its digital strategy, seeking to align it with new technologies and investing in research and development accordingly. The MeMa (Memoria Manifesta) project began in 2020 in partnership with Salvatore Iaconesi and Oriana Persico, aiming to develop new archive infrastructure based on Artificial Intelligence. This 'Community AI' is built on principles of openness, transparency, collaboration, and non-extractiveness, designed to foster productive relationships between the archive, the editorial staff, user communities, and society. In 2023, when the project was resumed, the new board decided to continue with the original plan, evolving it toward Linked Open Data and leveraging recent advances in language and knowledge technologies. The goal was to create a standards-based Knowledge Graph (KG) using editorial metadata and structured information extracted from article text—a concept previously explored, though unique in its adaptation to the specific workflows and organizational habits of il Manifesto. Commercial platforms, such as Neo4j or Ontotext, offer similar solutions, but success here required a customized platform that aligns with the newspaper community’s processes for producing, organizing, enriching, and experiencing content. Additionally, MeMa, as a sociotechnical platform, encourages user curation and contributions—from readers, archivists, and journalists—to collaboratively evolve the AI, including correcting errors typical of current NLP technologies. Consequently, we began designing a custom platform around an open graph database core, specifically Apache Jena, and incorporating open linguistic technologies suited to Italian. This solution falls within the scope of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, which are becoming established as rational counterparts to generative linguistic technologies based on neural models. This paper provides an initial account of our analysis, design, and development progress, as well as plans for addressing the socio-technical needs identified thus far. Our contribution serves as a 'reality check' on applying knowledge and language technologies to complex texts produced by an Italian publishing community over more than 40 years. Broadly, our research focuses on the interaction between digital systems and users to ensure transparent and accessible content for diverse user communities. Linguistically, the texts reflect both a specific idiolect and diachronic variations over time. This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 offers an architectural overview of the platform, Section 3 details the knowledge base construction process, and Section 4 discusses challenges and potential future directions. Notably, automatic content generation is not part of the AI-driven journalism enhancements intended by il Manifesto.","Constructing MeMa’s Knowledge Graph (KG) provides a valuable opportunity to assess the current NLP landscape within a real Italian content production setting. The KG will be made accessible later this year through a SPARQL endpoint and a dataset collection. At this stage, our experience highlights both the potential and limitations of NLP technologies when applied to a large corpus of newspaper articles spanning a significant time period, characterized by sophisticated use of the Italian language. In general, structured knowledge extraction can be achieved with various levels of granularity by integrating NLP processors, including named entity recognizers, event recognizers, role labelers, keyword and topic extractors. Pre-trained multilingual large language models (LLMs) based on generative transformers are expected to gradually replace the supervised methods that have dominated these technologies over the past decade, simplifying the extraction of meaningful semantic information. However, these neural technologies are not entirely free from errors, particularly due to the inventive linguistic generation they may produce. Enabling the user community to 'educate' the AI—by monitoring and correcting its results—remains our primary approach. Transparent logical structures, such as Knowledge Graphs, provide robust support for this kind of user engagement. The way information automatically extracted from text can be conceptualized and critically examined by user communities will profoundly influence the integration of AI within human ecosystems.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

To overcome this, we propose a novel task called Book Author Prediction, where we predict the author of a book based on user-generated reviews’ writing style. To this aim, we first introduce the ‘Literary Voices Corpus’ (LVC), a dataset of Italian book reviews, and use it to train and test machine learning models. Our study contributes valuable insights for developing user-centric systems that recommend leisure readings based on individual readers’ interests and writing styles.","Reading for pleasure is currently experiencing a significant decline, as evidenced by surveys indicating that leisure reading has reached an unprecedented low. Book recommender systems have been proposed as a valuable tool to promote the practice of reading for pleasure. These systems provide personalized suggestions and aid users in navigating the vast array of available literary works. Their integration into e-commerce services has long been explored, as it benefits both sellers and consumers. Typically integrated with online platforms, book recommender systems rely on the history of users to predict their future interests and provide recommendations based on the literary genre or authors that users have previously engaged with. While recommending the other books by an author that the reader enjoyed is trivial, suggesting books belonging to the same genre remains a complex area of study, particularly concerning literary novels. This is mostly due to the fact that the notion of genre represents a quite heterogeneous object of study due to multiple factors. In fact, the same book can be assigned to more than one literary genre either on the same reading platform or across diverse platforms. Accordingly, various approaches have been proposed to automatically identify literary genres using book content, titles or summaries, and even cover designs. Nevertheless, these models often face challenges when book content is inaccessible due to licensing restrictions. Consequently, an alternative and promising line of research on book recommender systems involves leveraging user reviews as a valuable source of information for generating recommendations. Analyzing reviews allows for a unique perspective on books from the viewpoint of their readers, without requiring access to their content. Reviews offer valuable insights into readers’ opinions and preferences, and they have been effectively utilized to predict trends in the book market. There are few attempts to exploit user reviews also for literary genre identification. These include [16] and [17] for English and Portuguese book reviews respectively. We have also contributed to this line of research by focusing on Italian book reviews. In our previous work, we demonstrated how book reviews published by amateur readers on two social reading platforms, namely Amazon and Goodreads, can be exploited to automatically identify the genre of the reviewed book. Building upon our prior investigations, our current research aims to explore whether the writing style of user-generated reviews, analyzed in terms of lexical and (morpho-)syntactic characteristics, can serve as a reliable source of information also to predict the author of a reviewed book. We started from the assumption that the vague definition of literary genres might make recommendations based on related authors more effective than genre-based approaches. To this end, inspired by the literature on Authorship Attribution, we introduced a novel task named Book Author Prediction. We tackle the problem as a supervised classification task, where the objective is to predict the author of a given book from a set of potential candidates. It is important to note that, unlike the traditional Authorship Attribution task, our information source consists of user-generated reviews rather than the books authored by the novelists themselves. This distinction adds a layer of complexity to the task, making it particularly challenging and novel in its approach. As a crucial step towards this objective, we introduce a novel dataset of Amazon and Goodreads book reviews, the ‘Literary Voices Corpus’ (LVC). The dataset successfully served in diverse experimental settings we explored in this work aimed at training and testing pretrained and traditional machine learning models, that use different configurations of lexical and (morpho-)syntactic features, to accomplish the new prediction task. The work presented in this study falls within the context of collective efforts to foster the habit of reading and enlarge the readership across different target audiences. Among these initiatives, LettERE (Letture pER TE) is a project that aims to encourage and promote the practice of reading by creating a reading recommendation system that provides personalised recommendations tailored to the reader’s language skills and interests (see Acknowledgements). In this regard, the research presented in this paper contributes significantly to the LettERE project’s objectives by showing that user-generated reviews can be effectively used to identify readers sharing common interests and ultimately provide personalised book recommendations. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents LVC, the novel collection of Italian book reviews referring to the books of six popular authors. Section 3 introduces the Book Author Prediction task and details the methodology and models exploited in this work to address it. Section 4 presents the results of our experiments. Finally, Section 5 offers conclusions and outlines potential future research directions.","This paper has explored an innovative approach that leverages user reviews as a source of information for Book Author Prediction. Building upon our prior work, we introduced a novel dataset of Amazon and Goodreads book reviews, LVC, which has been used for training and evaluating machine learning models addressing the novel book author prediction task. Our findings highlight the challenging nature of predicting the author of a novel from a reader’s review. However, the analysis of erroneous predictions pointed us to cases of books sharing a similar readership. This observation supports the intuition that user-generated reviews can effectively serve as a basis for personalized book recommendations. By analyzing reviews, we gained insights into readers’ preferences beyond the writing style of the book’s author, opening up new avenues for more tailored and user-centric recommendations. Moving forward, this research could be expanded by investigating the impact of exploiting user judgments as an additional feature for classification. Furthermore, the sentiment expressed by readers about a book, whether positive or negative, could be leveraged to validate and fine-tune personalized recommendations.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the integrated gradients of pre-trained language models to automatically predict both hate speech and the potential disagreement that can arise from readers. The integrated gradient attributions are used to shed light on the model’s decision-making process, attributing importance scores to individual tokens and enabling the identification of crucial factors contributing to disagreement and hate speech classifications. The integrated gradients’ straightforwardness allows for the recognition of fundamental causes of disagreements and hate speech content. By adopting an interpretable approach, we bridge the gap between model predictions and human comprehension. Our experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming traditional BERT models and state-of-the-art methods in both prediction tasks.","In the modern era, human beings are constantly absorbing content of various kinds generated and shared on the web. To ensure the sustainability of this continuous flow of information and promote individual and societal well-being in the online context, it is important to recognize where hate content can harm on a personal level. Individuals, based on their cultural beliefs and backgrounds, may have varying susceptibility to potentially offensive content. Thus, it is necessary to safeguard different perspectives by developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models capable of capturing and modeling diverse perceptions. Addressing disagreement, particularly in relation to hate speech detection, has garnered increasing interest in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. Although numerous approaches have been developed to handle disagreement in hate speech detection [5, 6, 7, 8], few have truly focused on modeling perspectivism. Identifying potential disagreements within hateful content, especially in recognizing controversial elements, is crucial for several reasons. When the possibility of disagreement arises in hateful texts shared on social media platforms like Twitter, it becomes essential to have a service that can recognize if the content might cause disagreement and act as a filter based on personal perspectives. Moreover, a detoxification strategy could be implemented to notify authors of user-generated content, cautioning them about the potential perception of their text as hateful by certain readers and suggesting revisions. Recognizing disagreements within hateful sentences and determining the associated disagreement-related elements can significantly contribute to the creation of reliable benchmarks. For content prone to disagreements, specific annotation policies can be implemented, such as involving more annotators or excluding such samples from datasets. Annotators could also be guided with cues to focus on particular elements that may be perceived differently by readers, like words, hashtags, or emojis linked to disagreement-related elements. In this paper, we aim to connect hate speech and disagreement by identifying which hateful elements contribute most to predicting disagreement. We combine pre-trained language models and integrated gradients, providing key contributions: a filtering strategy for textual constituents that helps explain hateful messages and a unified model that, by predicting hateful content and explaining it, forecasts if disagreement may arise from the content. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 offers an overview of the state of the art, Section 3 describes the datasets, Section 4 details the proposed approach, Section 5 presents the results, and Section 6 concludes with future research directions.","The proposed paper introduces a novel approach for detecting disagreement within hateful content, leveraging integrated gradients from pre-trained language models to predict both hate speech and potential disagreement among diverse readers. The approach is evaluated on four benchmark datasets related to Learning With Disagreements, and results show that it outperforms the baseline m-BERT model in predicting disagreement. Notably, one of the proposed strategies, NN + Dist, performs exceptionally well, achieving statistically significant improvements over the m-BERT-based baseline. Overall, this approach demonstrates promising potential for predicting disagreement within hateful content compared to traditional BERT models. Future work could explore the applicability of this approach across other languages and expand its scope to include multimodal data analysis, given the growing prevalence of images and videos in online communication.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Passaro, Alessandro Lenci",Challenging specialized transformers on zero-shot classification,ENG,6,3,1,Università di Pisa,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"This paper explores the feasibility of using basic prompting systems with domain-specific language models, focusing on bureaucratic language through experiments with the recently introduced BureauBERTo model. The experiments reveal that, although additional pre-trained models show reduced robustness in terms of general knowledge, they exhibit higher adaptability for domain-specific tasks, even in a zero-shot setting. These findings highlight the potential of simple prompting systems in specialized contexts, offering valuable insights for both research and industry.","Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly impacted Natural Language Processing (NLP), establishing the pre-train and fine-tune paradigm as the leading approach for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, a major limitation of PLMs is the scarcity of annotated data required to fine-tune classification layers, particularly for domain-specific applications. Recently, prompt-based tuning has emerged as a promising alternative that significantly reduces the need for annotated data, proving especially effective with Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, LLMs are often unavailable for low-resource languages and exhibit reduced performance in specialized domains. To address these issues, we tested BureauBERTo, a model pre-trained on Italian bureaucratic texts, in a zero-shot setting using prompt-based tuning. Given BureauBERTo’s accuracy in fill-mask tasks, we further examined its domain-specific lexical knowledge for two classification tasks in the public administration (PA) domain: predicting PA text topics and identifying generic and PA-related named entities in administrative sentences. We conducted two prompting experiments per task, first using Italian classification labels as label words and then assigning in-domain terms to each class, also comparing BureauBERTo to the Italian generic PLM UmBERTo. Our findings indicate that in zero-shot classification, where label words are only loosely related to the text or entity, both generic and domain-specialized models perform poorly. However, when classes are represented by semantically aligned multi-word labels, PLMs significantly improve, particularly the domain-adapted BureauBERTo, which outperformed UmBERTo in both tasks. This suggests that the additional domain-specific pre-training phase equips BureauBERTo with valuable lexical knowledge for prompt-based tuning, especially in scenarios where word knowledge plays a critical role.","In this paper, we propose a zero-shot prompt tuning classification approach for solving two tasks related to the Italian PA domain: the classification of documents according to their topic and the recognition of the entity types occurring in administrative sentences. We compared the results obtained in these two tasks by the PA-specialized model BureauBERTo with those of the domain-agnostic model UmBERTo. Our findings show that by enriching with domain terms the set of word labels encoded in the prompt verbalizer both models demonstrated enhanced performances. Moreover, BureauBERTo exhibited an improvement over UmBERTo of +0.06 Weighted Average F1 score in the document classification (0.51 vs. 0.57) and of more than twofold in the entity typing task (0.516 vs. 0.368 for Macro Average F1 score), meaning that the domain adapted model is more proficient in leveraging domain-specific terminology. These results underscore the importance of tailoring language models to specific domains to unlock their full potential and address the nuanced challenges posed by diverse subject matters. However, it is also worth mentioning that we noticed a high variability in the task results according to different prompting and different label words. In particular, when the label words adopted to depict a certain topic class are, within the domain context, semantically related to the label words of another class, the models’ classification output seems to be biased in favor of one of the two classes. In conclusion, our study underscores the critical need for a thorough exploration of prompt engineering, particularly in the context of the entity typing task. This imperative arises not only from the potential to augment the predictive capabilities of models, but also from the need to consolidate the knowledge related to general entity classes. Notably, the Public Administration (PA) domain exhibits distinctive characteristics, both in terms of referencing entity names within documents and employing domain-specific terminology. Notably, the identified patterns within the PA domain deviate from the broader, general-purpose Italian style, indicating the necessity for tailored, domain-specific prompt experimentation. This investigative effort shed the linguistic intricacies that exert an impact on Transformer model performance. Our findings, as revealed in the ablation study on entity linking, emphasize the pivotal importance of delving into the interplay among different entity classes present in datasets. A nuanced analysis of how these classes interact and potentially overlap is indispensable for honing the model’s ability to distinguish between them in a domain-specific context. To conclude, this leads us to surmise as a future direction for our work a further inspection of how domain-adapted PLMs encode in their embedding the semantics of domain-related terms and how this information relates to their performance in prompt-based tasks.",1,Language Models

In particular, a bias estimation technique is proposed to identify those textual and visual elements that unintendedly affect the model prediction, together with a naive bias mitigation strategy. The proposed approach is able to achieve good recognition performance characterized by promising generalization capabilities.","In the context of social media, memes have become popular as a means of expressing irony or opinions on various topics. However, these memes can also perpetuate discriminatory behaviours towards certain groups and minorities. Misogyny, in particular, has gained attention as a form of hateful language conveyed through memes in various ways, such as female stereotyping, shaming, objectification, and violence. While misogyny recognition mechanisms have been widely investigated focusing on textual sources (i.e., tweets) [1, 2, 3, 4], misogynous identification in multimodal settings, and in particular on memes, is still in its infancy. In [5], a few naive unimodal and multimodal approaches have been investigated to understand the contribution of textual and visual cues. Further investigations from the same authors [6] have introduced a multimodal approach that considers both visual (in the form of captioning) and textual information to distinguish between misogynous and non-misogynous memes. Recently, the performance of multiple pre-trained and trained from scratch models have been compared to verify if domain-specific pre-training could help to improve the recognition performance [7]. Independently on the textual, visual or multimodal sources, several authors highlighted how the classification models may be subject to bias that could affect the real performance of the models [8, 9] in a real setting. Most of the investigations propose a few bias estimation metrics and related mitigation policies that are based on a fixed set of seed words to quantify and minimize the bias at the dataset or model level. When dealing with misogynous memes recognition, metrics to estimate the bias and techniques to mitigate it are still missing. To this purpose, we provide the following main contributions: a candidate biased elements identification in a multi-modal setting, focusing on both textual and visual constituents of a meme; a mitigation strategy at training time, named Masking Mitigation, that masks the candidate biased elements to reduce the distortion introduced by their presence.

This work proposes a way to make mathematical expressions easier to be accessed by people with disabilities by exploiting their hierarchical structures. We describe and evaluate a dialogue system to vocally navigate mathematical expressions in English. In contrast with standard screen readers, the vocal interaction allows people to query the system about sub-parts of the expressions.","In the last few years, improvements in speech technologies have enabled the use of Natural Language Processing in various application domains. Among these, the field of assistive technologies stands out as one with the most potential. Specifically, spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) can enhance the quality of life for numerous users with special needs. In this paper we study the task of accessing mathematics for blind people. Traditionally, people with a visual impairment, in order to acquire mathematics, use LATEX with screen readers, that are dedicated text-to-speech software. However, LATEX is verbose, slow to listen, and not well known in young people. Indeed, LATEX is designed as a typographical language, that is a technical language to provide typographical details rather than a compact description of a mathematical content. Moreover, mathematical expressions can range over multiple dimensions (e.g. fractions are arranged on two levels) and the linear encoding of LATEX can produce a very long sequence with distant relations among symbols closely connected. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose a SDS based on the main idea to use standard natural language to interact with mathematical contents. For instance by using a SDS people with a visual impairment do not need to use a keyboard and a mouse to use their device. They can activate vocally the SDS to interact directly. Furthermore, this approach can also address other disabilities, including motor impairments. The SDS uses mathematical sentences, that are natural language sentences containing the semantics of a mathematical expression [1, 2]. There are many advantages in using mathematical sentences with respect to LATEX. First, mathematical sentences are shorter. Second, they are not semantically ambiguous as some LATEX expressions (e.g. f(x) could also stand for f ·(x)). Third, they do not require knowledge of LATEX, so that they can be used by a wider class of users (e.g. children). In particular, the SDS converts the LATEX encoding of the mathematical expression in a semantic language, called Content Math Markup Language (CMML)1. From CMML, English mathematical sentences are generated according to good practices for spoken mathematics [3], through a standard Natural Language Generation (NLG) architecture, i.e. a sentence planner and a realizer. The interaction design of the SDS is quite straightforward: the SDS pronounces the mathematical sentences and the user can interrupt it to “navigate” the expression (e.g. ask for repetition of its parts). So, the dialogue manager component coordinates the recognition of a repetition command with the generation of (a subpart of) the mathematical sentence. We performed a user-based evaluation on the effectiveness and the usability of the SDS. The system implementation and evaluation were conducted with the involvement of visually impaired experts. The results show that the developed system has a good impact both on the comprehension of mathematical expressions and on the user experience, constituting a promising approach for helping people with visual impairments. The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we report related work. In Section 3, we describe the main components of the SDS. In Section 4, we describe a human-based evaluation of the SDS and in Section 5, we closes the paper with some consideration and future work. Finally, Section 6 discusses some limitations of our SDS.","In this paper we described a SDS designed for allowing visually impaired people to access mathematical expressions. In Experiment 1 we focused on the understanding of the mathematical sentences generator for English (i.e. using EM and SPICE measures), replicating the good results obtained for Italian in Mazzei et al. [1, 2]. In Experiment 2, we tested the complete SDS allowing user to ask for repetition. With respect to expressions understanding, the results of this experimentation are less encouraging than Experiment 1, but we speculate that this is a consequence of the complexity of the experimental setting due to the necessity of online interaction. However, the UEQ showed that the users really appreciated the interaction with the SDS. In the future we want to improve the SDS by adding new intents. Moreover, we want to define a new SDS designed for diagrams and other visual structures, creating accurate descriptions and making them navigable.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

These models are trained on massive amounts of image-caption pairs and show impressive performance on zero-shot image classification. However, their usage is limited to English due to their training data. Training the same model for different languages is non-trivial since the amount of natural data in those might not be sufficient, and automatic translations of original captions might not have sufficient quality, harming performance. In this paper, we present the first CLIP model for the Italian Language (CLIP-Italian), trained on more than 1.4 million image-text pairs. Results show that CLIP-Italian outperforms a multilingual CLIP model on image retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks for the Italian language.","The recent interest in combining different source domains to incorporate broader context in the training process has led to a surge in multi-modal models spanning modalities like text and vision [1] or text and speech [2]. A multi-modal architecture learns by jointly optimizing its parameters on two or more input domains (e.g., images, texts, tabular data, or audio signals), with a cost function that may vary depending on the task. Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training (CLIP) [1] is a multi-modal model for joint learning image and text representations. CLIP learns to pair visual concepts with descriptions in natural language by leveraging a contrastive loss that pushes images and their respective captions closer in an embedding space. CLIP is trained on a large-scale dataset of images and their corresponding captions. The dataset used in the seminal paper contains 400 million images collected from the web. In recent years, there have been many successful domain-specific implementations of CLIP [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, inter alia]. While the model shows impressive zero-shot performance across various supervised tasks, its capabilities are bounded to the language the model is trained in, i.e., English. Despite the ongoing efforts on training multilingual variants of CLIP, different works have shown that multilingual models often do not achieve the same level of performance as language-specific ones [8, 9, 10]. In this paper, we describe how to fine-tune a specialized version of CLIP in a language different than English, i.e., Italian. We dub this model CLIP-Italian. Crucially, we collect for the task a dataset of 1.4M high-quality text-image pairs for Italian, the largest collection of this kind to date. We release our best-performing checkpoint, the modeling and training code, a CometML report with training logs and metrics, and a live demo to showcase CLIP-Italian capabilities and streamline testing.","This paper presents the first CLIP model for the Italian language, trained on 1.4 million image-text pairs.

The lexicon has been made interoperable with a set of lexical and textual linguistic resources for Latin in the Lila Knowledge Base.","Over the past decades, several linguistic resources for historical languages have become available in digital format. This has given scholars the chance to access and exploit them in a quicker and deeper way. In particular, several different linguistic resources are available for Latin today. They consist of textual corpora, such as the LASLA corpus for Classical Latin and the Index Thomisticus Treebank for Medieval Latin, and lexical resources, like the Lewis and Short dictionary and the Logeion metadictionary. Due to the centuries-long lexicographic tradition for the Latin language, its lexical resources comprise a number of etymological dictionaries. A dictionary is defined as etymological when it contains information about the etymology of its entries, that is about their origin and historical development: for Indo-European (IE) languages, etymological dictionaries often put their entries in relation with reconstructed Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots, minimal lexical units to which the dictionary’s entry and further related formations may be traced back. It is also often explained by which morphological processes the attested word has been formed from the root. Even if the available resources (for Latin and beyond) provide a huge amount of linguistic information, at the present day, their full exploitation is still hindered by their isolation. In fact, most resources can be accessed only individually, and cannot interact. Isolation of resources is an issue because each resource can really reach its potential only when it is made interoperable with other (types of) resources. Today, interoperability between linguistic resources can be obtained by describing and publishing their data according to the principles of the Linked Open Data paradigm. As a consequence, in recent years, the amount of linguistic resources published as Linked Open Data has been raised substantially, as witnessed by the growing size of the Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud (LLOD Cloud). In particular, the LiLa Knowledge Base represents a successful example of Linked Open Data (LOD) principles applied to linguistic resources for Latin. Although LiLa currently makes quite a number of linguistic resources for Latin interoperable, there is still a large set of digitized materials to interlink in the Knowledge Base. Among them is an important etymological dictionary, the Lexicon der indogermanischen Verben (LIV). This paper describes the process of transforming information contained in this dictionary into a LLOD resource, linked to LiLa. Section 2 describes the LiLa architecture and the LIV structure. Section 3 details the modelling of the resource, and the linking process. Section 4 describes some possible examples of exploitation and interaction. Finally, Section 5 discusses conclusions and sketches the future work.","Linking a set of data from the LIV to LiLa enhances the Knowledge Base with etymological information about the processes that, starting from PIE roots, have led to the formation of the Latin word forms. Given the highly lexically-based nature of the architecture of the Knowledge Base, this makes the linking of the LIV an important achievement of the LiLa project. The information provided by the LIV is now interoperable with that of the several other lexical resources currently interlinked through LiLa and can be queried together with the textual data provided by the Latin corpora published in the Knowledge Base. In collecting and publishing as LOD the wealth of different digital resources for Latin built so far, an important challenge is to impact the scholarly community that has long been using the data provided today by these resources. The web-based interoperability among resources permitted by the LiLa Knowledge Base makes it possible to exploit such wealth of (meta)data like never before, in terms both of the quantity of the (meta)data under analysis and of the quality of the process leading to their retrieval. Interlinking through the Knowledge Base a set of data from the LIV, a reference lexical resource for the communities of Classicists and Historical Linguists, is expected to help overcome the challenge of making the use of LiLa a daily presence in the life of scholars who work in the fields of Classics and Historical Linguistics. Finally, it is worth considering that the LIV provides etymological information not only about the Latin word forms, but, for each PIE root, it also reports a set of word forms which reflect the same root in several other IE daughter languages. The availability of this information allows for substantial research work to be performed in the near future. Indeed, by applying the principles of the Linked Data paradigm and reusing the same vocabularies adopted in LiLa to interlink the distributed linguistic resources for Latin, it is now possible to move one step further from the Latin language and aim to make interoperable word forms from several IE languages, by using the collection of PIE roots provided by the LIV as a kind of pivot resource to interlink them all.",5,Latin Resources

This paper provides a report on the activities we are carrying on at the University of Turin in the application of Sentiment Analysis to environmental topics. In pursuit of the goal of developing resources and tools specifically designed for addressing the complexity of the ongoing environmental debate, we are currently focused on exploring the language used for green issues and defining some annotation schemes that can describe them at different granularity.","It has become increasingly common to apply Sentiment Analysis (SA) and text classification to issues with social impact about which people debate. On the one hand, studying a socially impacting phenomenon from such a computational perspective means creating a precise conceptual and linguistic model, thereby achieving a greater understanding of its characteristics, its dynamics, and, not least, how people perceive it. On the other hand, it is a matter of creating tools that can help policymakers and citizens define strategies to address the problems associated with the phenomenon, bearing in mind that the impact of an intervention depends meaningfully on how it is proposed by governments and political parties and accepted by citizens. Among the issues that have a unique social importance today are certainly those related to the environment in which we live. As far as the emergency related to the environment, at first sight, one cannot but notice that the environmental issues underlie a great complexity. This is due to the mixing of natural and human entities and related interests, such as individuals, public and private organisations on the one side, and climate, animals and plants on the other one. The language used to describe and discuss environmental topics also mirrors this complexity and is featured by a certain degree of specialization. Modelling this reality can be therefore especially complex but also particularly useful because it ultimately allows us to better understand the relationship between humans and the environment and to be more aware of the sensitivity towards the environment which is hidden in us. The characteristics of the discourse about the environment can make especially challenging the classification of opinions expressed about it. We may hypothesize that an accurate annotation of data about environmental topics can be helpful in order to achieve reliable results, e.g., in the detection of the polarity or stance in these texts. According to this hypothesis, we are following two major directions: a) to preliminary analyze the linguistic features of the discourse about the environment carried on in different text genres and b) to design specific annotation schemes that take into account the specific features of these texts and to apply them on selected corpora. The first direction allowed us to better understand the meaning of the wide-spreading discussion about the language used in green communication. This was also useful in preparing the ground for the second direction of research, in which we want to model a specific form of communication about green issues, namely that realized in social media. Notwithstanding the relevance of the topics we are addressing, in agreement with the results of the systematic survey of the studies about SA applied to the environment [1], it can be observed that currently in this research area there is a gap and we want to fill it out. Only a few projects indeed exist, also for English, in which environmental topics are addressed by applying SA and in which only fairly rough techniques were used. In this paper, we describe a variety of experiences carried on at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Turin in the development of corpora and tools for SA applied to environmental topics during the last few years. The paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly surveys previous work related to the application of SA to environmental topics. Section three focuses on the collection of data, while the fourth is about the annotation schemes we adopted. Finally, the last section provides some conclusions and hints about our future works.","This paper presents a report on the activities we are carrying on at the University of Turin in the application of SA to environmental topics. Starting with a linguistic analysis of texts extracted from different genres, we are developing data sets for stance detection, fine-grained structured SA, and sentiment term extraction. Notwithstanding the relevance of these topics, very few applications of textual classification techniques and SA have been developed until now. With our activities, we want to start filling out this gap for Italian and English. Nevertheless, this is only a starting point and in future work we will address a more extended domain of texts, for example, news and interviews, so as to provide a more reliable barometer of sentiments towards climate topics as found in a general audience.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Lexical innovation in contemporary Italian in a large Twitter corpus",ENG,3,2,0,"EURAC, Università per Stranieri di Perugia",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,"Trento, Perugia","This study investigates emerging vocabulary in contemporary Italian in a corpus of 5.32M timestamped and geotagged tweets extracted from the Italian timeline throughout 2022. We automatically identify and manually distill 8,133 candidate neologisms down to 346 unattested word forms, shedding light on their spatio-temporal circulation patterns.","Lexical innovation is one of the driving mechanisms of language change [1, 2]: through the creation of new words and their integration into existing lexical systems [3], languages evolve and adapt to new social and technological contexts, which are constantly and rapidly changing. The process of creating new words can be approached from different standpoints. Firstly, the choice of sources necessary to trace the process of lexical innovation has great methodological relevance. One of the main traditional sources have been newspaper texts, which have the double benefit of being easily available and quantitatively relevant [4]. Secondly, lexical innovation follows different steps and usually develops from the initial emergence of new words in specific contexts to their proliferation to wider contexts and domains. This process may end with the institutionalisation of new word forms [5, 6] through their inclusion in dictionaries and consolidation in standard use. Thirdly, the linguistic processes leading to the creation of new words can be different and can include phenomena of derivation, composition, transcategorisation, creation of portmanteau forms, semantic shifts, and borrowing from other languages. The aim of this study is twofold. On the one hand, we present an analysis of emerging vocabulary in contemporary Italian stemming from Twitter interactions using the 2022 Italian timeline as a source; social media represents an opportunity to analyse new word forms surfacing in everyday conversation, and provide vast amounts of data produced in real time by a large, heterogeneous and representative sample of speakers. Furthermore, the availability of geotagged texts enables the investigation of possible patterns of lexical innovation related to specific geographical areas [7]. This possibility is particularly promising in languages, like Italian, characterised by deep and articulated geographical variation. On the other hand, we propose a novel methodology to process and filter word forms acquired from a sizeable Twitter corpus, with the aim of detecting those that represent the best candidates to become new words. The result of the study is a list of 346 word forms, classified into 15 categories based on the linguistic process of lexical creation and yet unattested in two of the most up-to-date Italian lexicographic resources.","Lexical innovation in Twitter seems to stem mostly from creativity, amusement and attention-seeking behaviour rather than a need for specific new words to indicate new objects, events or situations. The sense of belonging to a large and cohesive community such as Twitter plays a key role in the creation and dissemination of new words. The possibility of being adopted and reused in traditional oral conversation, in large (online) communication streams or, in a trans-medial perspective, by the press, makes at least some of these forms reliable candidates to become institutionalised neologisms. Next steps in this ongoing study, to appear in Spina et al. [31], will focus on refining the list of candidate neologisms with additional dictionary look-ups (e.g., Zingarelli [32]) and on extending the analysis to the hashtags we put aside by virtue of their multi-functional and natively univerbated nature. Furthermore, we intend on leveraging our annotation data to examine how the yields of the two methods vary in restricting the threshold choices, in the hope of locating sweet spots to use as a rule of thumb in future studies. Finally, we will experiment with an estimator for the convexity of the cumulative usage, which, while computationally comparable to ρ, has better interpretability. Should Twitter die out, planned efforts to scale-up our analysis to multiple Italian timelines will be redirected to other text-based microblogging and social networking platforms, namely Mastodon10, Bluesky11 and Threads12.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

As a step in this direction, we present several experiments on multiple-choice question answering, a setting that allows us to evaluate the stability of the model under different prompting, the capacity to understand when none of the provided answers is correct, and to reason on specific answering strategies (e.g., recursively eliminate the worst answer). We use the Italian medical specialty tests yearly administered to admit medical doctors to specialties. Results show that a gpt-3.5-turbo model achieves excellent performance in the absolute score (an average of 108 out of 140) while still suffering in certain reasoning capacities, particularly in failing to understand when none of the provided answers is correct.","Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown unprecedented results in various tasks in different languages [1]. Beyond the impressive performance, their popularity derives from the possibility of using them with no or little training data for multiple tasks and languages. In fact, instruction-tuned LLMs go beyond the previously established learning paradigm based on transfer learning — where a model, first pre-trained with no supervision, must be fine-tuned on downstream task-specific data — and are typically used in a zero- or few-shot manner. LLMs performance and ease of use have attracted interest from Natural Language Processing researchers and practitioners. However, most previous work has focused on the models’ performance and practical applications. Less relevance has been given to the models’ stability and reliability, e.g., in the variability of their outputs or reasoning capacities in controlled settings. This is even more problematic since many of the most popular and performative instruction-tuned LLMs are proprietary, and the details of the exploited data, architecture, and training procedures are at best superficially discussed in technical reports [2] rather than proper research papers, conferences, and other scientific venues. In this work, we choose a more holistic approach to analyzing results, stability, and consistency in Italian. We do so by considering a case study: the Italian medical specialty tests. The test consists of 140 multiple-choice questions in various medical areas, based on which Italian medical doctors are evaluated and ranked if they want to enroll in a medical specialty school. We chose this test for several reasons. First of all, we believe the task is intrinsically difficult. It requires domain-specific knowledge that doctors are expected to acquire after a six-year-long university career; moreover, the test contains both fact-based questions (for example, the criteria for a diagnosis) and clinical cases, which also require reasoning capabilities (for example, to decide on the most appropriate intervention given some symptoms). On the other hand, the structured nature of the test makes it more robust to the specific prompts used and allows us to measure performance easier and more reliably. We perform experiments by using ChatGPT. This choice is due to several reasons: firstly, the model is undoubtedly very popular at the time of writing; secondly, according to our preliminary experiments, its performance is superior to those of other open-source LLMs available, e.g., Alpaca [3]. While we are aware of the limitations linked to the proprietary nature of the model, we believe its black-box nature, combined with its popularity and practical importance in NLP-related applications, make an analysis of its capabilities, limitations, and stability even more urgent.","We presented several experiments to test the stability and reasoning capacities of an LLM on a multiple-choice question-answering task in the medical domain and for Italian. We evaluated several aspects of the model behavior: the stability of the model (e.g., repeated questions, stability under different prompts and under different orders of answers), the capacity to understand counterfactual reasoning (e.g., when all answer choices are incorrect), the capacity to manage specific answering strategies (e.g., recursively eliminating wrong answers). Results show that a gpt-3.5-turbo model achieves excellent performance in terms of absolute score (an average of 108, out of 140), which is surprising given the technical nature of the test. The model is also relatively stable under different prompts. The model was also able to interpret and manage prompts asking to perform recursive reasoning, even though the resulting performance is considerably worse than the baseline. The major weakness that was found is related to understanding when none of the provided answers is correct, as the model performed only slightly better than random.",1,Language Models
518_2023,2023,,"Maria Cassese, Alessandro Bondielli, Alessandro Lenci",Assessing Language and Vision-Language Models on Event Plausibility,ENG,3,1,1,Università di Pisa,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"Transformer-based Language Models (LMs) excel in many tasks, but they appear to lack robustness in capturing crucial aspects of event knowledge due to their reliance on surface-level linguistic features and the mismatch between language descriptions and real-world occurrences. In this paper, we investigate the potential of Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in comprehending Generalized Event Knowledge (GEK), aiming to determine whether the inclusion of a visual component affects the mastery of GEK. To do so, we compare multimodal Transformer models with unimodal ones on a task evaluating the plausibility of curated minimal sentence pairs. We show that current VLMs generally perform worse than their unimodal counterparts, suggesting that VL pre-training strategies are not yet as effective to model semantic understanding and resulting models are more akin to bag-of-words in this context.","Humans have rich knowledge about events and their typical participants. This is known as Generalized Event Knowledge (GEK) [1]. GEK is a fundamental part of commonsense knowledge, and plays a key role in language processing as well as in reasoning. For instance, GEK supports our intuitions about likely events (e.g., A cop arrested a thief), possible but implausible events (e.g., A thief arrested a cop), and impossible events (e.g., A stone arrested a thief). Event knowledge is intuitive for humans because we perceive the world by simultaneously processing information from different modalities such as textual, visual, and auditory [2]. In fact, GEK is acquired through linguistic (e.g., reading and talking about events) and sensorimotor experiences based on observing and participating in real-world events. Several works have investigated to what extent Language models (LMs) possess GEK [3, 4]. These analyses reveal that LMs have remarkable aspects of GEK, though with important differences with respect to humans. This prompts the question whether such differences might stem from the way LMs acquire their knowledge. In fact, even the most recent Transformer-based ones [5], do not possess the same level of multimodal integration of human learners, since they are trained solely on textual data, lacking key visual information like an object’s shape and color. In this context, it is natural to ask whether the recently introduced Vision-Language Models (VLMs) possess capabilities that surpass those of text-only LMs in modelling GEK due to their multimodal knowledge of the world. Recent literature has shown that language interpretation appear to not be improved using multimodal architectures [6], and that in some cases VLMs behave as bag-of-words models when it comes to interpreting texts [7, 8]. We contribute to this line of research by carrying out a comparative study of the performance of LMs and VLMs in recognizing event plausibility. The dataset is formed by sentences that differ for the degree of plausibility of the event they express and the argument animacy. Furthermore, we explore the effect of event concreteness on the performances of the models. Finally, we evaluate the impact of actually including images describing test events sentences as inputs for multimodal models. Our analyses reveal that VLMs do not exhibit better performances than LMs on semantic plausibility recognition, with or without images as inputs. Further, we show how more challenging sentences impact the performances of VLMs, suggesting that they are less capable than LMs in recognizing semantic differences that are affected by word orders (e.g., with subject-patient inversion). This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe related work. Then, Section 3 details the datasets (Sec. 3.1), the tested models (Sec. 3.2), and the evaluation procedure (Sec. 3.3). We show and discuss the obtained results in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions and highlights possible future works.","In this paper, we presented a set of experiments aimed at evaluating the ability of VLMs to model event plausibility in both language-only and vision-language tasks against LMs. We find that VL pre-training does not lead to a significant improvement compared to unimodal LMs in this task aiming at testing their GEK. Specifically, we observed that VLMs tend to perform worse when the implausible sentence has a higher semantic complexity, because it contains two animate nouns. Our analysis also brings further support to argument that VLMs models still behave similarly to Bag-of-Words models, regardless of the degree of concreteness of the events. In the future, we plan to focus on the analysis of models with visual grounding as their training objective, such as PaLM-E [34], a large embodied multimodal language model that directly incorporates real-world continuous sensor modalities into language processing. This may shed more light into the abilities of large multimodal models to achieve more human-level grounded language understanding.",1,Language Models

A test of re-translation of Pinocchio is presented here.","Consisting today in over three thousand pictograms and symbols, and regularly updated by Unicode Consortium, the emoji international catalog contains signs for facial expressions (smileys) and for human gestures, portraits of people, plants and the animals, reproductions of food and objects for everyday activities and sports, symbols of travel and places. Whereas the visual content seems to provide an encyclopaedic catalog with a universal status, ideally able to signify language-independent meanings, the interpretation of emojis is, on the contrary, heavily arbitrary, subject to ambiguities and differences due to linguistic and cultural specificities [2]. Some efforts were made to develop an emoji based language that could be shared among different cultural peoples. The first notable project that made an effort of translating a classical novel (“Moby Dick” of Herman Melville), was the Emoji Dick project 1 by Fred Benenson (2010). Starting from the English version of the novel, each sentence was translated into an emoji version via crowdsourcing. Each of Moby Dick’s 6,438 sentences has been translated 3 times by different Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers. The resulting emoji sentences were then chosen by voting by another set of workers, and the most popular version of each sentence was selected for inclusion in the book. The outcome is a wonderful but inconsistent translation of the same terms according to the wisdom of the crowd in good sense, but without any shared rules, structure or grammar, leading to the impossibility of recovering the original text or meaning. Another project was the translation of Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” by Joe Hale2 (2014). In this case, each word was directly translated into a corresponding emoji. Consistency was thus guaranteed as the same word was translated with the same emoji, introducing a de-facto lexicon. Nonetheless, no grammar structure is developed as the translation follows verbatim the original text and its English-based word order. In order to counteract the natural polysemy of emojis [3], Emojitaliano3 was created through a social community on Twitter (#scritturebrevi #emojitaliano), devoted to the experimental crowdsourcing construction of an international emoji code ‘emojilingua’ [4, 5]. The aim of the project includes linguistic simplification and the possibility of reproducing a text in emoji that will be comprehensible and readable in all languages of the world. For this reason, Emojitaliano consists in a unique project that provides a grammatical structure and a shared vocabulary. Emojitaliano is thus based on the assessment of conventional meanings, capable of guaranteeing the sharing of sense by means of intersemiotic translation [6]. The iconic property of emoji, together with the coded glossary and grammar, makes Emojitaliano a unique tool for communicative accessibility and for multilingual and language (L1 and L2) teaching. Born with the translation of Collodi’s Pinocchio, The Story of a Puppet4 [1], the structure and glossary of Emojitaliano have been later usefully reapplied for the translation of texts of different genres such as the technical declaratory prose of the Italian Constitution, the narrative prose of moral tales (i.e. The Wolf and the Lamb), Dante’s allegorical poetry of The Comedy, Giacomo Leopardi’s lyrical poem The infinite5. The process of such translation relied heavily on manual labor and human expertise, often time-consuming and subject to human limitations. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, a new era has dawned upon the world of translation. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BLOOM [7], GPT-3 [8], LLaMa-1 [9], have revolutionized the way we approach language translation. Recent chat interfaces enable an easy human interaction with them, that has led to a rapid and widespread adoption among the public, also due to the recent high performance closed models Chat-GPT and GPT-4, which remarkable are reported to be able to pass several human admission exams6. This preliminary assessment, thus, is about evaluating and establishing the utility of such models, even in the challenging application that is Emojitaliano, where figurative and idiomatic writing is needed, beyond the basic rules of the language.","Emojitaliano was born thanks to the free dedication and commitment of an enthusiast devoted Twitter social community, then also of student groups, willing to share the goal of building an emoji-based artificial language model, to be used as a communicative code across language barriers [5, 1]. The effort to adapt to the rules and to join the common glossary, as well as to expand it according to the common rules, was challenging as well as a hard task, but it was the only way to ensure an essential linguistic basis, by giving rise to a language, validated and practiced by a community of ‘speakers’. The intensive crowdsourcing experience made Emojitaliano a unique case among the (actually not many) examples of integral translations in emoji, which are mostly represented by intentionally non-systematic or solipsistic works. The regular expansion of the international emoji set by the Unicode Consortium constantly extends the range of choice by enriching the emoji-language with ‘emoji-neologisms’, as happens in every living natural language, but the core of the Emojitaliano glossary and grammar provides a settled authoritative translation method. Translating Pinocchio into Emojitaliano today would certainly involve new, and sometimes more relevant, pairings, synonymic pairs that do not exclude the previous ones; but the method remains fixed, because the syntax alone guarantees, through the instrument of translation, mutual understanding. Teaching Emojitaliano to GPT-4 (and the like) does not mean replacing a human translator with a machine, but rather is like having a tool to enhance human work to the maximum: automation ensures the speed, the iconic base of the emoji embeds and guides creativity, therefore setting limits against the arbitrary drift of individual subjective interpretation. Following our design, the year of work spent in the ‘human’ translation of the original 15 chapters of Pinocchio will be matched by a few minutes’ work in the translation of the entire work (35 chapters) by Chat-GPT, and in the translation of other works from any world’s language. Extreme speed is comfortable and convenient, but the results cannot be achieved without training: that is, by learning a “language” and its rules.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

These conversations begin with tweets containing misinformation in the form of racial hoaxes targeting migrants, flagged as untrustworthy by fake news debunking websites. The conversational structure of the dataset allows us to observe and collect evidence on linguistic and social phenomena involved in the spread of stereotypes and the interactions between users that arise from them. We offer a theoretical framework, along with quantitative and qualitative analyses of our annotated data at various levels of granularity, providing insights into the dynamics of Italian online discourse surrounding migration.","In the era of information overload and widespread digital communication, terms like “disinformation,” “fake news,” “hoaxes,” “misinformation,” and “rumors” have become buzzwords dominating public discourse. While these terms are often used interchangeably, it’s important to recognize the nuanced differences among them and establish clear terminology. “Fake news” refers to fabricated or misleading information presented as legitimate news, often intended to deceive or manipulate public opinion. “Disinformation” encompasses a broader range of intentionally false or misleading information disseminated with the aim of influencing beliefs or actions. Conversely, “rumor” refers to unverified or unsubstantiated pieces of information that circulate widely within communities. Recently, a specific type of rumor that spreads claims threatening the health or safety of individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, or religion has been defined as a “racial hoax” by Cerase and Santoro, updating an earlier definition from Russell. This paper aims to highlight a connection between research investigating these phenomena and research conducted in the field of Stance Detection (SD). As illustrated in Figure 1, a recent survey by Küçük and Can outlines relationships among various tasks and subtasks in Sentiment Analysis, emphasizing SD at the center. In the blue-highlighted boxes in Figure 1, we see that Rumor Stance Classification and Fake News Stance Classification are closely related to SD. In this work, we connect stance and stereotypes by re-annotating our previous corpus, focusing specifically on the conversational structure of the data. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 surveys related work on Fake News and Stance Detection on one hand, and Racial Hoaxes and Stereotypes on the other. Section 3 describes the corpus collection and the annotation process, particularly regarding stance. In Section 4, we conduct a corpus-based analysis, also considering stereotypes, and provide examples from the corpus. Finally, Section 5 discusses insights gained from observing annotated phenomena, concluding with final remarks and potential directions for future research.","In this article, we explored the expression of stance and stereotypes within a dataset of Twitter conversational threads in Italian, focused on the topic of migration. The dataset consists of dialogues originating from tweets containing misinformation marked as untrustworthy by experts. The analysis of the dataset shed light on the distribution of stance labels and their relationship with stereotypes. The majority of tweets were annotated as Comment, followed by Support, Query, and finally Deny. While there was no significant co-occurrence between stance and stereotypes, tweets annotated as Support were more likely to contain racial stereotypes. On the other hand, tweets annotated as Comment were less likely to exhibit forms of stereotyping. The corpus analysis provided insights into how the structure and nature of conversations, as well as lexical choices in messages, affect the perceived stance of users towards racial hoaxes. In conclusion, this work paves the way for further investigations into topics closely related to the social phenomenon of misinformation, which should be countered to stimulate accurate information dissemination and create a more inclusive online environment. In future research, we may increase the size of the dataset, improve the annotation guidelines, and consider the feedback provided by the annotators. We may also further investigate the relationship between stance and stereotypes, as well as explore interventions to mitigate the harmful effects of stereotypes in online conversations.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"
521_2023,2023,,"Claudia Collacciani, Giulia Rambelli",Interpretation of Generalization in Masked Language Models: An Investigation Straddling Quantifiers and Generics,ENG,2,2,1,Università di Bologna,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Bologna,"Generics are statements that express generalizations and are used to communicate generalizable knowledge. While generics convey general truths (e.g., ""Birds can fly""), they often allow for exceptions (e.g., ""penguins do not fly""). Nonetheless, generics form the basis of how we communicate our commonsense about the world. We explored the interpretation of generics in Masked Language Models (MLMs), building on psycholinguistic experimental designs. As this interpretation requires a comparison with overtly quantified sentences, we investigated: i) the probability of quantifiers, ii) the internal representation of nouns in generic vs. quantified sentences, and iii) whether the presence of a generic sentence as context influences quantifiers' probabilities. The outcomes confirm that MLMs are insensitive to quantification; nevertheless, they appear to encode a meaning associated with the generic form, which leads them to reshape the probability associated with various quantifiers when the generic sentence is provided as context.","Generic generalizations, or generics, are sentences such as ""Birds fly"" and ""Cars have four wheels,"" which allow us to convey information about categories, or kinds, of individuals. They are used to communicate information that extends beyond the present context and express our knowledge about the world, including beliefs, stereotypes, or prejudices (e.g., ""Women are more sensitive than men,"" as well as the less harmful ""Italians eat spaghetti""). Generics can be considered one of the cornerstones of human cognition since they allow us to conceptualize the properties we attribute to categories and thus organize our experience of the world. The most distinctive feature of generics is that they allow for exceptions. For example, ""Birds fly"" is judged true even if there are birds that cannot fly (e.g., penguins); in this case, therefore, the corresponding universal statement (""All birds fly"") is false. Different generalizations tolerate exceptions to varying degrees. Thus, some generic statements might be better paraphrased with ""all,"" others with ""most,"" and others with ""some,"" but—unlike quantified statements—they do not explicitly contain information about the prevalence of the property in the category (i.e., how many members of the category possess the property). Similarly, there is no unambiguous relationship between the prevalence of a property among category members and the acceptability of the corresponding generic as true. For example, the generalization ""Lions have manes"" is accepted even if only male adult lions have manes, but the generalization ""Lions are males"" is rejected. Given these properties, the meaning of generalizations can be considered ""vague,"" and their interpretation can be assumed to be derived by people through world knowledge and pragmatic skills. Most of the experimental studies conducted on generics are cognitively driven and based mainly on contrasting generics with overtly quantified sentences; in other words, quantifiers are used to approximate the vague meaning of generics. In this paper, we investigate the interpretation of generalizations in Large Language Models (LLMs) of the Transformer family, building on psycholinguistic experimental designs (in particular, Leslie et al. and Cimpian et al.). Since comparison with quantification seems to be necessary to decode the meaning of generics, we also used quantifiers. We present three tasks related to different but complementary research questions: 1) Are LLMs biased towards some quantifiers more than others? We computed the probability of several quantifiers appended to a generic statement. This analysis serves as a baseline to understand the probability distribution of quantifiers and if there is any bias towards some of them (for example, a generic overgeneralization effect such as that found in humans by Leslie et al.). 2) Are the hidden representations of generics similar to those of quantified phrases? We extracted the hidden representation of words in generic and quantified sentences and compared their representation pairwise to understand which quantified nominal phrase approximates the meaning of generics better. 3) Are LLMs showing the same prevalence effect as humans? We reproduced the experimental design of Cimpian et al.'s Implied Prevalence task to test whether the presence of the generic as a premise impacts the probability of selected quantifiers. The data and code that we used for the experiments are publicly available.","In this paper, we analyzed the interpretation of generics in Masked Language Models (MLMs) through psycholinguistic experimental designs that exploited quantified expressions to investigate the understanding of generic ones. The first two experiments raise questions about the codification of quantifiers, as it seems that the models do not substantially exhibit a strong sensitivity to quantifiers and do not encode a semantic difference in the representation of quantification. Altogether, our results suggest that the models do not appear to contain the commonsense knowledge required to interpret generics that differ in content through quantifiers. However, they seem to have encoded a meaning associated with the generic form, which leads them to reshape the probability associated with various quantifiers when the generic sentence is provided as context. In the last experiment, we observed that the models prefer the universal quantifier unanimously if preceded by a generic utterance. People behave similarly when tested on novel categories, that is, non-word categories for which subjects have no prior understanding. However, people can modulate their interpretations of generalizations in a real language setting through their world knowledge of real categories. Regardless, MLMs tend to treat real and invented categories equally, being agnostic to world knowledge. For this reason, this could be a potentially harmful bias. The presented analysis has theoretical and methodological implications. First, we observed that the language of generalization is a complex phenomenon that is hard to investigate in human processing and even more in LLMs, mostly because the investigation of generics' interpretation makes use of quantifiers, and language models often fail in tasks related to quantification. Another problem lies in the fact that it is difficult to test autoregressive models (e.g., GPT family) on tasks such as the one used in Experiment 1 because, as they do not have access to the right context, they do not have sufficient information to modulate the probabilities associated with the various quantifiers accordingly. Finding ways to test autoregressive models in addition to MLMs would be desirable. In this paper, we have not directly investigated the aspect of the attention in MLMs. Future research could address this aspect. Furthermore, future work could involve the definition of alternative tasks for investigating generalizations to make comparing models and human interpretations easier. Psycholinguistic tests on this phenomenon often rely on truth judgments, and we should be cautious about comparing human truth judgments with model outputs since they lack commonsense knowledge comparable to that of humans. Overall, further investigations are needed to clarify the interpretation of generics in language models.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Towards a Universal Dependencies Treebank for Dante Alighieri’s Comedy.,ENG,4,1,1,"Università di Bergamo, Università di Pavia, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore",3,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,"Bergamo, Pavia, Milan","In this paper, we describe the creation in Universal Dependencies of a treebank for Dante’s Comedy, the first syntactically annotated text for Old Italian following a dependency-based schema. We detail the phase of treebanking the first part of the Comedy, the Inferno, and we describe some annotation issues. Then, we perform an evaluation of automated dependency parsing with models trained on the currently available annotated portion of the text.","Over the past two decades, there has been a growing convergence between the world of corpora for ancient languages and the scholarly community working in the area of technologies for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Because of the absence of native speakers and newly written texts, dealing with ancient languages means lacking the possibility of introspective analysis or field inquiries. The only empirical evidence historical linguists can engage with is confined to old texts, many of which are fortunately digitally available today. Enhancing these data sources with meta-linguistic annotation provides scholars with enriched data to support their investigations. Moreover, building annotated sets of textual data for an ancient language following de facto standards is a way to make these old texts compatible with several ready-made NLP tools, as well as to make them comparable with annotated corpora for other (modern) languages. Universal Dependencies (UD) is an annotation framework started in 2015 which aims to provide a universal formalism for dependency-based syntactic annotation, with the goal of facilitating cross-linguistic comparison. Currently, the project boasts 245 treebanks for 141 languages, including historical languages such as Ancient Greek, Latin, Old French, Akkadian, and Classical Chinese. With regard to the Italian language, there are 9 UD treebanks, covering a diverse range of genres, amounting to 879,657 tokens and 37,871 sentences. This paper details the process of developing a UD treebank out of Dante’s Comedy, starting from the annotation of the Inferno, the first out of the three parts (cantiche) of the work. The motivation for this is the current absence of any dependency-based treebank for Old Italian. Besides providing the scholarly community of historical linguistics with a valuable resource, we create gold data that can be used for the supervised training and testing of stochastic NLP tools. This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce Old Italian and the resources available for this language, with a specific focus on the DanteSearch corpus. In Section 3, we describe the creation of the treebank, starting from the Inferno. In Section 4, we describe training and evaluation of a number of models for parsing. Section 5 concludes the paper by summarizing our findings and sketching future work.","Building a UD treebank for Dante’s Comedy is the first step towards incorporating Old Italian among the languages of UD. This paper describes the development of the first part of this treebank, which consists of the first cantica of the Comedy, the Inferno. We also present the results of an experiment of supervised automated dependency parsing using both as training and test sets data from the Inferno. We run this experiment to understand to what extent the process of syntactic annotation of the Comedy, which has been performed so far fully manually, can benefit from the results of the application of an NLP tool. Although the accuracy rates reported in the paper are fairly good (≈77% LAS), in the near future we will have to evaluate how and to what extent they will drop once a model trained and evaluated on the Inferno is applied to a different cantica. Should the accuracy rates drop heavily, even such a negative result might prove helpful in pointing out syntactic differences between the three cantiche. Moreover, the use of other parsers, based on different algorithms and resources (like embeddings), might lead to better and, most importantly, diverging results and errors. As for annotation issues, we will suggest introducing a specific subtype, e.g., ellp, in UD’s documentation, so as to properly identify cases of ellipses, as they are not explicitly captured by the current annotation strategies mentioned in the paper, namely promotion and the use of the relation orphan: the former does not signal the presence of ellipsis, while the latter obscures the real dependency relations which are replaced by it. While adopting a subtype like ellp would make it possible to collect cases of ellipses, their resolution is up to the annotation of so-called enhanced dependencies, which are a kind of advanced annotation that augments dependency labels to facilitate disambiguation. We plan to engage additional annotators with expertise in Old Italian to expedite the process of annotation of Purgatorio and Paradiso. Additionally, we intend to apply error detection processes (like, for instance, those described in [citation needed]) to retrieve possible mistakes or inconsistencies in syntactic annotation. Another task we intend to address is the extension of the UD documentation for Italian in order to make the validator correctly deal with some peculiarities of Old Italian, like for instance enclitic adpositions (e.g., meco ‘with me’), which require the introduction of the feature Clitic=Yes combined with the PoS tag ADP, currently permitted only with the PoS tag PRON. Finally, we plan to include enhanced dependencies in the UD treebank of Dante’s Comedy, once the basic syntactic annotation of the entire work is completed.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks
523_2023,2023,,"Agnese Daffara, Elisabetta Jezek",Towards an Italian Corpus for Implicit Object Completion,ENG,2,2,1,Università di Pavia,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pavia,"This study focuses on the creation of an Italian corpus tailored for the task of Implicit Object Completion. In this corpus, each sentence includes a token [MASK] indicating the position of the Object's head, along with the annotation of a Gold Standard filler word. The task of Object completion is approached as a masked word prediction task, which can theoretically be executed by a BERT-based transformer model. In the next phase of the project, this task will be applied to a variety of Italian language models, and their performance will be assessed. The goal of the project is to provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of these models in successfully completing Implicit Objects within different contexts.","This paper explores the cognitive ability to comprehend verb-argument structures in sentences, specifically focusing on implicit objects. Even when one argument is implicit, individuals can still understand the overall meaning by leveraging the verb's inherent lexical meaning and surrounding context, as suggested by the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954; Firth, 1951). In the context of Natural Language Understanding (NLU), artificial intelligence systems must replicate this cognitive ability to reconstruct events and identify semantic participants, including implicit arguments. To achieve this, we propose that the task of Implicit Object Completion can be approached as a masked word completion task, which is well-suited to transformer-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). This paper outlines the creation of a specialized Italian corpus designed for this purpose, which will also be evaluated in future research. The corpus is based on verbs with Optional Objects—those that can either be implicit or explicit. We divide the corpus into two datasets: an IMPLICIT dataset, which includes sentences with implicit objects, and an EXPLICIT dataset, containing sentences with explicit objects. This distinction allows us to evaluate model performance in two contrasting scenarios: the model's performance when the object is implicit versus when it is explicit. Our hypothesis, influenced by prior research (Ye et al., 2020), suggests that models may perform better when trained on implicit data due to the richer contextual information available. The annotation process for the two datasets differs. In the IMPLICIT dataset, two [MASK] tokens are inserted after the verb or adverb to indicate the position of the missing object, which can be completed by either a single noun or a noun phrase (Determiner + Noun). Each sentence is annotated with a Gold Standard (GS) Noun representing the optimal object head for the [MASK] position. In the EXPLICIT dataset, the explicit object’s nominal head is removed and annotated as the GS. The following example illustrates the annotation: 1. IMPLICIT Dataset: Sentence: Da quel 26 dicembre non vuole più bere [MASK][MASK] né lavarsi. Translation: Since that December 26, they no longer want to drink [MASK][MASK], nor wash themselves. GS Object Head: ""acqua"" (water) Omission Type: LD (lexical deletion) 2. EXPLICIT Dataset: Sentence: Infilo la fetta velocemente nel sacchetto delle fragole e tiro un sospiro, bevo un [MASK] di caffè. Translation: I slide the slice quickly into the strawberry bag and let out a sigh, I drink a [MASK] of coffee. GS Object Head: ""sorso"" (sip) Omission Type: - The dataset will be used to assess the performance of various Italian BERT-based models on the Implicit Object Completion task. We believe that this annotated dataset, combined with subsequent evaluation, will significantly contribute to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in understanding how models handle optional objects and implicit argument filling.","This paper discusses the ongoing development of a corpus designed for the task of Implicit Object Completion, containing sentences with both Implicit and Explicit Objects. The corpus is divided into two distinct datasets to allow separate analysis. In the IMPLICIT dataset, the position for the missing noun or noun phrase (NP) is indicated by manually inserting two [MASK] tokens after the verb or adverb. The corresponding Gold Standard (GS) object head is manually added, considering the sentence context and the typicality of the verb-object collocation, which is quantified using the ItTenTen20 corpus via Sketch Engine. The omission type is also annotated as either Pragmatic Defaulting (depending on contextual cues) or Lexical Defaulting (depending on the lexical verbal root). For the EXPLICIT dataset, the object’s nominal head is identified manually and replaced with the [MASK] token, with the head annotated separately. The next phase of the project involves evaluating the performance of various BERT-based models on the task of Implicit Object Completion. Cosine similarity will be used as the evaluation metric, which measures the similarity between the model’s predicted word and the GS object head. A higher cosine similarity indicates a closer semantic match. An example comparison between two models, bert-base-xxl and UmBERTo (umberto-commoncrawl-cased-v1), is provided for a sentence from the EXPLICIT dataset. In this case, bert-base-xxl predicts ""bicchiere"" (cup), which has a higher cosine similarity to ""sorso"" (sip) than the UmBERTo model's prediction of ""cucchiaino"" (teaspoon). Both models recognize the word as related to a container, but fail to match the intended category of quantity. The results from this evaluation are expected to raise theoretical questions regarding the models' ability to identify the semantic category of objects and cluster words within the same domain. Additionally, the omission type annotations will provide insights into the role of context in reconstructing implicit objects. These findings may guide further research into how NLP models handle implicit argument filling. In conclusion, this project contributes to the development of a unique Italian corpus for Implicit Object Completion, offering a valuable resource for evaluating language models. The comparison of different BERT-based models, evaluation through cosine similarity, and exploration of omission types will provide important insights into how models handle implicit arguments and contextual information, advancing research in NLP and semantic understanding.",1,Language Models

The paper details the RDF modeling of the (meta)data provided by CLaSSES and presents three queries on data from different resources that interact in LiLa.","The Latin language shows a large diversity, in the light of its wide usage in terms both of diachrony (spanning across two millennia) and diatopy (all over Europe and beyond). Such diversity is mirrored in the set of linguistic resources currently available for Latin, ranging from collections of literary texts of the Classical era, to corpora of documentary texts of the Medieval times, dictionaries, and glossaries. Like for many other languages, one limitation that affects the wealth of resources for Latin is their sparseness, which prevents the full exploitation of the data they provide. The LiLa Knowledge Base was built to overcome such limitation, making distributed resources for Latin interact through their publication as Linked Data, by using a set of commonly used vocabularies provided by ontologies for the representation of linguistic (meta)data. Among the resources interlinked in LiLa is the CLaSSES corpus, which enhances the set of lexical and textual data made interoperable by the Knowledge Base with a peculiar kind of non-literary Latin texts (such as inscriptions, writing tablets, and letters) written in different periods and provinces of the Roman Empire, thus contributing to extend the coverage of LiLa with a typology of texts not present so far in the Knowledge Base. This paper details the process of linking CLaSSES to LiLa, and is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the corpus CLaSSES. Section 3 describes the LiLa Knowledge Base.

525_2023,2023,,Maria De Martino,"Processing effort during reading texts in young adults: text simplification, readability assessment and preliminary eye-tracking data",ENG,1,1,1,Università di Salerno,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Salerno,"The paper reports empirical data about the impact of text simplification procedures supported by readability assessment measures on processing effort during reading. Sixty-six Italian native undergraduate students read original and simplified versions of TV news texts and answered a comprehension question. Accuracy data, single word-based and sentence-based measures collected by means of an eye-tracker show that reading simplified texts requires less cognitive demands than their original versions.","Reading is a recent achievement in human evolution, but reading proficiency is considered an important component of success and life outcome. The ability to read and understand with minimum effort depends on both reader characteristics (e.g., literacy, multilingualism, presence/absence of cognitive disorders) and text properties (e.g., length, topic, lexical and syntactic complexity, cohesion, coherence). One approach to improve inclusion by coping with disadvantage in reading skills is to match readers with texts appropriate to their reading abilities. This goal can be accomplished by exploiting readability formulas to predict the reading and comprehension difficulty of a text for a given target audience and, then, to obtain simplified, i.e. easy-to-understand, texts. Different readability formulas are available for several languages. Many of them rely on text linguistic features such as lexical and syntactic features. Lexical features include the values of frequency, familiarity, imageability and age of acquisition of words within a text. Syntactic features include the complexity of syntactic structures such as the incidence of types of clauses and phrases in the text. Both lexical and syntactic features have been shown to impact cognitive demands in reading processes. Hence, more recent readability formulas take into account measures of natural text processing and try to express readability in terms of cognitive processing effort. Actually, reading texts is a complex behavior subserved by automated interactions between different cognitive processes: visual perception, attention, lexical access, working memory, semantic processing. All these processes are involved in the two main aspects of reading: visual information decoding and meaning construction (comprehension). One of the techniques that has been extensively used to study the reading behavior is the recording of eye movements. During reading, the reader’s eyes move from one position to the next in order to process different levels of information that can be extracted from words’ visual form. Psycholinguists assume that eye movements during reading reflect different stages of language processing. Some movement have a perceptual function: saccades are rapid movements that shift the eye’s focus between two fixed points and are necessary to bring the visual information into the zone of the visual field where acuity is best. Other movements have more complex functions. Fixations are short periods of steadiness of the eye on a word and their duration is a marker of the ease of accessing the meaning of the word and integrating this into the current sentence. Regressions are backward-directed saccades and are related to the necessity of the reader to re-analyze previously explored portions of the text because of processing difficulties. Gaze behavior during reading is exploited in several contexts and for different aims both in cognitive psychology and in Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. For instance, eye-tracking metrics are exploited to unfold mechanisms of reading in L2 learners, typical and atypical readers. Corpora of eye-tracking data are available in many languages and are profitably used to implement language models that can predict human reading behavior. A less investigated issue is to what extent the use of specific text simplification strategies reduces the processing effort as measured through eye-movements. The aim of the present study is to test the impact of texts’ simplification and readability assessment on young adults reading behavior through the analysis of eye-movements.","The paper investigates to what extent the application of text simplification strategies improves the readability of texts and reduces the reading processing effort as it emerges from cognitive indexes that are out of the awareness of the reader, i.e. eye movements patterns. The preliminary data reported in the paper show that accuracy in comprehension questions increases significantly when texts undergo simplification procedures based on the reduction of the reader’s amount of processing inferences (i.e., event reordering or coreference chains explaining). On the other hand, the physiological and cognitive measures related to the processing effort during reading are affected by simplification strategies that involve both the lexical-syntactic level and the content level. Moreover, the metrics collected at the sentence-level and single-word level are found to be suitable and sensitive measures to detect respectively the efficacy of simplification procedures in modulating the strategic controlled processes involved in comprehension and the attentional and lexical processing effort during reading. Interestingly, the data were obtained by analyzing the performance of young adult skilled readers that are supposed to be less likely influenced by the readability of texts.",11,Text Simplification
526_2023,2023,,Elisa Di Nuovo,An experiment in error analysis of real-time speech machine translation using the example of the European Parliament’s Innovation Partnership,ENG,1,1,1,Università di Torino,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Turin,"In recent years, technological progress has made Machine Translation (MT) a reality. Significant improvements have been obtained using deep learning models as opposed to rule-based and statistical MT models. Human evaluation still remains under-explored. In 2019, the European Parliament (EP) started an innovation partnership with commercial operators, with the purpose of developing a tool exploiting state-of-the-art, real-time Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and MT technologies to make parliamentary plenary sessions accessible to D/deaf and hard of hearing. In this paper, we present a quantitative and qualitative error analysis carried out on a test set consisting of 78 short speeches delivered by Members of the EP in 19 languages deployed in the EP prototype by November 2022. The taxonomy used for ASR and MT is adapted from the Multidimensional Quality Metrics framework. Results show that sentence segmentation is the biggest issue in the ASR output—not considered using automatic metrics—which often affects the MT output.","In recent years, the landscape of language translation has been fundamentally transformed by remarkable technological advancements. Machine Translation (MT), once an ambitious aspiration, has now become a tangible reality. This transformation has been primarily fueled by the advent of deep learning models, specifically neural machine translation and transformers. These cutting-edge models have ushered in a new era of translation, eclipsing the limitations of traditional rule-based and statistical MT methods. Deep learning models use the mechanism called attention to improve the performance and have been usually evaluated on offline written translation tasks involving a few language pairs. Very recently, research expanded its focus also on speech machine translation, tackled as a concatenation of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and MT, or as an end-to-end task (i.e. direct translation of speech in language A into text in language B). In the last evaluation campaign of the 19th International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2022), one of the eight shared tasks focused on real-time speech translation, addressed as translation of ASR output or directly from the audio source and involving English to German, English to Japanese, and English to Mandarin Chinese. A novelty of this year’s campaign is the addition of manual evaluation of real-time outputs. Like many natural language processing tasks, MT is difficult to evaluate. One of the reasons for this is the nondeterministic nature of translation, i.e. there is more than one correct way to translate from one language into another. Evaluation in shared tasks is usually carried out by means of automatic metrics, BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) being the standard for MT evaluation. This metric tries to overcome the nondeterministic nature of translation using multiple references. However, automatic metrics have several limitations. On the other hand, human evaluation, if carried out using fine-grained guidelines to limit subjectivity, can give a clearer indication of the MT output quality. However, being resource-expensive (i.e., it is hard to find skilled evaluators; skilled evaluators have a high cost), it has been used limitedly and in small studies. To avoid these limitations, crowdsourced annotators have been used. Unfortunately, crowdsourced annotators are frequently inexperienced. As affirm, crowdsourced human evaluation can be used when MT quality is poor, because it can still provide a useful indication; but, as quality improves, it becomes unfit and leads to erroneous claims. In 2019 the European Parliament (EP) started an Innovation Partnership with commercial operators, with the purpose of developing a tool that can perform real-time ASR and MT from and into all the 24 official languages of the European Union (EU). This partnership has the aim of making parliamentary plenary sessions accessible in near-real time to D/deaf and hard of hearing persons. The challenges faced by this project are manifold: the high degree of multilingualism which is highly ambitious considering the technical limits of current MT particularly in a number of low-resource languages, the presence of non-native accents, the large variety of vocabulary/EU jargon required by the numerous specific domains tackled in the plenaries, the low latency constraints to have transcriptions and translations in near-real time, and the required high quality of the output. By November 2022, 19 language models have been developed and made available via a demo interface. These languages are English (EN), French (FR), German (DE), Spanish (ES), Italian (IT), Polish (PL), Greek (EL), Romanian (RO), Dutch (NL), Portuguese (PT), Bulgarian (BG), Czech (CS), Slovak (SK), Croatian (HR), Lithuanian (LT), Finnish (FI), Hungarian (HU), Swedish (SV), and Slovenian (SL). In this paper, we present a quantitative and qualitative study—using Word Error Rate (WER) metric and manual human evaluation—on a test set consisting of short speeches delivered by members of the EP in the 19 languages already deployed in the prototype. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of both ASR and MT output and to reflect on the different insights of the same text given by different annotators. The manual human evaluation is based on an error taxonomy adapted from the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework and applied to part of the test set covering 6 languages (EN, FR, ES, IT, RO, DE). The MQM framework, developed in the EU QTLaunchPad and QT21 projects, provides a hierarchy of translation errors that can be adapted according to the application. We devised our taxonomy consisting of different error categories for ASR and MT and 3 severity levels (i.e., neutral, minor, and major). We decided to exclude critical errors as in [10]. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe the methodology applied for automatic and human evaluation; in Section 3 we report the results quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed per language and per annotator; Section 4 concludes the paper.","We presented a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the tool developed in the context of the European Parliament’s (EP) Innovation Partnership. The evaluation focused on both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT). The quality of ASR was assessed using the Word Error Rate (WER) score, while MT quality was evaluated solely through human manual evaluation. The average WER across a multilingual test set consisting of 19 languages deployed by November 2022 was found to be 6.43%, a very low value. However, it is important to note that WER does not take segmentation issues into account. Human evaluation revealed that sentence segmentation, particularly in languages like Romanian (RO) and Italian (IT), requires refinement. This suggests that WER alone does not provide a comprehensive picture of transcription quality. Human evaluation, while essential, remains subjective. The evaluation process involves categorizing errors, including those related to sentence segmentation. The background of the annotators significantly affects how errors are perceived and identified, and this influence should be further explored. We also found, as noted in previous studies, that the depth of error annotation by different annotators was a key cause of disagreement, especially when they attempted to assess the consequences of the errors. The qualitative results of the human evaluation, focusing on ASR output and its translation into Italian (IT), showed that Spanish (ES) produced the best output, followed by Italian (IT), French (FR), and English (EN), while Romanian (RO) yielded the poorest results. In general, annotators rated ASR output more negatively than MT output. This may be due to annotators’ tendency to emphasize the provided reference transcription of the speech, especially regarding punctuation, which represents only one possible accepted version of the transcribed text. Qualitative findings further indicated that different annotators offered varying assessments of the same speeches, highlighting the necessity for a second round of annotations to reduce disagreement. This second round would help clarify the use of certain error categories, such as ""unintelligible,"" which is often misapplied.",13,Multimodal
527_2023,2023,,"Melissa Donati, Carlo Strapparava",A Cognitive Linguistics analysis of Phrasal Verbs representation in Distributional Semantics,ENG,2,1,1,"Università di Bologna, Fondazione Bruno Kessler",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,"Bologna, Trento","Phrasal Verbs (PVs) constitute a peculiar feature of the English language and represent a challenge for both language learners and computational models because of their complex and idiomatic nature, which has made them appear unsystematic and unpredictable. Recently, Cognitive Linguistics has offered a more systematic explanation of the semantics of PVs by relating their non-compositional meanings to the metaphorical extensions of the particle’s meaning. In order to assess the computational suitability of this approach using Distributional Semantics, we analyzed three different semantic spaces to understand how PVs and particles are represented and whether any of the embeddings capture the significance of particles in the semantics of the entire construction. The results indicate that phrase embeddings are effective in representing the meanings of PV constructions, while word embeddings excel at capturing particle meanings and additionally support the Cognitive Linguistics hypothesis. Since improving the semantic representation of PVs can benefit various NLP applications, further research is necessary to validate these findings.","Phrasal Verbs (PVs) represent a distinctive peculiarity of the English language and are defined as a lexicon unit composed of a verb (e.g., look) and a particle (e.g., out), whose meaning is often non-compositional (e.g., look out means ""to beware"") [1, 2]. PVs comprise a significant portion of the verb vocabulary [3] and are commonly used in everyday language, particularly in spoken and informal contexts [4, 5]. In addition, they are highly productive, with new ones continually being coined to reflect societal changes (e.g., google up) [6]. They are also characterized by their polysemy, with each phrasal verb having multiple meanings on average [5]. To further enhance their complexity, for a long time, linguists and grammarians have claimed that the selection of verb and particle in the PV construction is totally unsystematic and unpredictable [6, 7, 8], therefore the traditional pedagogical approach to PVs has always been based on memorization of the verb-particle combination and the corresponding meaning causing a general discouragement of learners around PVs. Recent research in Cognitive Linguistics, however, has proposed a more systematic explanation of the association between these verb-particle combinations and their apparently randomly assigned idiomatic meaning, by suggesting that it is the particle (in particular its metaphorically extended meaning [9]) that plays a crucial role in shaping the overall meaning of the PV [2]. Given that this approach has shown promising results in language learning [10], and that computational models of language face difficulties that are similar to English as a Second Language (ESL) learners in understanding the semantic complexity of PVs, we wanted to examine whether such a Cognitive Linguistics account holds also from a Distributional Semantics perspective, where the representation of words’ meanings and semantic relationships have repeatedly been proved to be similar to the way they are represented in the human cognitive system [11]. With this aim, we analyzed three different semantic spaces – word embeddings, phrase embeddings, and POS-tagged embeddings – to determine the most accurate way of representing PVs and particles and whether the Cognitive Linguistics hypothesis was accounted for in any of them. The importance of the particle in shaping the meaning of PVs was confirmed, but the results appeared to vary across the different semantic spaces, suggesting the need for further and more detailed research.","The aim of this work was to analyze the distributional representation of PVs from a Cognitive Linguistics perspective. More specifically, we wanted to examine three different semantic spaces (word embeddings, phrase embeddings, and POS-tagged embeddings) using simple vector combination (sum) and mathematical computations (cosine similarity) to evaluate whether: 1) the meaning of the PV construction is properly represented; 2) the particles’ embeddings truthfully capture their meaning; 3) the greater role of the particle in shaping the semantics of the PV, as posited by the Cognitive Linguistics approach, is accounted for. The current results showed that, as expected, phrase embeddings performed best in capturing the complex semantics of PVs, supporting the idea of treating PVs as single tokens when training the embeddings so as to capture the true context of occurrence and obtain more accurate meaning representation that accounts also for the less compositional meanings. As far as particles are concerned, word embeddings outperformed both phrase and POS-tagged embeddings. These results were unexpected because we anticipated better performance from POS-tagged embeddings, which were designed to isolate particle occurrences. We identified different possible explanations for these results, including limitations in integrating POS-tag information (that reduces the number of occurrences) compared to including occurrences with different syntactic functions, the issues related to the general difficulty of representing function words, and also the possibility that words used as particles carry a unique core meaning regardless of their syntactic functions. Further research is needed, along these lines, to disentangle these factors and understand what could be the most effective way to represent particles and function words in Distributional Semantics. Finally, the results of the third and last type of analysis, that was designed precisely to test the Cognitive Linguistics claim on the role of the particle, showed that when separate vector representations are built for particles, i.e., distinguishing the occurrences of the same words with other syntactic functions, as was the case with POS-tagged embeddings, particles do appear to play a greater role than the verbs proper in the semantics of the PVs. Conversely, when the vector representation of particles is less accurate, i.e., includes occurrences of the same words with other syntactic functions, as it was the case with word embeddings, it is the verb proper that appears to be more crucial in the semantics of the PV in most cases. Overall our findings align with the literature, in that they support the idea that vectors for PVs should be treated as single tokens rather than splitting them into individual words [38] and that representing the meaning of particles is challenging, justifying their removal in many NLP applications [46]. However, we believe that understanding how to build appropriate semantic representations for particles is crucial for analyzing their contribution to larger constructions, such as PVs. In order to do so, future studies can explore different types of embeddings and test whether refining POS-tagged embeddings (for example, by weighting each POS-tag feature according to the task or alternatively using Neural Networks for combining these features into a unique meaningful hidden representation) could improve representation accuracy and thus lead to better performance of the models in specific semantic tasks. Last but not least, our results provide initial evidence supporting the Cognitive Linguistics account of PV semantics from a Distributional Semantic perspective, although further confirmation is needed. Adopting the Cognitive Linguistics approach to PVs in education and leveraging NLP applications in this direction can facilitate the acquisition of this complex English structure for ESL learners. Additionally, capturing and representing PV meanings and the semantic roles of their components can benefit NLP tasks involving semantic and morphosyntactic relations (such as machine translation, question-answering, summarization, automatic synonym detection, etc.). For these reasons, we hope this work stimulates further advanced research in this area, leveraging the insights from Cognitive Linguistics and Computational Linguistics.",22,Distributional Semantics
528_2023,2023,,"Marco Gaido, Dennis Fucci, Matteo Negri, Luisa Bentivogli",How To Build Competitive Multi-gender Speech Translation Models For Controlling Speaker Gender Translation,ENG,4,1,0,"Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Università di Trento",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Trento,"When translating from notional gender languages (e.g., English) into grammatical gender languages (e.g., Italian), the generated translation requires explicit gender assignments for various words, including those referring to the speaker. When the source sentence does not convey the speaker’s gender, speech translation (ST) models either rely on the possibly-misleading vocal traits of the speaker or default to the masculine gender, the most frequent in existing training corpora. To avoid such biased and not inclusive behaviors, the gender assignment of speaker-related expressions should be guided by externally-provided metadata about the speaker’s gender. While previous work has shown that the most effective solution is represented by separate, dedicated gender-specific models, the goal of this paper is to achieve the same results by integrating the speaker’s gender metadata into a single “multi-gender” neural ST model, easier to maintain. Our experiments demonstrate that a single multi-gender model outperforms gender-specialized ones when trained from scratch (with gender accuracy gains up to 12.9 for feminine forms), while fine-tuning from existing ST models does not lead to competitive results.","Spurred by growing concerns about fairness in language technologies, research on understanding and mitigating gender bias in automatic translation is gaining traction. The bias of automatic systems is extremely evident when it comes to ambiguous sentences or expressions, where there are no explicit cues in the source content about the correct gender assignment of a referent (e.g., en: The doctor arrived – it: Il/La dottore/essa è arrivato/a). In this setting, the state-of-the-art neural models often choose the masculine forms or perpetuate stereotypical assignments, as they reflect the condition statistically more likely based on their (biased) training data. This situation frequently occurs when the source language is genderless or employs notional gender, expressing gender in a limited set of parts of speech, and the target language follows a grammatical gender system, embedding gender distinctions throughout a broad inventory of parts of speech. Focusing on the case in which the source language is English, a notional gender language, and the target language is Italian, a grammatical gender language, a frequent instance of this condition is represented by first-person references, i.e. by the words and expressions referred to the speaker (e.g., en: I am a young researcher – it: Sono una/un giovane ricercatrice/tore). In this case, text-to-text machine translation (MT) models mostly output masculine forms, while direct (or end-to-end) speech-to-text translation (ST) systems partly rely on the biological cue of the speaker’s vocal traits to assign gender. However, direct ST models are still largely biased toward producing masculine forms, and, most importantly, biological aspects are related to the sex rather than to the gender of an individual. Hence, their exploitation is not inclusive of all people, harming several groups such as transgenders. As a solution, proposed to leverage external metadata about the speaker’s gender to control the gender assignment of words referred to the speaker. Specifically, they investigated two approaches: i) the development of two separate gender-specialized models, fine-tuned on gender-specific data as also proposed later in MT, and ii) a single multi-gender model, where the speaker gender is a tag fed to a single model as in multilingual systems. While the second solution would be preferable (as the specialized solution involves the higher cost of maintaining two separate models), the experiments demonstrate that specialized models outperform the multi-gender approach by a large margin in terms of gender accuracy. In light of the above, in this paper we address the following research questions: i) why do specialized models outperform multi-gender ones? ii) Can we build competitive multi-gender systems? Through experiments on English-Italian translation of TED talks, we show that the low accuracy of multi-gender models comes from the initialization with the weights of a gender-unaware ST system and the inability to override the behavior of the base ST model (i.e., the reliance on vocal cues) during the fine-tuning stage. We also try to address this problem with two solutions: i) a contrastive loss that penalizes the extraction of gender cues from speech input, and ii) altering vocal properties of training data to misalign gender cues with gender tags and gender translations. Despite the slight improvements brought by these solutions in gender accuracy and overall translation quality, none of them effectively close the performance gap with the specialized solution. However, training multi-gender models from scratch yields competitive results, outperforming the specialized approach with gender accuracy gains of up to 12.9 points for feminine translations. Therefore, we recommend building multi-gender models from scratch, while building them on top of existing systems remains an open research question.","In this paper, we studied the effect of different training strategies to build multi-gender ST models, i.e., models informed of the gender of the speaker by an explicit gender tag. Focusing on English-Italian translations, we demonstrated that the low accuracy of multi-gender models shown by previous work stems from their initialization with gender-unaware ST system weights and the inability to effectively override the reliance on vocal cues during fine-tuning. On the other hand, training multi-gender models from scratch proved to be an effective solution, outperforming the approach based on the creation of two gender-specialized models. As training from scratch is not always feasible, we also experimented with two methods to enhance the reliance on the gender tag in fine-tuned multi-gender models: penalizing the extraction of gender cues from speech input and altering the vocal properties of the speakers in the training data to avoid the alignment between biological cues and gender tags and translations. While these solutions partially improved gender accuracy and overall translation quality in fine-tuned multi-gender models, they did not close the gap with specialized models. Therefore, further research is needed in this direction.",21,Gender and Inclusive Language Studies
529_2023,2023,,"Paolo Gajo, Silvia Bernardini, Adriano Ferraresi, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño",Hate Speech Detection in an Italian Incel Forum Using Bilingual Data for Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning,ENG,4,1,0,Università di Bologna,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Bologna,"In this study, we aim to enhance hate speech detection in Italian incel posts. We pre-train monolingual (Italian) and multilingual Transformer models on corpora built from two incel forums, one in Italian and one in English, using masked language modeling. Then, we fine-tune the models on combinations of English and Italian corpora, annotated for hate speech. Experiments on a hate speech corpus derived from the Italian incel forum show that the best results are achieved by training multilingual models on bilingual data rather than training monolingual models on Italian-only data. This emphasizes the importance of using training and testing data from a similar linguistic domain, even when the languages differ.","While there is no scarcity of English-language models and training resources for the detection of hate speech (HS), especially with the recent rise in popularity of this research topic, much work can still be carried out on this problem in other languages. For less-resourced languages, such as Italian, one of the main difficulties of combating this phenomenon is the lack of annotated data. The problem is even more severe when considering the detection of hate speech in niche contexts, such as in forums frequented by incels, short for “involuntary celibates,” a community known for its hateful language and use of specific misogynous and racist lexicon. In particular, it seems no work has yet been done on the detection of hate speech in Italian incel forums. In this paper, we present a simple approach to improve the performance of hate speech detection models in Italian forums frequented by incels. Our contribution is two-fold: (i) Masked language modeling. We adapt monolingual Italian models to the linguistic domain of Italian incel forums by training them on the masked language modeling (MLM) task. As training material, we use an unlabelled corpus compiled from an Italian incel forum. We also adopt an existing multilingual model, already domain-adapted to the incel domain in both English and Italian. We release these novel models, which can be used for further research on the topic. (ii) Hate speech detection. We fine-tune the vanilla and domain-adapted models on the downstream task of detecting hate speech in Italian incel posts. Monolingual models are trained on Italian-only combinations of corpora binary-annotated for hate speech, while Italian–English combinations are used for the multilingual models. Testing the performance of the models on a labelled hate speech corpus, obtained by annotating posts from the Italian incel forum, shows that the best results are obtained by first training the base multilingual model on bilingual data taken from both the Italian and English incel forums, using the MLM task, and then fine-tuning it on combinations of Italian and English corpora, annotated for hate speech. In the approached scenarios, pre-training and fine-tuning on bilingual in-domain incel annotated data may therefore be more effective than training on general target-language labelled corpora, despite part of the training data not being in the language of the downstream task. In addition, the results show that this strategy can be used to improve model performance when in-domain target-language data is scarce, by using in-domain data from other languages. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work on hate speech detection in Italian and English, as well as multilingual approaches to the problem. Section 3 describes the corpora used in this study. Section 4 presents the employed models. Section 5 describes the experiments conducted and discusses the results. Section 6 closes the contribution with conclusions and future work.","In this paper, we have presented an approach to improve the performance of hate speech detection models in Italian incel posts. Our experiments show that domain-adapting transformer models to the contents of incel forums boosts their performance when predicting the hatefulness of incel forum posts, both when using Italian-only and multilingual models. The increase in performance obtained through MLM pre-training is particularly high when using bilingual training data with mBERTbase, which might indicate that the model is learning about incel hate speech by learning language-agnostic incel concepts. We have also shown that for the base Italian models (AlBERTo and UmBERTo) fine-tuning on combinations of different Italian corpora can lead to a boost in performance. However, this performance boost is nullified after MLM pre-training, which appears to be a more effective strategy for improving the performance of the models. When looking at racism vs. misogyny identification in posts extracted from Il forum dei brutti, the former appears to be much easier to detect. This seems due to the fact that racist language is much more explicit than misogynous language in the scrutinized forum, but further research is needed to ascertain such a supposition. In future work, we plan to experiment with different resources for MLM pre-training, using corpora in different languages, since it seems multilingual models such as mBERTbase are capable of learning about hate speech in a language-agnostic way from multiple languages. In addition, with more computational resources, larger corpora and more training epochs could be used to further improve the performance of the models. Lastly, further experiments can be carried out as regards the performance of the scrutinized models on the individual sub-tasks of misogyny and racism identification, respectively.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

An overview of the Dictionary and of the architecture of the LiLa Knowledge Base is first provided; then, the stages of the process of linking the Dictionary to LiLa’s collection of lemmas are described. In conclusion, a query illustrates how interoperability allows for full exploitation of Latin resources.","Latin benefits from a wealth of resources, making it one of the more privileged historical languages in terms of available linguistic data. However, the scattered nature of these resources across separate repositories hinders full access to the breadth of information they contain. To address this, the CIRCSE Research Center in Milan, Italy, launched the LiLa - Linking Latin project (2018-2023), with the aim of creating a Knowledge Base that enables interoperability among all Latin linguistic resources by adhering to the Linked Open Data (LOD) principles. These principles include using URIs for identification, making them accessible via HTTP, providing useful information upon lookup, and including links to other URIs for further discovery. The LiLa Knowledge Base already covers a broad range of interlinked resources, especially for Classical Latin. This is exemplified by the LASLA corpus, comprising 130 Classical Latin texts, and the Lewis and Short dictionary. The Knowledge Base also extends into later Latin stages, with resources like the Index Thomisticus Treebank, which includes works by Thomas Aquinas, the UDante treebank for Medieval Latin texts by Dante, and the Computational Historical Semantics Corpus, which covers canonical works like the Decretum Gratiani from the 12th century. Despite LiLa’s temporal breadth, it currently lacks spatial diversity, with no resources linked from Eastern European regions where Latin was historically used. To bridge this gap, the project sought to integrate the Dictionary of Medieval Latin in the Czech Lands, which compiles Latin vocabulary as used in the Czech region during the Middle Ages (1000-1500 CE). This dictionary, centered on a specific region and time period, presents valuable variability in both temporal and spatial dimensions, enhancing LiLa's lemma collection and its capacity for linguistic diversity. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the architecture of the LiLa Knowledge Base, Section 3 provides details on the Dictionary, Section 4 explains the linking process between the Dictionary and LiLa, and Section 5 illustrates the benefits of interoperability in LiLa by presenting a sample query using the newly linked Dictionary data.","Linking the Dictionary of Medieval Latin in the Czech Lands to the LiLa Knowledge Base marks a significant step forward in maximizing the potential of linguistic resources for Latin by promoting their interoperability. This integration enhances the degree of linguistic diversity represented within LiLa, particularly in three key areas that are especially relevant to Latin, a language that spanned centuries across Europe: (a) diachronic diversity, as the Dictionary captures a portion of Latin vocabulary used during the Medieval period; (b) diatopic diversity, by incorporating Latin terms specific to the Czech lands; and (c) domain-based diversity, as the Dictionary frequently includes specialized terms from fields like flora and fauna. The inclusion of these lemmas substantially enriches the LiLa Lemma Bank, both in terms of the quantity and quality of entries, emphasizing the value of linking non-standard Latin varieties to the Knowledge Base. In the near future, further steps are planned to finalize the linking process. This will involve disambiguating ambiguous matches, adding missing lemmas to the Lemma Bank, and incorporating referencing lemmas in addition to full entries. Additionally, efforts will be made to model citations of attestations—references to other dictionaries and sources of example usages. The next phase of the project also aims to connect relevant documents from the same geographic region and time period as the Dictionary, such as those from the Czech Medieval sources in the AHISTO project. However, these documents are currently available only as raw texts and will require lemmatization before they can be integrated. Given the distinct nature of the local Latin variety, influenced by the Czech language and enriched with regional proper names, lemmatization using existing trained models is expected to yield low accuracy. This further highlights the importance of collecting non-standard Latin data and examining how different varieties of Latin may vary in their structure and use.",5,Latin Resources

We further investigate the use of three state-of-the-art generative text models to create variations of claims in zero-shot settings as a data-augmentation strategy for the identification of previously fact-checked claims. Our results indicate that models struggles in varying the surface forms of the claims.","The pollution of the information ecosystem by misleading or false information has reached unprecedented levels globally. This phenomenon has been fueled by several factors, including the collapse of local and national journalism, growing distrust in science and evidence-based facts, and the rise of computational amplification tools like bots. Manually fact-checking claims is an expensive and time-consuming process, and in many cases, it comes too late. Research has shown that false and inaccurate information spreads online eight times faster than true and reliable information. Allowing this kind of information to circulate freely can have harmful consequences for individuals and groups, and it threatens the fabric of democratic societies. Therefore, it is crucial to implement automatic solutions that can assist content moderators and information professionals in responding quickly to false or misleading information. The full fact-checking verification pipeline involves several steps: (i) assessing whether a claim is worth fact-checking, (ii) checking whether the claim has already been fact-checked, (iii) gathering evidence from reliable sources to evaluate the claim's veracity, and (iv) assessing its truthfulness. Having access to a database of previously fact-checked claims is a valuable resource because claims often get repeated with minor variations, especially by politicians. This resource can save time and mitigate the effects of misinformation. This paper introduces CheckIT!, the first corpus of previously fact-checked claims for Italian. Currently, CheckIT! consists of 3,577 claims from 317 Italian politicians and public figures, each annotated with evidence and veracity labels. The main contributions of the paper include: (i) the introduction of CheckIT!, a fact-checking resource that addresses a gap in Italian-language resources for claim verification and misinformation detection; (ii) a feasibility study on automatic paraphrasing in Italian, exploring the use of advanced NLP techniques for generating high-quality texts that preserve the original meaning of claims while introducing linguistic variations; (iii) the proposal of an initial framework for the automatic extension of fact-checking resources, allowing CheckIT! to continuously grow with additional fact-checked claims and related evidence.

We conducted a preliminary investigation of three state-of-the-art automatic text generation tools for paraphrasing claims. By combining multiple automatic measures, it appears that ChatGPT and mT5 are the two best candidates for further exploration, while Camoscio presents non-trivial issues regarding failure to produce output and variations in the generated texts. Future work will focus on three areas: conducting a qualitative (human-based) evaluation of the two best models; evaluating the generated paraphrases for previously fact-checked claim retrieval, following the approach in [5]; and finally, assessing the generated paraphrases against the topics.",15,Fact Checking and Fake News Detection
532_2023,2023,,"Claudiu Daniel Hromei, Danilo Croce, Roberto Basili",End-to-end Dependency Parsing via Auto-regressive Large Language Model,ENG,3,0,0,Università di Roma Tor Vergata,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Rome,"This paper presents a straightforward application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Dependency Parsing. The parsing process is approached as a sequence-to-sequence task, where a language model takes a sentence as input and generates a bracketed form, allowing for the deterministic derivation of the dependency graph. The experimental evaluation explores the feasibility of utilizing LLMs for this purpose, while also assessing the process’s sustainability with modest parameter sizes (training on a single GPU with limited resources) and investigating the impact of incorporating multilingual data during training. The results demonstrate that an end-to-end dependency parsing process can indeed be formulated using a task-agnostic architecture.","Dependency parsing is a crucial component of natural language processing that plays a significant role in capturing the syntactic intricacies within sentences. The primary objective of dependency parsing is to establish dependency relations among words. This allows humans to understand how words are connected and how they depend on one another in the sentence’s structure. Such understanding is instrumental in a wide range of applications, including semantic interpretation, machine translation, relation extraction, and various other linguistic tasks. One notable parsing technique is the shift-reduce method, as exemplified in. This parser processes sentences from left to right, word by word while maintaining a buffer for words that are yet to be fully processed. Other approaches have been proposed, based on machine learning techniques, such as the biaffine neural networks. These networks, based on Bi-LSTMs, have proven effective in capturing complex dependencies between words. Another intriguing parsing approach is UDPipe, focused on parsing with the Universal Dependency Framework. UDPipe stands out because it performs dependency parsing and other essential tasks like tokenization, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatization for multiple languages. UDPipe performs all these tasks without relying on external data. It employs a Bi-LSTM architecture fed with end-to-end, character-level, pre-trained, and contextualized embeddings. The model was trained on an extensive dataset of over a million sentences across different languages to capture cross-lingual relations effectively. The system was later extended as UDPipe+ by incorporating multilingual BERT in its token representations. However, while these methods have achieved state-of-the-art results in various languages, they are tailored specifically for the structure prediction problem based on ad hoc methods. More recently, models based on the Transformer architecture have gained popularity for their ability to perform classification, regression, and rewriting tasks. These models operate on a sequence and they output another sequence. For instance, the work in introduced an end-to-end seq2seq method for dependency parsing, where the model directly predicts the relative position of the head for each word in the sentence. It also utilized a beam search decoder with tree constraints and sub-root decomposition to improve the results. Moreover, in the authors have experimented with a multi-task, multilingual version of BERT. This model was pre-trained on 104 languages and could predict not only dependency parsing trees but also lemmas, part-of-speech tags, and more for each word in an input sentence. One notable Transformer-based architecture is the LLaMA foundational models. LLaMA is a large model with billions of parameters that generates output sequences in an autoregressive manner based on the input and previously generated output tokens. It has been recently applied to a variety of linguistic tasks by instruction-tuning a monolithic architecture to solve them all. In this work, we raise a crucial question about the applicability of models like LLaMA for predicting tree-like structures. Specifically, we seek to explore whether such models can be used to define an end-to-end parsing process without relying on architecture choices that are task-dependent. We envision a system that, given an input sentence, predicts an output sequence in a parenthetical form as in. This output sequence allows for the reconstruction of the dependency tree of the original sentence. The experimental results on three Italian treebanks demonstrate that such an approach is not only feasible but also capable of achieving results comparable to the state-of-the-art while requiring minimal training resources, such as training on a single GPU with modest memory. In the rest of the paper, Section 2 described the proposed approach, Section 3 presents and discusses the experimental evaluations, while Section 4 derives the conclusions.","In this paper, we investigate the application of recent popular LLMs, specifically the LLaMA foundational models, to address the Dependency Parsing problem. Our exploration aimed to answer three key questions: Can we utilize LLaMA in a sequence-to-sequence scenario to rewrite Dependency Parsing Trees from input sentences? The answer is affirmative. Although LLaMA did not achieve a new state-of-the-art performance, our results demonstrate that the adopted model and approach are competitive with UDPipe, the current leading model. Can we scale up LLaMA by increasing the number of parameters while ensuring sustainability? Our evaluation reveals that almost doubling the model’s parameters leads to little or no significant gain in performance. However, we found a notable performance increment by leveraging the beam search technique instead of the greedy search. This aspect could be explored further in the future. Does the inclusion of multilingual data improve the LLaMA model? Our findings in this paper support the initial hypothesis that using multilingual data enhances the LLaMA model’s performance. Every model trained with multilingual data consistently outperforms those trained solely on Italian data. As a future work, it would be interesting to exploit data from all available languages and evaluate the model’s capabilities across a broader linguistic spectrum. This approach could lead to the development of a Universal Dependency Parsing Model as a unified architecture, which holds significant promise in advancing the field of dependency parsing.",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

This means that datasets where the annotations are aggregated by majority voting are not enough. In this paper, we present an Italian disaggregated dataset concerning hate speech and encoding some information about the annotators: the DisaggregHate It Corpus. The corpus contains Italian tweets that focus on the topic of racism and has been annotated by native Italian university students. We explain how the dataset was gathered by following the recommendation of the perspectivist approach, encouraging the annotators to give some socio-demographic information about them. To exploit the disagreement in the learning process, we proposed two types of soft labels: softmax and standard normalization. We investigated the benefit of using disagreement by creating a baseline binary model and two regression models that were respectively trained on the ‘hard’ (aggregated label by majority voting) and the two types of ‘soft’ labels. We tested the models in an in-domain and out-of-domain setting, evaluating their performance using the cross-entropy as a metric, and showing that the models trained on the soft labels performed better.","The rise of the Internet and social media platforms has given many users the opportunity to express their opinion online. Unfortunately, this leads to the diffusion of a new online phenomenon: hate speech. To prevent the viral spread of these expressions on social media, hate speech detection has become a popular task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). A lot of tools have been created to detect and counter hate speech. Recently, there have been studies suggesting shifting away from the golden standard approach in Machine Learning, especially in tasks that are partly subjective and influenced by the social and cultural context, such as hate speech. These works advocate that different opinions given in the annotation process are not a noise factor but can be used to create better systems. This shift has inspired scholars to explore different techniques to train models using datasets where the target label is not simply determined by majority voting on the annotations. In this line, two theoretical paradigms have been established, both focusing on the inclusion of different perspectives: learning from disagreement and perspectivism. The former can be considered a ‘soft perspectivist approach’ because it takes into account the presence of disagreement in the annotated data, while the latter overcomes the idea of “ground truth” in dataset construction and in the creation and evaluation of NLP models, focusing more on who the annotators are. Our work can be seen as an attempt to approach hate speech detection by exploiting the possible disagreement among annotators. Usually, models are trained on data associated with a ‘hard’ label. In binary classification, each item is assigned a label, either 0 or 1. The hard label value is commonly obtained through majority voting, meaning that controversial instances have the same label as those where all annotators agree. This may lead to a loss of valuable information that could be used during training. On the other hand, ‘soft’ labels aim to avoid this waste of data by assigning a real number to the label. Different functions, such as standard normalization or the softmax function, can be used to determine the value of the soft label. In this context, we created the DisaggregHate It Corpus, a new disaggregated dataset about hate speech in the Italian language that includes some socio-demographic information about annotators. A corpus like this could be beneficial in exploring how different segments of the population are sensitive to social issues like hate speech and how this information can be leveraged to create better systems. After explaining the characteristics of the dataset in Section 3, we validate the corpus by using it as the training set for different models in Section 4. The experiments show that training models on a soft label rather than a hard label leads to better results. As suggested by previous research, we used cross-entropy as a metric for evaluating the models.","In this work, we presented the DisaggregHate It Corpus, a new disaggregated dataset in the Italian language for hate speech detection. To our knowledge, it is the first dataset released with disaggregated labels, incorporating socio-demographic information about the annotators. Upon computing the agreement among annotators with similar profiles, we found that the Krippendorff’s α was very low. Additionally, by pairing this information with the number of ties obtained through majority voting, we observed that disagreement is a significant factor in the corpus. This insight motivates the need for hate speech detection models that can capture the different opinions of human annotators. To address this, we experimented with the use of soft labels, exploring two methods of computing these labels: standard and softmax normalization. To further investigate the role of disagreement in model learning, we carried out experiments testing the performance of our models in two specific settings: in-domain and out-of-domain. We created a binary model based on hard labels and two regression models trained on the soft labels computed using the two normalization methods. Inspired by previous works, we evaluated the models by computing the cross-entropy between the soft labels of the annotations and the model predictions. The results showed that the regression models performed better in both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets. This indicates that using soft labels helps to integrate the disagreement among annotators into the models, aligning them more closely with the distribution of opinions among human annotators. Based on these findings, we plan to extend the study by using the same DisaggregHate It Corpus to explore a stronger perspectivist approach. This would involve modeling the perspectives of different groups of annotators based on their socio-demographic traits or other commonalities, further enhancing the ability of models to reflect diverse viewpoints.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Nevertheless, the rich information carried by patients’ speech and voice is only partially used for diagnosis and clinical decision-making, which is currently based on holistic ratings of speech intelligibility. An accurate diagnosis could be supported by the application of fully automated analytic methods and machine learning techniques on speech recordings. However, most of the proposed procedures were designed for highly functional but “artificial” vocal paradigms, such as sustained phonation, and consider all the considerable amount of features that can be extracted using automatic systems. In this work, we perform PD detection trials using features extracted from connected speech rather than isolated speech units. Moreover, we support the adopted machine learning-based methods with linguistic considerations to reduce the number of features to some meaningful ones. The main findings highlight that this procedure allows for more accurate, economical, and, most importantly, interpretable discrimination.","Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder and the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide after Alzheimer disease. It affects more than 2-3% of the population aged 65 and over. Caused by the deterioration or loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of basal ganglia, PD is generally diagnosed based on clinical criteria, using a medical individual’s history and a physical/neurological exam. The loss of dopamine in the central nervous system, along with the anatomical and physiological changes related to the disease, has an impact on laryngeal, respiratory, and articulatory functions of Persons with PD (PwPD). Alterations in speech and voice are in fact among the earliest symptoms of PD, which results in a motor speech disorder called hypokinetic dysarthria. Nevertheless, the rich information carried by patients’ speech and voice is only partially used for diagnosis and clinical decision-making, since the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a standardized rating tool used to assess the severity and progression of the pathology, only presents one item (item 3.1) that concerns the evaluation of speech. This item is based on the clinician’s perception and mostly considers speech in terms of intelligibility. A deeper understanding of speech and voice phenomena through advanced data analytics methods could therefore be very useful in both the diagnostic phase and in the monitoring of therapy response in PwPD.","The present study provides relevant findings both for the development of PD detection systems and the analysis of Parkinsonian speech characteristics by integrating computational methods with domain-specific linguistic knowledge. The correlation data between the UPDRS ratings concerning PD speakers’ speech ability and the acoustic features automatically extracted from the speech signal corroborate the observation that the specialists’ holistic assessment overlooks, or at least only partially and indirectly considers, acoustic features, which, nonetheless, prove to provide crucial information for the diagnosis. In fact, the speech signal is affected by the condition of the muscles involved in phonation. So, if the vocal apparatus is somewhat compromised as an effect of the muscular impairment due to the disease (dysarthria), the signal should show this. Hence, the relevance of including acoustic features in the assessment of the outbreak and severity of PD. However, fully automated extraction and treatment of speech acoustic features is usually achieved with highly complex systems whose interpretation is quite difficult for both computational scientists, who might be not familiar with PD symptoms and the linguistic value of the features of the speech signal, and for domain experts, who might not be familiar with machine learning methods. Therefore, the design of models in a way that their predictions can be explainable and easily interpretable may actually be most sensible and economical. In fact, this study highlights that not all the possibly considerable acoustic features provide the same amount of information and are actually relevant for discrimination. Moreover, their contribution may vary as a result of the type and span of the linguistic unit used for the feature extraction. More specifically, the classification results show that considering vowel intervals as units of reference for the features extraction is already quite effective. Most effective is, however, considering wider contexts as provided by the inter-pausal phonetic chain intervals, whereas enlarging the vocalic intervals only to the previous consonant (CV intervals as a basic unit) turns out to be noisy rather than informative. Then, on average, the feature subset proved to be most informative, carrying out sufficient information to let the classifiers reach a reasonable detection rate in the considered medical scenario. In particular, the subset mainly includes features concerning spectral distribution, followed by those involving energy and amplitude and finally frequency features (MFCC above all). It is worth noticing that the study has been conducted on continuous speech rather than on isolated phones, syllables or words, to get closer to the normal working dynamic of the vocal apparatus during utterance phonation and avoid artificial effects that may arise when producing single short items. To conclude, supporting automated analytic methods and machine learning techniques with linguistic considerations allows for more accurate, economical and, most importantly, interpretable discrimination. Future work will be devoted to delving deeper into the linguistic analysis of the way the emergent features characterize PD speech and the investigation of the explainability of classification methods based on deep neural networks.",13,Multimodal

LIS2SPEECH is an ongoing project by Orbyta Tech s.r.l. to build a complete translation chain from LIS to speech. The idea is to build a free software framework to transform video containing LIS sentences into Italian vocal sentences. In this way, LIS signers can indirectly produce Italian vocal sentences. In this paper, we describe two milestones for LIS2SPEECH, which are: i. the development of some deep neural models trained by using data augmentation techniques, and ii. the construction of a new dataset for LIS to Italian. Referring to the first point, a number of deep learning models were developed and tested. Then, data augmentation was performed by using some geometric transformations on the videos belonging to the original training set. With reference to the second point, we constructed the TGLIS-227 dataset by using video and audio segmentation techniques, starting from a corpus of RAI newscasts. This dataset is a novelty in the current research panorama as there are no public datasets for LIS with sentence-level granularity.","In this paper, we present the architecture of a real-time translation system from Italian Sign Language (henceforth LIS) to Italian speech. An ideal system platform for this task should be composed of three main modules: - a first module which, starting from an input video, returns the glosses contained in the video. So, this module performs a Sign Language Recognition Task. - a second module that translates the glosses into the Italian language. So, this module performs a Sign Language Translation task. - a third module for the text-to-speech system, that is for pronouncing the sentences in Italian. So, this module performs a Text to Speech task. The task of Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is a classification task that allows to automatically obtain the glosses corresponding to the signs performed by a signer in a video. In general, the SLR is approached as a multiclass classification problem, i.e. a type of supervised learning which, on the basis of a (statistical) model, can associate the correct gloss among the k, where k is the cardinality of the LIS dictionary considered. In the specific settings of the LIS2SPEECH project, the input is a sequence of signs encoded in a video while the labels are the corresponding glosses. So, this is a case of supervised learning, where the models are trained on a dataset containing numerous examples (signs) labeled with the relative class (gloss). Considering the module for translation from LIS to Italian, this implements a task where it is true that the rule ""more data is better data"". In this paper, we follow this prescription in two distinct directions. In Section 2, we describe a number of experiments with deep neural models trained by using a data augmentation technique. We enlarge the possibility given by a relatively small initial dataset by using a number of geometrical transformations to the original videos. We describe these transformations and experiment their impact on the performances of the Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) task, i.e. when each video contains a single sign. Moreover, in Section 3, we describe the initial steps toward the release of a new dataset for LIS in the news domain. We provide a description of the algorithmic process used to provide a sentence-level segmentation of the original videos. In Section 4, we summarize the contributions of this paper and provide a brief description of the ongoing work.","In this work, we have presented two main results obtained in the LIS2SPEECH project. First, we have described the application of a number of data augmentation techniques to some deep neural models in the task of ISLR. We proved with experiments that some of these transformations have a strong impact on the final performance of the classification task. Second, we built the TGLIS-227, a new sentence-level dataset for LIS, applying a new procedure for the automatic segmentation of the newscasts. In future work, we intend to develop the following two ideas: 1. to annotate TGLIS-227 video with the glosses that they contain; 2. to develop a system like Common Voice [17] to collect more data to build an open-source dataset for LIS; Moreover, a more challenging development could be to encode additional two video features that are: the lips and facial expressions. Finally, we noted that very often in the news the signers ""read"" the gloss by using their lips and, moreover, express an emotion related to the gloss by using their facial expression.",13,Multimodal

The evaluation of word alignment systems relies heavily on manually-curated datasets, which are not always available, especially in mid- and low-resource languages. In order to address this limitation, we propose XL-WA, a novel entirely manually-curated evaluation benchmark for word alignment covering 14 language pairs. We illustrate the creation process of our benchmark and compare statistical and neural approaches to word alignment in both language-specific and zero-shot settings, thus investigating the ability of state-of-the-art models to generalize on unseen language pairs. We release our new benchmark at: LINK.","Word alignment is the computational task of identifying translation correspondences at word and multi-word levels between parallel sentences. Historically, word alignment played a crucial role in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). However, while SMT has been replaced by end-to-end neural architectures that attain considerably higher performances, word alignment – also thanks to novel neural approaches – still plays a crucial role in many other NLP tasks, such as lexicon injection and, most importantly, cross-lingual annotation projection. For instance, Procopio et al. recently proposed a state-of-the-art approach to cross-lingual label projection based on word alignment, which allows high-quality sense-tagged datasets to be produced automatically. Furthermore, word alignment has also been leveraged effectively to create silver datasets, not only for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) but also for other semantic tasks, such as Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), thereby addressing the knowledge acquisition bottleneck, especially when dealing with mid- and low-resource languages. While, on the one hand, current architectures for word alignment are achieving increasingly better performance, on the other hand, the lack of high-quality manual data in multiple languages significantly limits their potential and scalability. With a view to addressing the aforementioned drawbacks, our contributions are as follows: 1. We propose a fully manually-annotated evaluation benchmark for word alignment with a total of 14 language pairs, each composed of English and one of the following languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, and Swedish. 2. We experiment with statistical and neural approaches to word alignment and evaluate them against our newly created benchmark. 3. We demonstrate that the concatenation of our novel datasets can be exploited effectively to train a neural approach that generalizes on unseen languages in a zero-shot setting, thereby addressing the lack of training data in low-resource languages.","In this work, we introduce XL-WA, a novel evaluation benchmark for word alignment in 14 language pairs.

An Inquiry Into Diachronic Semantic Shifts in Italian and Spanish,ENG,3,1,0,Università di Trento,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Trento,"An increasingly prevalent approach to studying the gradual change of word meanings over time involves using distributional semantics, which is based on neighboring words. This study combines methods from Hamilton et al. (2016) [1] and Uban et al. (2019) [2] to analyze deceptive cognate pairs in historical and contemporary Italian and Spanish corpora. By employing fastText word embeddings and various similarity measures, it aims to investigate the change of word meanings and test two laws of regularity proposed by Hamilton et al. (2016) [1], along with a new hypothesized regularity in language change regarding analogy. The findings show a coherent evolution of deceptive cognates across the two languages. However, no meaningful correlation is found regarding the two aforementioned laws. Nevertheless, the results of the hypothesized regularity offer valuable insight into how the context of word usage shifts along with the word.","In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studying the shift of word meanings over time, with word embeddings emerging as a valuable tool for this purpose. Hamilton et al. (2016) [1] conducted research focusing on diachronic word embeddings to uncover specific statistical laws associated with semantic change. They examined the law of conformity, which suggests that words tend to change inversely to their frequency. Additionally, they explored the law of innovation, which proposes that words with greater polysemy tend to undergo semantic changes more frequently, regardless of how often they are used. The findings confirmed the hypothesized statistical laws. The study primarily focused on English, aligning word embeddings from different time periods and measuring semantic similarity using cosine similarity. Dubossarsky et al. (2017) [3] contested the validity of the reported laws of semantic change based on word representation models. Replicating previous studies, they found that the law of conformity and the law of innovation did not withstand the more rigorous standard. The negative correlation between word frequency and meaning change was weaker than previously claimed, and the positive correlation between polysemy and meaning change was largely dependent on word frequency without independent contribution. Similarly, to Hamilton et al. (2016) [1], Uban et al. (2019) [2] investigated semantic divergence across languages by examining deceptive cognate sets, which are words with a common origin in different languages. They focused on analyzing modern embeddings to quantify semantic shifts originating from shared etymology, identify false friends (deceptive cognates) in the cognate sets, and measure their score of falseness, namely the dissimilarity between the cognates. The study primarily concentrated on six Romance languages. The authors introduced methodologies such as aligning word embeddings across languages, measuring semantic similarity and divergence between cognate sets, and quantifying the magnitude of semantic changes. Their findings contradict those of Hamilton et al. (2016) [1], who found a negative correlation between frequency and meaning shift. However, they align with their findings regarding the law of innovation.","The hypothesized regularity regarding analogy, a follow-up analysis in this study, has provided intriguing insights into semantic shifts. However, it is important to note that further research into this topic is necessary to validate and expand upon these initial findings. On the other hand, the analyses conducted in this study do not yield definitive results supporting the statistical laws of semantic shifts. Firstly, the RSA evaluation of the embedding spaces revealed that the scarcity of data significantly impacted the quality of the embeddings. Furthermore, while the law of conformity agrees with previous literature in a general trend, such as Hamilton et al. (2016), our study identified a contrasting trend for the law of innovation. This discrepancy in findings may be attributed to the limitation of our study, namely the scarcity of data resulting from the use of relatively short time periods. An additional factor is the relatively short temporal distance between the historic (as recent as 1969) and the modern corpora. Increasing this span is likely to lead to greater shifts, but also to greater data sparsity. Last but not least, the alignment technique employed for matching the embedding spaces could have contributed to the divergent outcomes in the analysis of the law of conformity and the law of innovation. It is noteworthy that both the laws of conformity and the law of innovation conform to the findings of Dubossarsky et al. (2017). Their study revealed that the suggested positive correlation between meaning change and polysemy was primarily influenced by word frequency, and the correlation between word frequency and meaning change is indeed weaker. Here, after conducting partial correlation analysis, a weak correlation was observed. Furthermore, we noticed a high compatibility between frequency and polysemy, indicating an inherent dependence, despite our efforts to disentangle them using partial correlation. Utilizing the fastText model, known for its improved performance on non-English languages, and preprocessing freely available data, the results still highlight poor quality embeddings. This underscores the need for ongoing research and development of word embedding models, alongside the creation of larger, well-curated diachronic corpora. Improving data quality and quantity can enhance the accuracy and reliability of future studies in the field. It is important to note that due to the limitations of the embeddings used in this study, the shifts observed in the inter-language Jaccard distance analysis are relatively small and close to each other. This leads to an extremely high correlation coefficient between the languages being analyzed, which should be interpreted with caution. In addition to the aforementioned directions, other potential areas of research include expanding further in time and broader in the scope of languages. For instance, this could involve going beyond the Romance or even the Indo-European language family to conduct a more comprehensive investigation into language change.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We take the approach of developing curated synthetic data on a large scale with specific properties, using them to study sentence representations built with pretrained language models. Inspired by IQ tests, we create a new multiple-choice task. Solving this task requires a system capable of detecting complex linguistic patterns and paradigms in text representations. We present formal specifications of this task, illustrate it with two problems, and provide benchmarking results.","Current consensus about large language models (LLMs), and neural networks (NNs) in general, is that to achieve better, possibly human-like abilities, we need to develop tasks and data that help us understand their current generalization capabilities and guide their training or tuning toward more complex and compositional skills. Humans are excellent generalizers. A large body of literature has demonstrated that the human mind is predisposed to generate rules from data and combine these rules in ways that are distinct from the activation patterns of neural networks. One possible approach to developing more robust methods is to encourage networks to learn disentangled decompositions of complex observations and the underlying regularities. To illustrate the complexity of rule decomposition, consider complex argument structure relations in the lexicon, such as the Spray/Load alternation in English. This alternation applies to verbs like spray, paint, spread, fill, stuff, and load, which describe covering surfaces or filling volumes. They occur in two subcategorization frames, related to each other in a regular way: the object of the preposition ""with"" is the subject of the onto frame, while the object of the onto prepositional phrase is the subject of the ""with"" frame. For example: 1. ""John loaded the truck with hay."" (AGENT LOCATIVE THEME) 2. ""John loaded hay onto the truck."" (AGENT THEME LOCATIVE) To learn the structure of such a complex alternation automatically, a neural network must identify the elements manipulated by the alternation, their relevant attributes, and the operations that manipulate these objects across multiple sentences. To study the factors that lead to learning more disentangled linguistic representations—those that reflect the underlying linguistic rules of grammar—we take the approach of developing curated synthetic data on a large scale, building diagnostic models from pretrained representations, and investigating the models' behavior. We introduce a new linguistic task inspired by the IQ test RPM (Raven 1938), which we call Blackbird Language Matrices (BLMs). BLMs define a prediction task to learn complex linguistic patterns and paradigms.

This demonstrates that the general formalism can be used to generate datasets with similar formats and specifications. Expanding the covered phenomena can be done systematically, enabling studies that combine or work across multiple phenomena and languages. We believe that this task brings us closer to investigating human linguistic intelligence.","In this paper, we have presented the new BLM task, provided its formal specifications, and illustrated the first instances of BLM problems and benchmarking results with baseline architectures. Current work is focused on developing new dedicated architectures based on Variational Autoencoders and creating new BLM problems.

This is the case for acts and communications of Public Administrations (PA). In Italy, despite institutions repeatedly encouraging clear writing, PA texts have not abandoned the stylistic figures of “bureaucratese.” Suffering the most from the effects of these linguistic choices are speakers with language disparity. In particular, Italian L2 speakers deal with the Italian bureaucracy, for example, to obtain a visa for which A2-level language certification is required. Yet, comprehension of administrative texts is attested only with the C2 level, according to the CEFR.

Then, we used this corpus to test controllable models for text simplification based on Transformers. Although we obtained high results for SARI, we observed that SARI and BLEU alone cannot be used to evaluate text simplification and that a fully reliable automatic metric for the Italian language is still missing. Finally, we asked ChatGPT to simplify one of the sentences in Admin-It-2, obtaining a higher quality simplification than mT5, although the model presents some limitations, especially in reproducibility, and in some cases, in answer accuracy. For future work, we aim at validating Admin-It-L2 involving human annotation, and, more specifically, domain experts and Italian L2 speakers, to properly evaluate the employed models and the quality of their generations. As for the models, we aim to conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each control token. We also would like to adopt a control token to encode the language used in the sentences and employ the corpora in their original versions. Moreover, we aim to create a specific automatic metric to evaluate Italian text simplification. Finally, we would like to test open-source LLMs on administrative text simplification focused on specific target readers, with different prompts, in zero and few-shot settings.",11,Text Simplification

Machine learning and natural language processing techniques made it possible to measure the readability and complexity of the fast-growing textual content on the web. In this paper, we proposed a multi-task learning approach to predict the readability of German text based on pre-trained models. The proposed multi-task model has been trained on three tasks: text complexity, understandability, and lexical difficulty assessment. The results show a significant improvement in the model’s performance in the multi-task learning setting compared to single-task learning, where each model has been trained separately for each task.","Automated text readability assessment is the task of analyzing the difficulty of a piece of text for a target group. Text readability assessment has a wide range of applications, from empowering language learners to find proper reading materials to learn a new language to helping people with disabilities. However, manual assessment of text readability is not an option nowadays due to the fast pace of online content creation on the web. Automated techniques use machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze the complexity of a piece of text and spontaneously assign a readability score to textual contents. Automated text readability is the task of assigning a difficulty level to an input text. The readability score is the mapping of a piece of text (e.g., a short sentence or a paragraph) to a mathematical unit (i.e., text regression) which is the basis of the readability assessment. Text readability assessment could be designed as a text classification or regression task, depending on the input labels. In this paper, we present a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approach based on pre-trained language models for the task of German text readability assessment. We used three metrics that present the readability to train our proposed model. These metrics include complexity, understandability, and lexical difficulty of German texts in the sentence level. Recently, pre-trained large language models showed promising results and could outperform state-of-the-art deep neural network-based models in different NLP tasks either in fine-tuning and feature extraction settings. On the other side, MTL models have had successes not only in NLP tasks but also in speech recognition and computer vision. The proposed MTL model is based on the available readability scores in the TextComplexityDE data set. The data set includes three readability-related scores (i.e., complexity, understandability, and lexical difficulty scores) for 1,000 German text samples. We assumed that the knowledge in the prediction of one of these scores could be used and transferred into the prediction of the others, due to the relatedness of these scores. As a result, we propose an MTL model in which some layers are shared between the tasks. The obtained results from the experiments show that the MTL approach could significantly improve the overall performance of the prediction of all three scores compared to the single-learning setting, where each task has been trained separately. The rest of this paper is organized as follows; Section 2 reviews the recent research on automated German text readability assessment. The TextComplexityDE data set is briefly explained in Section 3. The proposed MTL model and the obtained results on the tasks of text complexity, understandability, and lexical difficulty prediction are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude the paper and discuss the potential future research directions.","In this paper, we proposed a model based on a multi-task learning approach for the task of text readability assessment in German text. The model is trained and tested on the TextComplexityDE data set. It is simultaneously trained on three different readability scores, namely complexity, understandability, and lexical difficulty. Our results showed that the MTL model outperforms the common single-task learning models in all three scores. The obtained results in this experiment reveal the importance of the annotation of text readability from different perspectives. As the direction for future studies, different multi-task learning architectures (e.g., hierarchical architectures) could be tested in the task. Moreover, in this study, we exclusively tested the BERT model to extract features from the input text. However, exploring and assessing the impact and the performance of other pre-trained models is a question for future works. Finally, the performance of fine-tuning approaches of transfer learning can be compared to the feature extraction approach in future studies.",1,Language Models

Prompting Large Language Models for Automatic Text Simplification in Italian,ENG,2,1,1,Università Bocconi,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Milan,"Recent language models (LMs) that follow instructions have showcased remarkable abilities to tackle diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks, given appropriate prompts. However, the potential of these models for Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) in Italian remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer the first in-depth investigation into the capabilities of LMs for performing ATS in Italian. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models on a benchmark Italian ATS dataset of administrative texts, reporting six readability metrics on the generated text. Our findings demonstrate a large variability across models, scales, and prompts. Among the tested models, GPT-3.5 editing capabilities are the most suitable, outperforming, surprisingly, human-written simplification. Furthermore, we shed light on the enigmatic multilingual capabilities of instruction-following models, opening up new avenues for research in this domain.","Italian administrative texts have long been criticized for their complexity, described as “artificial” and “obscure” [1]. Despite efforts by Italian institutions to encourage the use of plain language in official acts and communications over the past decades [2], the readability of these texts remains a pressing issue [3]. To tackle this challenge, considering the substantial volume of bureaucratic text generated, a logical approach is to embark on the analysis and exploration of Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) methods. Automated text simplification is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that aims to modify complex or difficult-to-understand text into simpler and more accessible language while retaining the original meaning. The goal is to make the content easier to comprehend for a wider audience, including individuals with cognitive or reading difficulties, non-native speakers, or those with limited literacy skills. Using recent large-scale language models (LMs) is a promising direction in this context. In particular, recent evidence has shown that high-capacity pretrained models, e.g., T5 [4] or LLaMA [5], can be further improved via instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [6, 7, 8, inter alia]. The resulting model can follow instructions as expressed via natural language, i.e., it can solve many NLP tasks and reply to various user requests with no architectural changes. This paper presents the first investigation to look into the capabilities of instruction-following language models for Automatic Text Simplification on Italian administrative texts. We rely on Admin-It [9], a benchmark parallel corpus in the Italian administrative language that contains sentences that have been simplified using three distinct rewriting techniques. We perform a thorough evaluation of six models based on six different readability measures tailored for Italian. Each model is compared to the readability scores of the original administrative text and the simplified version provided in the parallel corpus. Contribution: We propose the first in-depth study on whether current IFT models can simplify written passages in Italian. We report a large variability across models, with proprietary GPT-3.5 being the most suitable solution. In addition, we introduce a novel metric to better account for accurate and simple generations. We release code and data to facilitate future research.","This paper introduced the first extensive study on the ability of large-scale instruction-following models to simplify Italian administrative sentences. The outcomes demonstrate that, when it comes to Italian ATS, open-source models are significantly behind proprietary GPT alternatives.",11,Text Simplification

The dataset aims to address existing deficiencies in coherence assessment by focusing on human perception of coherence. Recently, it has been integrated into the DiSCoTex benchmark, part of EVALITA 2023, the 8th evaluation campaign for NLP and speech tools in Italian. Our resource aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of coherence, highlighting the influence of both genre and text perturbations on perceived coherence.","Coherence plays a central role in maintaining the overall unity of a text and is influenced by both linguistic and extra-linguistic factors. From the linguistic point of view, it primarily relies on cohesion, which encompasses various linguistic devices used in natural languages to establish connections within a text, such as anaphoric and cataphoric relationships, discourse markers, and elliptical constructions. While cohesion mainly ensures local coherence between adjacent or nearby sentences, to be fully coherent, a text needs to achieve global coherence, a property that pertains to the connection of concepts and relationships that underlie the surface text, ensuring a logical flow of ideas around an overall intent. This aspect of coherence adds a subjective component, as it also depends on the reader or listener’s familiarity with the text, language proficiency, and level of interest and attention. Modeling coherence in natural language is essential for a wide range of downstream applications. One such application is automatic essay scoring in language learning settings, where coherence assessment can provide valuable writing feedback by identifying poorly organized paragraphs and abrupt topic transitions. In clinical contexts, coherence modeling is relevant for automatic language assessment, as speech irregularities indicative of a lack of coherence can serve as markers for mental disorders like schizophrenia. Furthermore, coherence has been adopted as an intrinsic evaluation metric for assessing the quality of texts generated by Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. Additionally, coherence modeling is gaining importance in research on the interpretability of modern deep neural networks. Indeed, while existing work has mainly focused on probing sentence-level properties, understanding how these models encode discourse and pragmatic phenomena remains a crucial aspect. In light of this interest, various attempts have been made to approach coherence assessment in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, especially in the ‘pre-deep learning’ era. With this respect, early computational models of discourse coherence were primarily built upon two linguistic theories: centering theory and rhetorical structure theory. Studies aligned with centering theory focused on analyzing the distribution of entity transitions over sentences as a means to predict text coherence. On the other hand, works inspired by rhetorical structure theory employed discourse parsers to generate discourse relations over sentences. With the advent of neural models, researchers have also explored their application in coherence assessment. The importance of building challenging datasets for coherence evaluation cannot be overstated. With this respect, models of discourse coherence are typically tested on tasks such as reordering, which aim to discern an original text from a corrupted one artificially created by shuffling the order of its sentences, or tasks that require systems to detect whether a document contains an intruder sentence from another document or to classify whether a target sentence is contiguous or not with a given passage. However, these approaches have come under criticism because they neglect key aspects of coherence. They fail to identify the qualities that make the shuffled text incoherent, do not pinpoint the linguistic devices responsible, and overlook the subjective component underlying coherence. Additionally, most existing benchmarks are limited to the English language. Our contribution in this paper is to address some of the existing deficiencies in coherence assessment by presenting a novel resource tailored for the Italian language, designed specifically to study text coherence from the perspective of human perception. The dataset, which to our knowledge is the first for Italian, has been recently used as part of a larger benchmark released for DiSCoTex, one of the shared-tasks presented at the 8th evaluation campaign of NLP and speech tools for the Italian language (EVALITA 2023). The results of first analyses on the resource shed light on the influence of both genre and text perturbations on perceived coherence.","This paper has introduced a novel resource for studying and computationally modeling text coherence in the Italian language, with a focus on human perception. The investigation into genre and text perturbations revealed a significant interplay between the two dimensions. Interestingly, text passages from Wikipedia were rated on average as more coherent than those extracted from TEDx talks, even when presented in a perturbed form. Furthermore, a deeper analysis of the perturbations revealed distinct effects on coherence perception. Modifications that disrupted coherence by altering the sentence order or introducing intruder sentences had varying impacts. Notably, coherence judgments also varied for original texts, and the syntactic structure and complexity-related features emerged as influential factors in human assessment. In the future, we would like to gain deeper insights into the underlying factors that influence coherence perception by incorporating a more diverse range of text genres and perturbations. This deeper understanding of coherence will have significant implications for the development of more sophisticated language understanding and generation systems.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Our study investigates whether the choice of words used to represent classification categories affects the model’s performance, and if there exists a relationship between the model’s performance and the selected words. To achieve this, we fine-tuned an Italian T5 model on topic classification using various labels. Our results indicate that the different label choices can significantly impact the model’s performance. That being said, we did not find a clear answer on how these choices affect the model performances, highlighting the need for further research in optimizing label selection.","In recent years, the Sequence-to-Sequence paradigm has emerged as a highly popular approach in building cutting-edge Transformer-based Language Models [1, 2, 3]. This paradigm draws inspiration from earlier unified frameworks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks [4, 5, 6], treating each task as a text-to-text transformation. In other words, it involves taking text as input and generating new text as output. This unifying framework has proven to be a particularly effective transfer learning method, often outperforming previous models, e.g. BERT [7], in data-poor settings. Furthermore, the recent application and refinement of prompt-based tuning techniques for pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have made this paradigm even more powerful, especially in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios [8]. In such a scenario, several studies have focused on defining methods for the formulation of prompts and the definition of verbalizers, i.e. mapping techniques between model-predicted words and task labels. As for the latter, the vast majority of studies have concentrated on devising automatic or semi-automatic approaches to create verbalizers that can be applied, especially in zero- or few-shot configurations [9, 10, 11]. For instance, [12] proposed Petal, an approach for automatically finding the best words-label mapping by maximizing the likelihood of the training data. [13], instead, developed ProtoVerb, a prototypical verbalizer that learns class prototypes from training data to build verbalizers automatically. Nevertheless, few works have focused on investigating more deeply and systematically the effect that the choice of strings used to represent one (or more) labels has on model performance. Among these, [14] designed different label representations (e.g. canonical task labels, task-unrelated antonyms) and tested their impact with the T5 model on four classification tasks, showing that the performance was generally unaffected by the choice of label representation. Similarly, experimenting with the gender prediction task from the TAG-IT dataset [15], [16] noticed that while modifying the label representations did not affect the performance of the IT5 model [17], shuffling them for the topic classification task led to worse results. In this work, we present an evaluation of the impact of label selection on the performance of a Sequence-to-Sequence Model in a classification task. Specifically, we address the following research questions: i) Do the words used to represent the classification categories influence the model’s performance? ii) Are there any relationships between classification categories and the words used to represent them that we can exploit to do label selection? To investigate these questions, we conducted a series of experiments by fine-tuning the Italian version of the T5 model [17] on the topic classification task [15] using various labels. In particular, we defined different sets of labels and examined the model’s performance for each of these sets. Additionally, we conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis to inspect which labels contribute most significantly to the improvement or decline in classification results and why that might be the case. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2, we present our approach, introducing the data and the model we used (Sec. 2.1 and Sec. 2.2) and the experimental setting (Sec. 2.3). In Sec. 3, we discuss the obtained results, and in Sec. 4, we conclude the paper.","In this work, we presented an evaluation of the impact of label selection on the performance of a Sequence-to-Sequence Model in a classification task. By fine-tuning the Italian version of the T5 model on a topic classification task, we explored various sets of labels and examined their influence on the model’s performance. Our results indicate that the choice of words used to represent the classification categories can have a significant impact on the model’s performance. While some labels led to competitive results, others resulted in suboptimal outcomes, with noteworthy variations in the classification scores. This finding diverges from previous studies that suggested label representations had little impact on model performance. Interestingly, the correlation between the model’s performance and the degree of ""semantic"" distance between the chosen labels and the original ones was not clear. While some labels exhibited statistically significant correlations, they were either positive or negative, indicating that higher or lower semantic similarity did not consistently lead to better performance. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the choice of the label is not a trivial matter and can have a significant impact on the performance of Sequence-to-Sequence Models in classification tasks. To maximize performance, it is essential to explore optimized label selection techniques that are carefully selected and tailored to the specific task and dataset. Future research could focus on developing more sophisticated methods for label selection, taking into account not only semantic similarity but also other relevant factors. Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate the generalizability of these findings across other languages and models, in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of label selection on different NLP tasks.",1,Language Models

The idea, tested for the English language, is to train LLMs by organizing training examples from the simplest to the most complex. Complexity measures may depend on the specific language. Hence, this paper aims to investigate whether CL and the complexity measure can be easily exported to other languages. For this reason, we present a set of linguistically motivated measures to determine the complexity of examples, which has been used in English: these measures are based on text length, rarity, and comprehensibility. We then test the approach on two Romance languages: Italian and French. Our results show that the technique can be easily exported to languages other than English without adaptation.","Transformers-based models have disrupted natural language understanding methods, outperforming previous methods and sometimes even humans in many tasks. Unsupervised learning on huge corpora, regardless of the domain, seems to be the key to increasing performance; however, besides the high costs, there are difficulties with the data. This leads to a significant carbon footprint, which contradicts global sustainability goals. Various approaches are being explored to address the AI carbon footprint problem, ranging from using more carbon-efficient energy sources to applying more efficient AI models and training algorithms. Despite their success, transformers are essentially large memory-based models, necessitating better ways to train them. Bengio et al. proposed Curriculum Learning (CL) as a specific class of efficient training strategies for deep learning models. The naïve approach for training Large Language Models (LLMs), which involves feeding randomly sampled textual batches from the training corpus, is revisited in CL, where the model is refined with a sequence of progressively more challenging examples. This method emulates human learning, starting with simpler concepts and gradually building up more complex ones. Soviany et al. show that CL improves model performance and accelerates convergence. In this paper, we conduct a deep analysis of learning divergencies by training from scratch with BERT and GPT2 on the same corpus in multiple languages. Additionally, we apply our CL-LRC metrics based on length, rarity, and comprehensibility to reduce computational costs and mitigate divergences. Using the same small corpus in three different languages—English (original), Italian, and French (translated)—experimental results show that loss values during training vary across languages. Furthermore, this difference appears to be less pronounced in terms of perplexity scores when pre-training block sizes increase incrementally.","In this paper, we explored the effectiveness of Curriculum Learning (CL) in reducing the cost of pre-training and improving results.

After a thorough analysis, we demonstrated that learning divergence can be mitigated using CL approaches, which were reinforced by measures designed to determine the complexity of examples. These measures, applied during pre-training to sort the corpus based on complexity, yielded outstanding results. While the original approach was tested and validated for the English language, this research aimed to determine whether CL and its associated complexity measure could be applied to other languages without significant adaptation. Experiments conducted in a low-resource environment showed that the proposed method led to better performance, with lower loss during learning and improved perplexity on test data.",1,Language Models

Specifically, we propose an iterative reading-comprehension and reasoning approach to tackle question-answering tasks based on structured data, such as the Text-to-SQL task. In our approach, we define a specialized procedure to extract relevant evidence from structured data and natural language queries, guiding It-LLMs to focus on both the production task and reasoning process. To facilitate this, we introduce a prompting generation procedure that allows It-LLMs to reason about the structural information and natural language queries, ultimately producing symbolic output in the form of SQL queries. Extensive zero-shot experiments with various types of structured data reveal the superhuman abilities of It-LLMs in both comprehension and production, yielding astonishingly accurate answers. However, the models also generate hallucinations and misleading answers, highlighting the limitations of instruction-tuned LLMs and their partial unreliability.","The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been one of the most significant advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP). LLMs, after being pre-trained on immense corpora, have demonstrated superhuman performance on language modeling tasks. Recent advances show that LLMs are capable of zero-shot task generalization, meaning they can adapt to unknown tasks without fine-tuning. In this context, Instruction-tuning has emerged as a promising direction. Instruction-tuning enables LLMs to follow instructions across different tasks and perform well even in tasks they haven’t been explicitly trained for. Instruction-based tuning typically involves either crowd-sourced human tasks or model-generated tasks. While these methods have shown promise, they are limited in both quantity and quality. The scalability of LLMs in various dimensions has demonstrated the potential to overcome the limitations of zero-shot performance, which has led to an increasing focus on the search for high-quality and scalable Instruction-tuning tasks. Despite their success, recent work has highlighted that Instruction-tuned LLMs (It-LLMs) can sometimes generate misleading information that conflicts with factual knowledge, struggle with domain-specific knowledge, and produce hallucinated answers by stretching their generative capabilities. To address these issues, researchers like Zhou et al. have proposed efficient methods for providing optimal prompts, while Jang et al. and Arora et al. have focused on enhancing the models' understanding of the prompts. In this paper, we propose an iterative reading-comprehension and reasoning approach to solve question-answering tasks based on structured data. Specifically, we reframe the Text-to-SQL task within a prompt-based framework and define a specialized procedure for extracting relevant evidence from structured data. The query is then posed to It-LLMs in natural language. This approach directs the models to focus on understanding the prompt, reasoning with the provided information, and generating the output—the SQL code that solves the Text-to-SQL task. Our extensive experiments, conducted in zero-shot scenarios with different types of structured data, demonstrate the remarkable abilities of It-LLMs in both understanding and producing accurate responses in the presence of varying levels of information. However, we also observed errors when the provided information was limited. The results of the zero-shot experiments reveal the shortcomings of It-LLMs, showing their partial unreliability, especially when dealing with harder queries and less informative databases.","In this paper, we propose an iterative reading-comprehension and reasoning approach to solve question-answering challenges of the Text-to-SQL task.

We discovered that even with minimal information about the database, It-LLMs can generate natural language query translations that yield correct and executable SQL queries by just prompting them. Nevertheless, it became evident that reducing the amount of information provided could lead to the generation of incorrect queries. Expanding the scope of our investigation, we believe it would be worthwhile to conduct similar experiments with other It-LLMs. Such comparisons could help determine whether the common phenomena observed in both tested models result from a coincidence or represent aspects to further investigate in studying these new technologies. In conclusion, this research underscores the substantial advancements offered by It-LLMs in the realm of Text-to-SQL translation while also highlighting the implications of choosing whether to provide more or less information during the prompting process.",1,Language Models

We present a set of guidelines for the annotation and reformulation of gender-(un)fair texts and their application to a corpus of 1,024 portions of university administrative documents in Italian. Overall, the guidelines presented in this study prove to be valuable both practically and theoretically. They help identify and address non-inclusive expressions while highlighting the complexities of obscuration and visibility in gender-fair language reformulation. In addition, the statistical analysis of the created corpus shows how administrative texts tend to contain gender-unfair language, especially the masculine overextended expressions, showing the need to adopt specific and complete guidelines that lead (and support the staff training) to the use of a more gender-fair language.","Gender-fair language (GFL), also known as inclusive language, refers to the use of linguistic expressions that promote gender equality and avoid reinforcing gender stereotypes. The Italian language, like many others, has traditionally exhibited gender asymmetries and biases, which have perpetuated gender inequality and exclusion. However, in recent years, there has been a growing awareness and effort to address these issues by promoting GFL. In this work, we present the annotation scheme we developed to identify and reformulate gender-unfair expressions, and the corpus we applied it to, encompassing a range of administrative documents of the University of Brescia. The significance of addressing gender-unfair expressions stems from concerns raised by several researchers. In Italian, a personal noun’s grammatical gender typically corresponds to its referent’s gender. In certain cases, however, a discrepancy between the two arises. Crucially, such discrepancies are characterized by an asymmetrical nature, as has been highlighted both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. In Italian, as well as in other languages with gendered nouns, the issue of GFL presents a dual challenge. Firstly, the binary distinction between masculine and feminine in the Italian gender system excludes individuals who identify outside the male-female dichotomy. Consequently, non-binary individuals are consistently misgendered due to the absence of dedicated linguistic forms. Secondly, the usage of the generic masculine (e.g., using masculine profession names to refer to individuals of any gender) and the overextended masculine (referring to mixed-gender groups using the masculine plural) predominantly evoke masculine mental representations, thereby limiting the visibility of female and non-binary individuals. Notably, the presence of a single man in a group is sufficient to alter the gender of the term used to refer to the group, whereas the reverse does not hold true for inverted genders. These discrepancies, in addition to their asymmetrical nature, impact the mental representations we construct. Despite the Italian convention of using masculine terms to refer to individuals of unknown gender and mixed groups, psycholinguistic studies highlight potential issues in this respect. Extensive experimentation conducted over several years using various techniques, and across different languages, suggests that the overextended masculine and generic masculine are interpreted as if they were purely masculine. Recognizing the importance of rectifying such language discrepancies, various guidelines have been published over the years. The annotation scheme we propose draws upon the recommendations presented in the available guidelines, to develop a comprehensive framework for addressing gender-unfair expressions in Italian language usage. To the best of our knowledge, our annotation scheme represents a novel approach. While another project (i.e., E-MIMIC) focuses on inclusive language, it simply distinguishes between inclusive and non-inclusive texts. Our annotation scheme appears to be the first one distinguishing between different types of gender-unfair language, and it comprehensively considers all the gender-fair options when it comes to offering alternative wordings. Moreover, applying this scheme of annotation to various administrative texts, we showed how, despite the existence of various guidelines, they remain impregnated with gender-unfair expressions. In this work, firstly we review previous studies on this topic, both in theoretical linguistics (subsection 2.1) and in NLP (subsection 2.2). We then describe in detail the annotation scheme (section 3) and the creation of the annotated corpus (section 4), also providing a preliminary analysis of the data gathered so far.","In recent years, gender-fair language has gained significant attention, leading to the proposal of new strategies in various languages to avoid using masculine or feminine endings. Motivated by these theories, we conducted a study to examine the usage of different solutions in practical situations. We developed guidelines for gender-fair annotation and reformulation of texts, which we applied to a corpus of 1,024 portions of university administrative documents in Italian. The corpus was annotated by 5 experts, and in 422 cases the annotators identified at least one gender-unfair expression. The preliminary analysis of this corpus highlighted the need to adopt specific guidelines (as well as a list of words to pay particular attention to) to support administrative staff in writing gender-fair texts. Applying our annotation and reformulation guidelines to real data has led to theoretical advancements: we discovered that ‘obscuration’ and ‘visibility’ strategies can coexist within the same reformulation, and we consequently updated the annotation scheme to include ‘mixed’ alternatives. To summarize, the annotation scheme has proven valuable both practically and theoretically. It facilitated the identification of gender-unfair expressions and the formulation of alternatives. Moreover, it revealed the inadequacy of an exclusive distinction between obscuration and visibility, emphasizing the need to incorporate a new type of strategy (i.e., ‘mixed’ alternatives) into the classification. Although the created annotation scheme has been applied only to administrative texts so far, the guidelines are formulated in such a way that they can be easily applied to data pertaining to different domains. Indeed, we plan to extend the annotation to other data, like web pages of a University that describes its organization and its events. Finally, the resulting corpus, composed of 3,195 portions of texts identified as gender-unfair and reformulated with at least one alternative, could be used in the context of training models to recognize gender-unfair expressions and suggest their alternatives.",21,Gender and Inclusive Language Studies

Starting from the multilingual cased DistilBERT and MiniLM models, we modified the embedding layers and then carried out a continued pre-training procedure on Italian Wikipedia data using whole word masking, resulting in two uncased models. Blaze-IT has 55M parameters and weighs 217MB, while Flare-IT has 17M parameters and only weighs 67MB. The models are tailored to analyze large volumes of natively digital text, such as wikis, web pages, and news articles, written in correct and fluent Italian. We evaluate their performances on various downstream tasks and compare them to other models in the same class. We also discuss the limitations of our models and suggest possible directions for future work. Our results show that our models achieve competitive performances while being much smaller than other monolingual models, making them suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.","Natural Language Processing (NLP) has rapidly advanced in recent years, with language models such as BERT [1] (and its variants) and GPT [2] achieving state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks. However, the sheer size and complexity of these models pose a significant challenge when it comes to analyzing large volumes of data or deploying applications in low-resource settings, where CPU parallelization is the only viable way to speed up computation (since GPUs are not available or not cost-effective) and loading multiple models in parallel can quickly flood the RAM. While some previous work focused on creating a small uncased model for the Italian language by exploiting knowledge distillation [3] (which produced an effective Italian DistilBERT model [4], with approximately 40% fewer parameters than a classic BERT model), other research aimed to reduce the size of the embedding layer to focus a multilingual model on a single language [5]. Quantization and pruning techniques are also widely used [6][7]. In this paper, we present two lightweight language models, based on BERT [1] and MiniLM [8] respectively, both designed specifically for the Italian language. The first one (Blaze-IT) is overall 50% lighter than typical monolingual BERT models and 20% lighter than standard DistilBERT models, while still producing high-quality results (see the section Results). The second one (Flare-IT) is 85% lighter than monolingual BERT and 75% lighter than DistilBERT. In addition, both models are uncased, which makes them extremely versatile and suitable for a wide spectrum of scenarios where word capitalization might not be respected or reliable. Our models can effectively process natural language inputs and perform a wide range of NLP tasks such as topic modeling, named entity recognition, and question answering, highlighting the importance of developing lightweight language models that can operate effectively in resource-constrained settings, making NLP accessible to a wider range of use-cases.","In this paper, we presented Blaze-IT, a lightweight language model based on BERT, and Flare-IT, a lightweight language model based on MiniLM, both specifically tailored for the Italian language. Our models are significantly smaller than other monolingual Italian models, the first one weighing 217MB and having 55M parameters, the second one weighing only 67MB and having 17M parameters. We achieved this by starting with the multilingual DistilBERT and MiniLM models, reducing the embedding layer, and further pre-training them on Italian Wikipedia data using whole word masking. While the models are designed to excel on correctly written digital text, they may struggle with noisy, informal language, or domain-specific jargon. The limited size of our models makes them well-suited for local environments and applications where large volumes of data have to be processed, especially if no hardware acceleration is available, since the execution of these light models can be easily parallelized on multiple CPUs. They are also ideal when computational resources or memory are limited, such as on mobile devices or edge-computing environments, or even in cloud-computing scenarios where serverless applications are involved, since these models can be quickly loaded and used in stateless functions. We hope that our work will help lower the entry barrier for natural language processing tasks for researchers and practitioners working in low-resource settings. In future work, we plan to investigate methods for further compressing the size of transformer-based models while maintaining performances, perhaps combining the techniques shown in this work with model quantization. We also aim to expand the capabilities of our models, to handle informal and noisy text, and to develop domain-specific versions of the models for specialized applications. Overall, we believe that this work represents a step towards democratizing access to natural language processing tools and techniques, and we look forward to further developments in this area.

However, access to these models is often restricted to paid API services, limiting researchers’ ability to conduct extensive investigations. Although some open-source models have been developed by the community, these are usually either English-centric or multilingual, lacking specific adaptation for the Italian language. To address this gap and enhance open resources for Italian, we introduce *Camoscio*, a language model fine-tuned to follow user prompts specifically in Italian. We fine-tuned the smallest variant of LLaMA (7B parameters) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a dataset of instruction prompts translated into Italian using ChatGPT. Our results show that *Camoscio*’s zero-shot performance on various Italian downstream tasks is competitive with existing models that have been specifically fine-tuned for similar tasks. All project artifacts, including the code, dataset, and model, are released to the community at the following URL: [URL].","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of natural language processing tasks. However, most of these models are controlled by for-profit organizations that typically limit access to their models through paid APIs. This restriction hampers researchers who require access to model weights and detailed training data for comprehensive studies, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications like the medical field, where data cannot be shared with external providers. To address this, several open-source models have emerged as alternatives to proprietary models. Nevertheless, these are primarily English-centric or multilingual, often providing subpar performance on monolingual tasks and limited support for Italian. For instance, BLOOM, the largest open multilingual model available, lacks any specific Italian data, while LLaMA contains only a minimal amount of Italian-language training data. Moreover, these models typically employ a standard language modeling objective, predicting the next token based on previous tokens, trained on raw text corpora. Yet, research indicates that instruction-tuning, a second phase of training on instructional data, is essential for improving performance on downstream tasks. A recent milestone in this direction was achieved by Taori et al., who introduced Stanford Alpaca, an instruction-tuned version of LLaMA tailored for English. Building on this approach, this paper introduces Camoscio, an Italian instruction-tuned version of LLaMA, trained on a dataset derived from the instruction-tuning dataset of Stanford Alpaca translated into Italian. Specifically, we fine-tuned the smallest version of LLaMA, with 7 billion parameters, using LoRA, an efficient parameter-tuning technique that enables training larger models on standard hardware. Our contributions are as follows: We introduce a dataset for instruction tuning in Italian, derived from a translation of the Stanford Alpaca dataset. We train Camoscio on this dataset and evaluate its zero-shot performance on multiple Italian downstream tasks, including NewsSum-IT, SQuAD-IT, and XFORMAL IT. We release all associated artifacts—code, dataset, and model checkpoints—to support ongoing research and development in Italian NLP.","In this paper, we introduced Camoscio, a 7-billion-parameter instruction-tuned model specifically developed for the Italian language, along with a corresponding Italian instruction-tuning dataset. Our results demonstrate that Camoscio’s zero-shot performance on various Italian-language downstream tasks is competitive with existing models that have been fine-tuned for these tasks. While these models have recognized limitations, Camoscio represents an initial step toward a versatile, generalist model capable of handling a broad array of tasks in Italian without the need for explicit fine-tuning. This capability is particularly valuable in domains where data is limited or unavailable, such as the medical field. To further support the development of open resources for Italian, we are making all associated artifacts—code, dataset, and model—publicly available to the community.",1,Language Models

Enhancing e-procurement solutions can significantly aid in managing and investing these funds effectively. In e-procurement, each tender is assigned a code through the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) to classify its subject matter. Our research addresses the challenge of automating CPV code assignment for tenders, approaching it both as a classification problem and a generative task. For model development and evaluation, we constructed a dataset of 5 million Italian tenders sourced from the National Anti-Corruption Authority (Autorità nazionale anticorruzione - ANAC) website. Results indicate that text classification methods currently offer the best performance for this task. However, the findings also demonstrate the potential of generative models to address limitations in existing classification techniques, offering promising avenues for refining CPV code assignment and, in turn, optimizing procurement processes and enhancing efficiency in public sector operations.","The role of tenders as means of investment of public funds and as vehicles of strategic development is nowadays crucial. For this reason, developing and enabling new solutions for e-procurement procedures can help to manage and invest funds. In e-procurement, the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) allows assigning a code that classifies its subject to each tender. This study addresses the challenge of automatically assigning a CPV code to a tender. We tackle this problem in two different ways: as a classification problem and as a generative task. To develop and test our models, we build a dataset of 5M Italian tenders extracting them from the National Anti-Corruption Authority (Autorità nazionale anticorruzione - ANAC) website. Results show that text classifier approaches exhibit superior performance in this regard. However, they also reveal the potential of generative models in overcoming the limitations of existing classification methods for CPV code assignment in tender classification, providing valuable insights for improving procurement processes and enhancing efficiency in public sector operations. Knowledge organization systems (KOS), such as thesauri, gazetteers, lexical databases, ontologies, and classification systems, are used by institutions to organize large data collections, e.g. documents, web pages, and texts. Using a standard format guarantees semantic interoperability and allows for a faster exchange of information. Public procurement represents a field where adopting such systems can bring many advantages. On one hand, citizens can access data more easily, enabling more straightforward communication with institutions, which can help streamline many bureaucratic processes. Concurrently, adopting KOS systems in procurement has profound implications for professionals working within public administrations. In fact, these systems can serve as invaluable tools, offering support in the day-to-day activities of public sector employees. Integrating advanced technologies will facilitate a paradigm shift towards higher productivity and efficiency. Tasks that were once labor-intensive and time-consuming can now be executed with greater precision and speed, allowing public administrators to focus on more strategic and value-driven aspects of their roles. For this reason, in the field of public procurement, the European Union developed a Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) that identifies the subject of a tender. The adoption of the CPV also allows companies to find new public contracts easily, thus fostering competitiveness. The CPV is structured as a tree of codes comprising 9 digits, eight plus a check digit, and specifies whether the tender in question refers to supplies, works or services covered by the contract. Each digit indicates progressively finer-grained classifications. More specifically, each CPV is composed as follows: - the first two digits identify the divisions (e.g. 71000000-8 Servizi architettonici, di costruzione, ingegneria e ispezione (Architectural, construction, engineering and inspection services)); - the first three digits identify the groups (e.g. 71300000-1 Servizi di ingegneria (Engineering services)); - the first four digits identify the classes (e.g. 71310000-4 Servizi di consulenza ingegneristica e di costruzione (Consultative engineering and construction services)); - the first five digits identify the categories (e.g. 71311000-1 Servizi di consulenza in ingegneria civile (Civil engineering consultancy services)); - each of the last three digits provides an additional degree of precision within each category (e.g. 71311210-6 Servizi di consulenza stradale (Highways consultancy services)); - a ninth digit serves to verify the previous digits. Examples of CPV codes are: 30200000-1 (Computer equipment and supplies), 30230000-0 (Computer hardware), and S30231000-7 (Computers and printers). The supplementary vocabulary can be used to complete the description of the subject of a contract. The items consist of an alphanumeric code corresponding to a denomination that allows you to provide further details on the specific nature or destination of the asset to be purchased. The alphanumeric code is structured as follows: - a first level, consisting of a letter corresponding to a section (e.g. A Materiali (Materials)); - a second level, consisting of a letter corresponding to a group (e.g. AA Metalli e leghe (Metal and alloy)); - a third level, consisting of two digits corresponding to the attribute (AA02-4 Alluminio (Aluminium)); - the last digit is used to verify the previous ones. Examples of supplementary codes are the following: AA01-1 Metal, or UB05-6 Office items. The main vocabulary comprises 9,454 terms and, more specifically, 45 divisions, 272 groups, 1,002 classes, 2,379 categories, and 5,756 sub-categories. Assigning a CPV to a tender is a task which is accomplished by RUPs (Responsabile Unico del Procedimento, i.e. Tender’s Managers), however, given the high number of terms, it is really difficult even for human experts to identify the right CPV to use. For this reason, despite assuring a fine-grained classification, the high number of labels frequently leads to errors in the CPV assignment like typos or wrong interpretation of the description of each code. Another phenomenon is represented by the skewed usage of the codes as there is a small number of CPVs which are more known and thus used more frequently while a large number of CPVs are underused. Given these premises, in this work, we propose a method for automatically classifying tenders to their CPV codes. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the approaches available at the state of the art, Section 3 contains the details of the proposed solution, Section 4 reports the results obtained by the evaluation of our model, and finally Section 5 closes the paper.","In this paper, we tackle the challenge of categorizing a tender by aligning it with the comprehensive Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV), i.e. a meticulously curated European lexicon of codes designed to precisely identify the subject matter of a tender. The complexity of this task lies in the diverse nature of procurement scenarios, where each tender has its own description and requirements. The CPV emerges as a fundamental tool in deciphering the procurement language, trying to define a European dictionary allowing interoperability among different countries. Our proposed methodologies encompass two distinctive approaches: the former relies on a conventional text classification paradigm, whereas the latter leverages a generative strategy hinging on the encoder-decoder architecture as conceptualized by the T5 model. In our systematic exploration of the system’s proficiency in discerning the accurate division of a tender, specifically on the initial two digits of the CPV, it becomes evident that text classifier approaches provide the best results. Nevertheless, a noteworthy result surfaces when we focus on the holistic identification of the entire CPV through a descriptive context. In this context, the generative approaches exhibit commendable efficacy, demonstrating promising outcomes. Notably, these generative techniques surpass established baselines constructed through conventional keyword-centric search engines, attesting to their heightened capabilities in nuanced comprehension and contextual inference.",20,In-domain IR and IE

Focusing on the phenomenon of misogyny, we carried out a corpus-based data analysis around victims of online hate campaigns. Targets were selected to study how misogyny and sexism intersect with other categories of social hatred and discrimination such as xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia. This study includes an event-driven analysis of hate on Twitter concerning specific targets, the process of developing the Inters8 corpus, and its manual annotation according to a novel multi-level scheme designed to assess the presence of intersectional hatred.","The term intersectionality refers to the coexistence of multiple forms of social categorizations such as ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, social class, disability, etc., which can lead to discrimination and generate obstacles in the daily lives of those affected [1]. In the specific case of misogyny, discrimination takes different shapes depending on the other co-existing forms of discrimination such as racism, classism, ableism, or homophobia [1]. Therefore, the phenomenon should not be studied in isolation. The coexistence of different forms of discrimination suggests the study of social interactions and the intersectionality between multiple categories of hate. It is interesting to explore how language may vary when interactions involve people who are at the intersection of multiple discriminated social categories that are henceforth referred to as dimensionalities. In particular, [1] explained how intersectionality between multiple dimensionalities may generate a new discriminated category framed and treated differently. The objective of this paper is to analyze how misogynistic hatred intersects with other dimensionalities and how this appears in a micro-blogging social platform such as Twitter. The first contribution of this paper is an analysis of gender discrimination, inequality comparisons, presence of stereotypes, also oriented to shed light on how users interact with, support, and attack targets of misogynous hatred on social media. As a second contribution, we created Inters8, an Italian corpus containing a subset of TWITA [2] filtered by following a target and event selection process, for the purpose of studying intersectionality. Thereafter, a portion of the corpus related to Silvia Romano’s liberation [3] was annotated (called Inters8_SRomano) so as to explore characteristics of intersectional hatred in a specific pilot study. Outline. After a brief technical contextualization (Section 2), we describe the target-event driven analysis, the creation of the Inters8 corpus and the annotation task (Section 3). Then, the novel annotation scheme applied to the data is described (Section 4) and a discussion of the outcome of the annotation process is presented (Section 5). Conclusions and future work end the paper.","Developing the Inters8 corpus, built considering an intersectional target-event pair, allowed us to explore a case study and analyze Twitter interactions related to Silvia Romano on social media. The manual annotation applied highlights how multiple dimensionalities coexist and intertwine in cases of intersectional hate. Despite the evidence of the phenomenon and its dynamics, results presented here are related to the specific case study taken into account, and to the target and the event selected. In fact, at the current stage of development, the Inters8 corpus includes content related to the specific intersectional Silvia Romano’s liberation target-event pair. We plan to expand the corpus with additional targets, events, and social categories. It would then be interesting to compare multiple targets in the same intersection and study how local culture might influence the phenomenon over several countries. As the corpus is built around the Italian context, the data are exclusively in Italian. The integration of multiple languages would allow for greater generalization and the study of the geographic distribution of the phenomenon around known people and events. Finally, there are many interactions on social networks, and the experimental study for automatic detection of intersectional hate may be a challenge of particular interest.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

In this context, our study aimed to use a language model to examine number variation in selected Russian somatic idioms that include both locally and generally marked nouns. Overall, the model’s sensitivity confirmed the significance of number in idioms, particularly in cases where the semantics of number is especially relevant.","Somatic idioms are phraseological units containing lexemes that refer to human or animal body parts [1, 2]. This class of idioms appears in many languages, due to the universal nature of somatic lexicons. Somatisms are often studied from a semantic perspective, particularly through contrastive analyses, as their meanings are considered culturally specific conceptualizations. However, to our knowledge, theoretical and computational linguistic research has not yet explored the morpho-semantic features of grammatical number [3] within idiomatic meanings. Moreover, our focus on number is driven by the observation that pluralization often affects the lexical properties of somatic terms. Specifically, nouns representing bipartite or complex body parts, which naturally imply plurality, tend to occur more frequently in the plural form across languages. This phenomenon, known as local or semantic markedness [4, 5], occurs when the singular form becomes the locally marked member of the pair, altering the morpho-semantic interaction between singular and plural forms. Our study aims to investigate how grammatical number changes impact the structure of somatic idioms. In particular, we posed two questions: Does variation in grammatical number significantly impact the idiomatic structure of Russian somatic idioms? Does the type of markedness influence the likelihood of singular or plural usage? We hypothesized that changes in number would affect the structure of somatic idioms, especially in cases of local markedness. Specifically, we predicted that switching the number in locally marked somatic terms would have a more pronounced effect on idioms than it would for generally marked terms. The following sections outline our approach to these questions, beginning with a review of related work. We describe the creation of a new dataset of Russian somatic idioms to test our hypotheses1. Next, we detail our experiment conducted with ruBERT, a Russian-trained BERT model, employing methodologies similar to Salazar et al. [6] for acceptability and Pedinotti et al. [7] for semantic plausibility. The results and their implications are discussed in the final sections. We conclude by addressing our research questions and highlighting the significance of our findings and potential directions for future research.","Based on the experiment presented, we can conclude that our initial assumptions are partially justified. By comparing the original sentences to the manipulated and control sentences, we found that, overall, number significantly affects the probability of the constituents within the idiom. Specifically, the variation of idioms appears to be influenced by the morpho-semantic properties of the nominal constituent in the idioms considered. Our data showed that the result varies depending on the type of markedness. For generally marked constituents, a change in number is more probable. This may confirm the general tendency of number as a flexible dimension in idioms, which does not alter the idiomatic structure. On the other hand, locally marked terms show a significant difference in probability between singular and plural forms. This difference suggests that number variation is less probable in these cases, which may indicate a less flexible idiomatic structure. However, some terms exhibit a peculiar condition whose interpretation may require future hypotheses. Despite the correlation between human judgment and the PLL measure shown in Pedinotti et al. [7], the inclusion of human evaluations could still be necessary due to the figurative meaning of idioms. This comparison could improve the robustness of the analysis while clarifying the results obtained by the model. Additionally, given the unexpected outcomes for some nouns, a larger dataset that includes more idioms per noun and a wider variety of nouns could be designed to enhance the study.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The entire aligned corpus has been used as a gold standard to evaluate Bertalign, an embedding-based automatic sentence aligner. Results obtained with a custom parameter setting are compared to those achieved using default settings and a length-based algorithm (Gale-Church), showing very good performance with an F1 score slightly below 0.9.

We show that emotion triggering is a crucial persuasion technique widely employed by unscrupulous content generators. Based on a dataset of real-life fakes analyzed by fact-checking professionals, we identify the most common types of triggered emotions, which are then used as a taxonomy for further annotation.","The manipulative content, ranging from propaganda to hate campaigns, fake news, trolling, and similar, is becoming more widespread, threatening our access to truthful and unbiased information and undermining our rights to make informed decisions as individuals and as members of society. While there is a growing body of multidisciplinary research on identifying untruthful content, there is still very limited understanding of the manipulative techniques employed by unscrupulous content writers to convince the reader and ultimately change their point of view. We believe that this manipulation occurs through multiple channels: careful selection of fact-checkable and non-fact-checkable claims, biased yet seemingly solid argumentation/analytics, multimedia support, and, most importantly, the emotional component. Our current study focuses on emotion triggering – a technique widely used by content writers. When the reader experiences a strong feeling, they become less critical, easily overlooking deficiencies in the argumentation, making them more prone to manipulation. Fig. 1 shows examples of manipulative textual content with strong emotional triggering. In (1a), the message appeals strongly to fear by mentioning HIV, intensified further by mentioning ""children."" The fact-checking report informs the reader that the COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any HIV material, but do contain other lipids to protect the mRNA. However, distressed users might not trust this information fully, due to the strong emotion of fear for their children’s health. Example (1b) shows a typical manipulative message not addressed properly by the state-of-the-art verification-oriented technology. The message combines a verifiable true claim (""Murkowski, Collins, and Romney voted for Ketanji Brown Jackson"") with a statement that seems like a similarly factual claim (""Murkowski, Collins, and Romney are pro-pro-pedophile""), but is actually an explanation/opinion offered by the writer. This triggers anger toward the authorities under scrutiny, their presumed hypocrisy, and their presumed (lack of) values. Again, the triggering is intensified by bringing up a topic related to children. The fact-checking report debunks this claim, stating that ""Sens. Murkowski, Collins, and Romney have clear track records of acting against child exploitation, whether online or in person,"" and that the implied accusations about Judge Johnson are ""misleading."" Nevertheless, an emotionally driven reader might still remain manipulated (""no smoke without fire""), even if only partially. These examples show that fake news is much more complex than simply untrue messages. They may combine true facts with partially false or impossible-to-check statements, provide biased analytics on top, and add very strong emotional messages to manipulate readers. We believe that while the NLP community is making impressive progress on the fact verification task, our understanding of other phenomena related to manipulative content is still rather limited. The goal of our study is to gain a deeper and more realistic insight into the emotional component of fakes. As a first step, we provide a qualitative, data-driven analysis of emotion triggering. The contributions of this study are as follows: (i) we provide data-driven analysis, focusing on real data, combining original (source) fakes and high-quality reports by professional fact-checkers to improve our insight; (ii) we aim at a taxonomy of triggered emotions covering a majority of real-life fakes, departing from more theory-oriented labels; and (iii) we analyze perceived (i.e., triggered) emotions, as opposed to the common focus on expressed emotions, because we believe that induced sentiment plays a more important role in manipulation/persuasion.","This study focuses on the emotional component of manipulative online content. By analyzing real-life fake content from PolitiFact, we have observed a variety of emotional triggers used to promote unscrupulous content, agitating users and making them less critical of deficiencies in the fact selection and argumentation of the manipulative discourse. We have found that emotions play a crucial role in advancing different kinds of manipulative agendas. It is therefore extremely important for the scientific community to extend state-of-the-art verification-based approaches to fact-checking and incorporate models for emotion triggering and fallacious argumentation. Our study identifies the most common types of emotions triggered by manipulative content. However, defining these emotions accurately is not a trivial task, as we have already observed with fear. Our current work focuses on refining the definitions of the most common triggers to provide reliable annotation guidelines and create a dataset of emotional appeals. Triggered emotions (reactions) have so far mostly been out of the scope of the NLP community, where the vast majority of research focuses on emotions expressed in the document. We believe that our research can contribute to a better understanding of perceived emotions, which are crucial for modeling a text’s impact on the reader. In particular, we plan to study the relation between expressed and triggered emotions and investigate possibilities of transferring high-performing state-of-the-art (expressed) emotion recognition models to account for triggered emotions. Finally, we believe that a multi-factor understanding of manipulative content is essential to generate an adequate response and thwart misinformation. Emotionally-loaded fakes are particularly hard to debunk since they make the user less receptive to the rational argumentation of fact-checkers. As part of our future work, we want to investigate strategies for automatic response generation that take into account the emotional component and try to produce an adequate reaction, regaining the users’ trust.",15,Fact Checking and Fake News Detection

This makes it hard to reliably apply such tools in the real world to support fact-checkers’ work. In this paper, we propose a categorization of claim ambiguity and label the largest Italian test set based on it. Moreover, we create challenge sets across two axes of variation: genres and fact-checking sources. Our experiments using transformer-based semantic search show a large drop in performance under domain shift, and indicate the benefit of models’ abstention in case of lacking evidence.","Countering the spread of mis/disinformation is one of the major challenges of our society, but human fact-checkers struggle to cope with the increasing amount of content being published. On these bases, in recent years automated fact-checking has gained increasing attention in the NLP community, resulting in a significant body of works and initiatives, e.g., the Fact Extraction and VERification Workshop (FEVER), at its 7th edition in 2023 [1]. Research efforts in NLP for automated fact-checking span over a plurality of tasks, from claim detection to verdict prediction and justification production [2]. Nevertheless, languages other than English, one of them being Italian, are mostly overlooked in current NLP research on the topic. Specifically, little work has been done to build annotated corpora for the Italian language, which is currently included in just a handful of multilingual datasets, i.e., X-Fact [3] and FakeCovid [4]. To exacerbate the problem, most datasets for automated fact-checking not only include underspecified claims for which verdicts are hard-to-impossible to be determined [5], but also typically lack domain diversity, making it difficult to ascertain the reliability of the resulting fact-checking systems when applied on texts reflecting different genres (e.g., from news headlines to posts on social media). In this paper, we aim to advance automated fact-checking in Italian by examining claim ambiguity in the largest, publicly-available test set to date, and providing means to measure and mitigate the impact of domain shift along genres and sources dimensions of variation. Our study shows that automated fact-checking in Italian is still far from being reliably applied in the real-world, and indicates the benefit of models’ abstention in case of lacking evidence for verification. Contributions i) We propose a categorization of claim ambiguity, ii) annotate the Italian test portions of X-Fact according to it, and iii) create challenge test sets for studying automated fact-checking in Italian under domain shift. We further iv) assess performance shift using transformer-based semantic search, v) highlighting the benefit of abstention in the case of insufficient evidence.","In this work, we show that domains do have a large impact on performance of automated fact-checking for Italian, and the faculty of abstention may be considered to cope with lack of sufficient evidence. Moreover, we contribute to the community by classifying claim ambiguity in the largest Italian test set to date and distributing Italian challenge test sets reflecting diversified domains. Future work includes complementing challenge sets with further versions by multiple annotators as well as automating claim ambiguity assessment. Moreover, the confidence level of the classifier could be investigated and measured with tailored metrics to improve automated fact-checking reliability in handling uncertain cases. In general, as suggested by Schlichtkrull et al. (2023) [16], it would be important to assess the system efficacy with its intended users, in order to evaluate any unforeseen harm possibly caused by actual applications of the technology. In the future, we therefore plan to test our system by including it in the workflow adopted by professional fact-checkers to verify possible cases of mis/disinformation.",15,Fact Checking and Fake News Detection
555_2023,2023,,"Vincenzo Norman Vitale, Loredana Schettino, Francesco Cutugno",On incrementing interpretability of machine learning models from the foundations: a study on syllabic speech units,ENG,3,1,0,Università di Napoli Federico II,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Naples,"Modern ASR systems generally encode information by employing representations that favour performance indicators such as Word Error Rate (WER), making the interpretation of results and the diagnosis of any error extremely difficult if not impossible. In particular, within the context of end-to-end ASR systems, studies have been devoted to investigating the degrees of explainability of such systems by considering the use of different sets of linguistic features. This work explores the potential of different machine learning algorithms by considering features extracted from syllabic units of analysis and highlights that relying on syllabic Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients increases the interpretability of complex techniques. In fact, the latter currently extract basic units in ways that are highly skewed toward operational convenience. The proposed method would reduce the need for computational resources both in training and in the inference phases, which results in economical and less time-consuming processes.","The advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) enabled modern ASR systems and, more in general, Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to perform at their best when fed with enough training data and supplied with sufficient computational resources. The recent tendency is to focus efforts on incrementing performance indicators like Word Error Rate (WER), making DNN models behind the scenes increasingly complex and larger, with the effect of a dramatic reduction in their interpretability and an increase in the number of parameters considered and therefore in the required computation effort [1, 2]. As an example, state-of-the-art End-to-End (E2E) ASR systems [3, 4, 5, 6] employ self-supervised learning techniques to determine, based on huge amounts of unlabelled data, the best representation of the speech signal based on fixed-length units, which results in adaptable systems. In the same way, Big Language Models (Big LM) employ advanced encoding techniques, like those based on Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)[7, 8, 9], to encode sub-word units reducing their impact on memory and thus allowing for the creation of bigger models with millions or even billions of parameters aimed at catching a wider range of natural language nuances. On the one hand, these techniques definitely improve systems’ performances and capabilities. On the other hand, they also reduce models’ interpretability from their foundations, which not only makes them increasingly similar to black boxes but also augments their need for computational resources. Wav2Vec2 authors [3] suggest that 'switching to a seq2seq architecture and a word piece vocabulary' would result in performance gains. In line with this, the employment of larger and linguistically motivated units, like syllables, could bring several advantages. Firstly, it would improve performance in terms of WER and computational resources required to train and operate these systems. Secondly, it would increment the system’s interpretability, allowing domain experts (i.e. linguists, especially phoneticians) to dive deep into error analysis, which means favoring interpretable rather than computationally efficient but poorly understandable inputs. The main contributions of this study are: • the proposal of an interpretable approach to speech-oriented feature extraction based on syllable; • a comparison of various classification techniques with different interpretability grades.","In this study, we evaluated the use of phonetic syllables as basic units for speech-related tasks aimed at preserving and, if possible, incrementing the interpretability of different learning techniques. We employed four different feature sets extracted upon the assumption of the phonetic syllable as a fundamental unit, considering different points of view: the more theoretically informed MFCC-based that is strongly tied to the signal; the more analytic OPSM based on Opensmile statistical analysis; the most extended which is a combination of both; the most computationally efficient based on the PCA analysis. Then, upon these feature sets, we evaluated the performance of three well-known machine learning techniques known for being highly interpretable. Finally, we compared the best-performing model, namely the SVM, with a convolutional network on the MFCC set, obtaining comparable performances. Our preliminary results highlight that a set of features aimed at keeping things interpretable, namely the MFCC, lets different methods achieve performances that are comparable to those of richer (Full), analytic (OPSM) or computationally optimized (PCA) sets, which do not retain the same interpretability grade. These findings corroborate the idea that training speech-oriented learning models on larger and linguistically meaningful units could increase the capacity of domain experts and software/ml engineers to diagnose system failures and, at the same time, help reduce the effort and computational resources needed for signal preprocessing. Ongoing analyses involve the enlargement of the annotated datasets to improve the results of further classification trials. In Appendix we reported some preliminary results of a classification trial on an extended dataset, about 26 minutes of hand-annotated speech, consisting of 3589 phonetic syllables. In future works, we plan to extend this kind of study to recent architectures like Squeezeformer[43] or CNN-BLSTM[44].",13,Multimodal
556_2023,2023,,"Romane Werner, Sonja Bitzer, Thomas Francois",Drug name recognition in the cryptomarket forum of Silk Road 2,ENG,3,1,0,Université catholique de Louvain,2,1,1,1,"Romane Werner, Sonja Bitzer, Thomas Francois",0,0,Belgium,"Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve","Drug forums and online chat rooms constitute a relevant source of information for drug use, whose content can serve as reliable sources of information for national agencies with a high number of discussions taking place on various topics. We aimed at investigating whether forum posts could provide useful information as regards to both the early appearance and the monitoring of drug names. A Drug Name Recognition system was used to extract drug terms from the cryptomarket forum of Silk Road 2 thanks to a Conditional Random Fields model. Results of our analysis showed that our model enabled us to discover the presence of 232 new drug names compared to the presence of 106 traditional drug names, which reflect the importance of internet traces as being robust and exploitable with respect to crime phenomena.","Over the past decades, the darknet has gradually emerged as a key platform that enables its users to have access to both illicit goods and services. Within darknet, cryptomarkets have triggered “a significant change in the online drug trade” [1, p. 70]. The Internet, and with it the darknet, facilitates illicit drug trade, as was first highlighted by the success of Silk Road [2], which was taken down by the FBI in 2013. Since then, many new cryptomarkets developed to becoming the largest criminal market in the European Union, which continues to expand [3]. According to the 2017 Europol report, “around 35% of the Organized Crime Groups [are] active in the EU on an international level involved in the production, trafficking or distribution of illegal drugs” [3, p. 4]. Due to their wide use and continuous expansion, online marketplaces are a valuable source of information to gather knowledge about linked criminal activities [4]. In this intelligence perspective, it allows to monitor activity on anonymous marketplaces and provide further knowledge on criminal phenomena. Through digital analysis of data from one of the most popular cryptomarkets, Evolution, researchers confirmed previous results on the predominant position of cannabis-related products (i.e. around 25%) [3, p. 6-8], followed by ecstasy and other stimulants [5]. Another source of relevant and useful information on this criminal phenomenon are anonymized user forums and online chat rooms [6], some of which are also incorporated within certain cryptomarkets. In these forums, anonymity seems to play a crucial role in users revealing information, be it regarding darknet or surface web forums, as it “allows them to avoid the legal and social risks of identifying themselves as drug users” [7, p. 159], leading the authors to more easily disclose valuable information. Content found on online forums can serve as reliable sources of information with a high number of discussions taking place on various themes [1]. Indeed, members of drug online forums usually seek drug-related information, while also sharing their own drug experiences with other users [7], encouraging and facilitating information sharing about drug purchases and effects [8]. Besides, “specialized forums offer a fertile stage for questionable organizations to promote NPS (New Psychoactive Substances) as a replacement of well-known drugs, whose effects have been known for years and whose trading is strictly forbidden” [8, p. 2]. NPS are defined as “substances of abuse, either in a pure form or a preparation, that are not controlled by the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs or the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, but which may pose a public health threat. The term “new” does not necessarily refer to new inventions — several NPS were first synthesized decades ago — but to substances that have recently become available on the market” [9, p. 2]. As they are among the first to be interested in new trends, researchers thus started investigating the massive use of online forums. These online forums therefore possibly represent a novel approach of harm reduction for drug users and, among others, an “entry point for drug support services” [7, p. 1]. A major challenge in forum analysis can however be pinpointed, as “unlike regular blogs, they include posts from numerous authors with vastly varying levels of activity, writing styles and skills, as well as proficiency in the area to which the forum is devoted” [10, p. 787]. In that context, the use of NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques has to be pinpointed, as they can help provide insights into the appearance of new drugs on the market. Indeed, several studies concentrated on the automatic extraction of drug terms from online drug forums (see for example [11] or [12]), while other studies noted that CRF (Conditional Random Fields) showed good performance results as regards the recognition of drug terms [13], thanks to the use of specific linguistic features (e.g., POS (Part-of-Speech) tagging). Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no study explored the use of a CRF model for DNR (Drug Name Recognition) in a cryptomarket forum. The aim of the current study is thus to determine whether methods from the field of NLP and of computational forensic linguistics can be applied for drug-term discovery, and more particularly, whether CRF can be used as a model for a DNR system to uncover novel drug terms from the cryptomarket forum of Silk Road 2. The first objective is to classify terms that are considered as completely new in regards to a database of well-known drugs, those that are variants of already-known drugs and those that are variants of new drug terms. A second objective is to help identify new drug terms and thus strengthen the monitoring of existing NPS early-warning systems. It also aims at understanding how the contribution of data that was extracted from a particular discussion forum, namely Silk Road 2, can be used to monitor the appearance of NPS.","In order to assist states in both their identification as well as their reporting of NPS, the UNODC decided to establish the so-called Early Warning Advisory (EWA). The latter serves as a repository full of information on known NPS in order to improve the international understanding of NPS distribution and effects and thus to better understand particular health threats posed by the NPS. The latter specifically extracted both data and information that were found on the Internet. This is the reason why we decided to extract data from forum posts from the cryptomarket of Silk Road 2, as they contain user-generated content that is different from simple product lists that can be normally found on cryptomarkets. We thus aimed at analyzing whether forum posts could provide useful information as regards the early appearance of drug names. The purpose of this research was also to develop a CRF-DNR model in order to analyze whether both the use of NLP techniques, such as the CRF model, and of specific linguistic features could help extract (new) drug terms. For the purpose of this study, we decided to semi-automatically annotate our corpus, which enabled us to have access to an annotated corpus and thus to train our CRF model. It is important to emphasize that this task would be particularly time-consuming should it be done completely manually, as new posts on (cryptomarket) forums continuously appear; the latter resulting in the never-ending task of manually annotating data and thus new drug terms. Another advantage linked to our method is the fact that the model makes use of data from an already established list rather than by just looking at many random new drug terms. Our analysis enabled us to grasp the number of occurrences of specific drug categories as well as of drugs that are enclosed in the UNODC conventions. It was observed that some drug categories have a higher number of occurrences as regards their traditional drug names (i.e., opium and opiates and Central Nervous System depressants). On the contrary, other drug categories (i.e., cannabis, synthetic cannabinoid, opioids, coca and cocaine, amphetamines and hallucinogens) show a higher number of occurrences as regards their street names. Generally speaking, it could be observed that street names make up for the vast majority of drug term occurrences. Our model also enabled us to discover the presence of 232 new drug names (i.e., names of new drugs, that is to say drugs that do not appear in the UNODC conventions, variant names of traditional drugs but also acronyms of traditional and non-traditional drugs). Hence, 76 new drug names (32.8% of the total of new drugs), 129 variant names of traditional drugs (55.6% of the total of new drugs) and 27 new acronyms of drugs (11.6% of the total of new drugs) were found, against the presence (more or less frequent) of 106 traditional drug names as well as their street names. Moreover, 2279 occurrences of traditional names and their street names were uncovered, while 788 occurrences of new drug names were also detected. It is hence important to notice that although they are considered as “new drug names,” they make up for a certain proportion of the total number of drug names. Moreover, there are also more types in the category of new drug names than in the category of traditional drugs (258 vs. 101, that is to say 69.9% and 31.1%, respectively). With respect to the other two DNR studies (i.e., [12] and [19]) that focused on forum posts, it can be observed that the vast majority of the terms found in this research were not uncovered in these previous studies. It is thus important to emphasize the fact that emerging drug terms can be both extracted and monitored thanks to online resources, such as forum posts. It should be noted that it is possible to rely on the various information that is available on these forums when wishing to grasp new drug terms. Online forums are thus promising sources for the early detection of drugs, suggesting thus that the use of an automated system could help national agencies to identify new drugs. Our approach, however, has limitations that can be worked on. It is important to notice that we only made use of data from one cryptomarket forum, namely Silk Road 2. Even if it is considered as a major cryptomarket, it is not representative of all cryptomarket forums. This analysis could thus be improved by using data gathered from other cryptomarket online forums. It could also be interesting to analyze other online sources, such as websites, cryptomarket shops as well as data found in other languages but also to analyze other online sources, such as websites, cryptomarket shops. Another limitation is linked to the fact that this study made use of posts that were launched on a specific date (i.e., 2014-04-19) and that usually went on for several weeks, thereby giving us a relatively static snapshot of the language used on this specific forum at that particular time. We could thus equally focus on data extracted from other periods of time. An area of future research would be to perform a study by conducting DNR over time, that is to say over various months and years. This kind of study could help gain insight on the rise and fall of specific drug terms. Moreover, an obvious shortcoming that is linked to our model is the fact that it performs poorly at identifying terms that are common in the language but which also have a very specific use in drug-related settings (e.g., shit). Hence, 11.34% of the semi-automatic annotation were considered as false positives, which means that 11.34% of the terms that were annotated as drug terms were not drug terms but referred to other meanings. This represents an important shortfall, as drug terms are often represented as already known and common words. One possible step to tackle this issue would be to add a further grammatical and semantic layer into the model in order to disambiguate homographs (e.g., Word to Gaussian Mixture (w2gm)). It is thus important to emphasize that our model could be improved by using both active learning and iterative corrector, as it can help optimize the annotation using fewer training data and by prioritizing which data should be labeled for the training dataset, so as to yield better annotated data. Another improvement could be to add a Bi-LSTM layer to our CRF model so as to take both context and longer relationships into account.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Creating high-quality educational crosswords can be challenging, but recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning have made it possible to use language models to generate nice wordplays. The exploitation of cutting-edge language models like GPT3-DaVinci, GPT3-Curie, GPT3-Babbage, GPT3-Ada, and BERT-uncased has led to the development of a comprehensive system for generating and verifying crossword clues. A large dataset of clue-answer pairs was compiled to fine-tune the models in a supervised manner to generate original and challenging clues from a given keyword. On the other hand, for generating crossword clues from a given text, Zero/Few-shot learning techniques were used to extract clues from the input text, adding variety and creativity to the puzzles. We employed the fine-tuned model to generate data and labeled the acceptability of clue-answer parts with human supervision. To ensure quality, we developed a classifier by fine-tuning existing language models on the labeled dataset. Conversely, to assess the quality of clues generated from the given text using zero/few-shot learning, we employed a zero-shot learning approach to check the quality of generated clues. The results of the evaluation have been very promising, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in creating high-standard educational crosswords that offer students engaging and rewarding learning experiences.","In this paper, we present various contributions, including the introduction of a substantial dataset for Italian clue-answer pairs, we developed an innovative system using Large Language Models to generate educational crossword puzzles from given texts or answers. Our approach combines human supervision and specific guidelines to ensure high-quality and relevant clues. Our system includes a keyword extraction component (79.73% high-quality keywords) and a crossword clue generation component (76.6% relevant and acceptable clues). A validation component filters out unacceptable pairs, achieving a 69.72% detection rate. We conducted an in-depth investigation of fine-tuned generators and classifiers to enhance the quality of clues. Among the models tested, GPT3-Davinci demonstrated exceptional performance in generating clues based on given keywords, producing a remarkable 60.1% of acceptable clues. Moreover, GPT3-Davinci proved to be the most proficient classifier, accurately distinguishing between good clue-answer pairs and unacceptable ones with an impressive 79.88% accuracy. Our algorithm for generating educational crossword schemes is efficient and produces diverse layouts. This study aims to enhance student skills and promote interactive learning. Educators can integrate our system into their instruction for more effective teaching practices. Future research involves developing advanced models for direct clue-answer pair generation and exploring specialized models for different clue types.

For this reason, automated crossword solvers designed for a language, may not work well on others. In this paper, we extend Webcrow, an automatic crossword solver, to German, making it the first program for crossword solving in the German language. To address the lack of large clue-answer crossword pairs data, Webcrow combines multiple modules, known as experts, which retrieve potential answers from various resources, including the web, knowledge graphs, and linguistic rules. The system is evaluated on a collection of crosswords from variegate sources, where it is able to solve perfectly 67% of them. Additional analysis reveals that while our solver achieved commendable results, puzzles with poorly constrained schemas and original clues still presented significant hurdles. These findings shed light on the complexity of the crossword-solving problem and emphasize the need for future research to address and overcome these particular challenges effectively.","Automated crossword solving is a challenging problem in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. Solving a puzzle requires multiple skills, ranging from encyclopedic knowledge and linguistics to reasoning and constraint satisfaction. In the past, several automated crossword systems have been proposed for English [1, 2, 3]. Despite the successful results achieved by these approaches, they do not investigate crossword resolution in other languages. All those methods heavily rely on large databases of previously answered clues to retrieve and rank answer candidates, that sometimes are even re-ranked [4, 5, 6, 7]. Berkley Crossword Solver [3] make also use of multiple Language Models that have been fine-tuned to segment answers in words and to correct wrong letters. The need for such resources hinders the application of these solutions to other languages. WebCrow [8, 9] instead, is a crossword solver that was applied also to Italian puzzles. The architecture which is composed of multiple modules, called experts, facilitates the portability to new languages. In this work, we extend WebCrow to the German language. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an automatic solver for German crosswords. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the whole WebCrow architecture is described. Then, in Section 3 we present the data gathered for German and its usage by the WebCrow experts. Experiments are outlined in Section 4. Finally, we summarize our conclusions and directions for future works in Section 5.","In this work we presented German Webcrow, the first crossword puzzle solver for the German Language. We collected both a dataset of clue-answer pairs and a set of German crosswords from different sources having various formats and styles. Webcrow achieved near-perfect word accuracy in Swedish-type crosswords, that proved to be generally easy to solve, solving overall 39/58 perfectly. However, our solver performed poorly on FAZ crosswords. Those puzzles were extremely challenging for multiple reasons, such as the poorly constrained schemas, due to the presence of many black cells, and the rich presence of sophisticated, original clues, involving articulated wordplays that formed words not present in the candidate answers lists. Challenging puzzles like the ones in FAZ are a clear example of how complex the problem is, and why studying crosswords in multiple languages and formats is important for automated crossword solving. In the future we plan to address the current limitations. In particular, we plan to investigate the use of generative models, to cope with the novel unseen clues.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant polarization arose from concerns about vaccines, with misinformation and conspiracy beliefs proliferating on social media. While many studies have analyzed these narratives, the focus has largely been on English-language content. This linguistic bias limits comprehensive global insights. Our study introduces a novel multilingual approach that addresses this gap. By integrating Italian examples into a primarily English dataset, we detect vaccine-hesitant language and demonstrate the model’s adaptability to diverse linguistic data. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating varied linguistic datasets for a more holistic understanding of global narratives on vaccine hesitancy.","Automatically understanding peoples’ narratives on controversial social issues is fundamental to efficiently address the real concerns as they occur fostering collaborative, prosocial behaviors. Vaccination adherence is an exemplar case where society witnessed a notable polarization concerning possible adverse reactions [1, 2]. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and despite vaccines being the most efficient and cost-effective intervention, the spread of misinformation [3], the skepticism around the scientific development of COVID-19 vaccines and the dissemination of conspiracy beliefs [4, 5], proliferated on social media platforms. Numerous studies analyzed user-generated text [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], almost exclusively focusing on the English language due to the availability of models and tools. Even if often English is universally spoken, it limits the analysis in specific sociodemographic groups. Lenti et al. [11] in a purely network-based approach showed the existence of a global misinformation network, calling for a multilingual analysis to further understand the drivers of vaccine hesitancy in the various languages. Here, in light of these issues, we propose a novel approach for multilingual language understanding able to deal with language imbalance. More specifically, here we progressively include Italian instances in a predominantly English dataset for the task of vaccine-hesitant language detection and demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize on previously unseen data. Often, researchers and practitioners have access to large English datasets, but data in other languages, such as Italian, are lacking. We show that including small datasets in different languages can improve overall performance when analyzing texts in several languages.","Here we design and evaluate a method that achieves multilingual vaccine hesitancy detection. The experimental design considers training a multilingual classification model on a mixture of English and Italian text excerpts. Progressively varying the combination of languages in the training data, we obtain a better understanding of the classification problem in the two languages. Additionally, we undertook a novel data collection effort on Twitter, manually annotating content based on vaccination stance. This curated dataset is now freely accessible to the scientific community, providing a valuable resource for further research. By adjusting the language composition in our training data, we gained deeper insights into the classification intricacies across both languages. Notably, our findings suggest that the model can effectively generalize to a different language even when its training set contains a minimal proportion (e.g., 10%) of instances from that language. This indicates the model’s robustness and adaptability in handling linguistic variations with limited data. Importantly, this approach is an important tool for researchers and practitioners who often have access to large datasets in English, but limited resources in other widely spoken languages such as Italian or Spanish. The evaluation shows that composing a mixture dataset can be effective in generating a model that classifies instances in two languages. In fact, the experimentation shows that this mixture is flexible, maintaining consistent performances across different ratios of language presence. This consistency suggests that the mixture approach is promising. Given its language-neutral nature, our technique holds promise for broader applications across multiple languages and diverse domains. As a next step, we aim to explore various multilingual models and languages to further ascertain the scalability and adaptability of our approach.",15,Fact Checking and Fake News Detection

In fact, Italian is not included among the languages supported by the model, making its usage challenging in this context. Within this study, using an open science philosophy, we explore different Language Adaptation strategies for the BLOOM model and assess its zero-shot prompting performance across two different downstream classification tasks over EVALITA datasets. It has been observed that language adaptation followed by instruction-based fine-tuning is effective in correctly addressing a task never seen by the model in a new language learned on a few examples of data.","As language diversity becomes increasingly important in the digital age, the capability of a Natural Language Understanding model to handle a wide array of languages gains significance. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as excellent approaches for comprehending, generating, and manipulating human language with unprecedented accuracy and fluency. They can grasp nuances, idioms, and even ambiguous phrases, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis, question answering, and information retrieval tasks. This enhanced understanding contributes to more effective communication between humans and machines, fostering seamless interactions across various applications. LLMs possess remarkable generalization capabilities, allowing them to perform well on tasks they were not explicitly trained for, also in a multilingual fashion. Among the largest and most effective LLMs is BLOOM, a 176B-parameter open-access language model designed and built thanks to the collaboration of hundreds of researchers. BLOOM is a decoder-only Transformer language model trained on a large corpus comprising hundreds of sources in 46 natural and 13 programming languages, culminating in a dataset spanning 59 languages. However, it excludes some of the world’s most widely spoken languages, including Russian, Korean, and Italian, raising the need for a more inclusive linguistic approach. Training an effective LLM focused solely on a particular language is a prohibitive challenge, given the substantial data and resources required. At the same time, tackling downstream tasks in a specific language necessitates a model with a comprehensive understanding of that language. Our hypothesis centers on the Language Adaptation methodology, which addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge from a pre-trained Language Model (LM) to a specific application language. In this context, we aim to adapt BLOOM models to work with a new language, such as Italian, using only a limited sample size of 100,000 examples. We evaluated the adapted models after instruction-based fine-tuning on two classification tasks using Italian data. Our experiments demonstrate that the Language Adaptation process improves the zero-shot ability of the model when executed in the same language as the evaluation data. A key aim of our work is to develop all methodologies using an open-science approach without relying on private data created or processed by non-open-source tools. All data and models used in this work are under an open-source license, reflecting our commitment to transparency and collaboration with the scientific community. This study proves that fostering innovation and building effective LLMs is achievable using only open resources.","In this paper, we explored a language adaptation strategy for the BLOOM model to address the challenge of handling languages not covered during its training. Our approach is distinguished by its reliance on open-source data, software, and models, aligning with a commitment to transparency and accessibility in research. Despite the remarkable capabilities of the BLOOM model in understanding natural language for widely spoken languages, it showed limitations when applied to languages not included in the original training set, such as Italian. To overcome this limitation, we conducted experiments using the MAD-X language adaptation approach, followed by instruction-based fine-tuning on Italian data. The outcomes of our research demonstrate the effectiveness of language adaptation in significantly improving the zero-shot ability of the BLOOM model for Italian. The combination of MAD-X language adaptation with EVALITA fine-tuning achieved the highest performance on both the AMI2020 and HASPEEDE 2 tasks, showcasing the importance of the adaptation process for downstream classification tasks in Italian. In future work, we plan to evaluate our approach on larger BLOOM models and more recent tasks for Italian. The proposed methodology can be adapted for other languages and requires few examples to achieve satisfying results. The adapted models can be easily fine-tuned on various tasks by providing proper instructions. Our future research will extend to testing this approach with other languages and exploring diverse adaptation strategies, contributing to the broader landscape of language model adaptability.",1,Language Models

Recognizing the challenges inherent in interpreting emotions from ancient texts, we developed a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) tailored for this purpose. This DSL facilitates the annotation of basic sentiments—positive, negative, neutral, or mixed—while also enabling the identification and categorization of specific emotions. To ensure relevance and applicability, we mapped the extracted emotions to authoritative domain ontologies, bridging the gap between ancient emotional expressions and contemporary understanding. Our preliminary results, discussed in detail, demonstrate the potential of our approach in providing deeper insights into the emotional landscape of ancient texts. We believe this methodology can serve as a foundation for future studies aiming to decode emotions in historical literature, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research in humanities and computational linguistics.","This study builds upon the investigations of Pavlopoulos [1] regarding the annotation of sentiment and emotions in the first book of Homer’s Iliad, translated into modern Greek. In this second phase, the focus shifts to analyzing the original ancient Greek text, emphasizing the expressiveness of the annotation system in capturing multiple aspects [2] of the observed textual units. As in the prior work, annotators are tasked with indicating both sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, or mixed) and specific emotions (from an open set of possibilities). However, they can annotate at varying levels of granularity—ranging from a single word to several verses—addressing both paradigmatic (words outside context) and syntagmatic (textual units within context) dimensions. Additionally, the annotations consider different perspectives, such as those of characters and the ancient audience, and their emotions toward various participants in the scene.","This study introduced a domain-specific language for annotating the emotive content of the first book of Homer’s Iliad. We mapped the emotions extracted from the annotations and analyzed the results. Future work includes studying the polarity of additional emotions, exploring verses with contradictory polarities, and performing sentiment analysis based on the subject’s role (annotator, character, or narrator). Furthermore, we plan to involve more annotators to measure inter-annotator agreement and investigate verses that elicit consistent or diverse emotional responses among different annotators.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

A study on the Genoese Language,ENG,2,0,0,"CNRS, Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, PRHLT, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia",2,1,1,2,"Davide Buscaldi, Paolo Rosso",0,0,"France, Spain","Paris, Valencia","In this paper, we analyze the performance of the NLLB-200 models from Meta AI on a manually built parallel corpus of Ligurian (specifically, the Genoese variant), consisting of 283 sentences and their respective Italian translations. Our experiments highlight some issues with NLLB-200, especially regarding local knowledge, stemming from certain choices made during the training process.","NLLB (No Languages Left Behind) [1] is a collection of language models created by Meta AI to fill the void in Machine Translation (MT) for some low- and very low-resource languages. NLLB-200 is the latest model and is capable of providing MT for 200 languages, including some that had never been considered before. One of these languages is Ligurian, an endangered language spoken mainly in the Liguria region in Italy, Monaco (where it is called Monegasque), and some small islands in the Mediterranean Sea (Carloforte and Calasetta in Sardinia). The content in Ligurian on the web is very scarce. The main source is Wikipedia, which has only 11,172 articles in Ligurian, many of them being little more than drafts. In comparison, the number of articles in Welsh, which has an estimated equivalent number of native speakers (500,000), is twenty times greater than Ligurian. This difference is easily explained by the fact that Welsh is an official language, supported by the local government, while Ligurian is mostly spoken orally. The scarcity of content in Ligurian is not the only issue that may affect MT tools and methods. In particular, the syntax of Ligurian has not been completely standardized: many variants of the same word exist, even when pronounced in the same way, due to various reasons. Primarily, there are local variants of Ligurian, but also because the language has been passed down mostly orally from one generation to another. For example, in Monegasque, the word ""white"" is written as giancu, while in Genoese (the predominant variant) it is written as gianco. This problem has been well documented in the work of [2], which also cites the lack of regulatory bodies as a source of variations. In their study, they propose a corpus of normalized and unnormalized texts in Ligurian to train a neural model for the normalization of Ligurian texts. The example in Figure 1 illustrates the high variability of Ligurian spelling. Given this premise, it is important to evaluate whether the NLLB-200 model is capable of dealing with these issues. To this end, we conducted an evaluation by composing a test dataset in Genoese that was not used for NLLB training. The copyright-free subset of this dataset is available at the following address: https://github.com/dbuscaldi/zeneize. In the following section, we describe the NLLB-200 model and how the training was carried out. In Section 3, we present the experiments conducted on our dataset and discuss the results. Finally, in Section 4, we draw some conclusions from this analysis and propose ideas for improving the model based on this experimentation.","From our preliminary analysis, carried out on a dataset specific to the Genoese culture, we can affirm that currently NLLB-200 is not good enough to deal with Genoese texts or to translate text into Genoese. In particular, we found that local toponyms are difficult to translate: how good is an MT tool that is not able to correctly translate the name of the largest city where the language is spoken or the name of the language itself? Given the information provided regarding NLLB-200 models, we can identify two main elements explaining this behavior. The first one is the training data: they do not cover local information, but general English Wikipedia articles, so they lack the context in which Genoese is usually spoken. The second one is the tokenization process and the LASER-3 embeddings: given the high spelling variability of the Ligurian language, we suspect that the tokenization process may not be precise and that it may map some tokens into a position in the embedding space that does not correspond to their actual ""meaning,"" possibly due to interference from other Western Romance languages that are very close to Ligurian. However, NLLB-200 is a big step forward in making endangered languages such as Ligurian and its variants available to everyone. From our point of view, we think that NLLB-200 could be improved in various ways, for instance, by fine-tuning the model on more ""local"" datasets, and possibly including knowledge regarding Out-Of-Vocabulary words, which are often named entities, for example with the methods proposed by [9], or integrating dictionaries to handle named entities.",10,Machine Translation

The Debunker-Assistant adapts ideas from Natural Language Processing and Network Science to counter the spread of online misinformation. Its centerpiece is a set of four News Misinformation Indicators based on linguistically engineered features, models, and network analysis metrics (Echo Effect, Alarm Bell, Sensationalism, and Reliability). In this short contribution, we describe the back-end structure on which the indicators are implemented.","Fake news threatens democracies, public health, and news outlets’ credibility. For this reason, tackling misinformation is an open challenge faced by governments, private companies, and the scientific communities [1]. There are many proposed approaches, some based on AI methods, others on fact-checking by human experts, and still others on a combination of the two [2, 3]. However, the fact that fake news detection algorithms are often owned by private social media companies, and additionally the adoption of “black-boxed” algorithms contribute to the lack of transparency in the fake news identification and filtering process. Debunker-Assistant (D-A) is a back-end AI tool which supports the analysis and detection of online misinformation. The D-A tool takes as an input the link of a news article and returns its misinformation profile based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Network Analysis (NA) features. Such an approach is inspired by the survey provided by [4]. D-A works with Italian and is not bounded to a specific topic: it is designed as a general-purpose tool that can extract relevant features for assessing the quality of information. Its main purposes are: displaying the indicators to deal with misinformation; de-biasing the mechanisms to make the internet trustworthy; showing insights about a certain context to aid the search and discovery of information. In this paper, we present the various features of NLP and NA embedded in the D-A tool and how these features have been designed and developed. As represented in Figure 1, D-A allows users to search for news and compare them against a given set of four macro-indicators of misinformation: Echo Effect, Alarm Bell, Sensationalism, and Reliability. These indicators are designed on the basis of specific linguistic and network features, such as the absence of sources, non-authority of references, the presence of specific figures of speech or flames, and other stylistic characteristics. To operationalize our objectives, we focus on three main actions: Inform: D-A can be freely used by citizens who want to check if content they have read includes potential misinformation signals; Support: D-A can also be adopted by journalists who work in the field of debunking, empowering their activity; Teach: Teachers can use D-A for designing information literacy activities in their classrooms.","D-A is a tool developed in support of detecting online misinformation. Its social impact is twofold. First, it contributes to counter misinformation and improve the quality of information. In fact, the tool is aimed at supporting those who deal with this issue every day. Second, it provides a better understanding of how these artificial intelligence technologies work in the context of the news media. Given the complex and ever-changing nature of content creation and information dissemination, there are several directions for improvement. For example, users could be involved in providing anonymous feedback on the news itself and on the characterization of the evaluated articles, improving the overall performance of the tool, especially for those features that are less explored in the literature. In addition, this type of interaction makes the user think about important aspects of online information, thus increasing awareness. Over time, as users search for new URLs, the core data that feed the models will expand to cover larger and more diverse sets of domains, incorporating a richer perspective on news consumption. To help these research directions, we plan to develop a user-friendly interface and evaluate the general user experience. Finally, a future challenge would be to scale the model for other languages starting from English.",15,Fact Checking and Fake News Detection

Unfortunately, none of these formats covers the wide range of linguistic phenomena related to terminology. To address this issue, we propose to encode Automatic Term Extraction corpora in RDF using the OntoLex-Lemon and the NLP Interchange Format ontologies. Furthermore, we developed a small Italian corpus on waste management legislation to provide an example of the proposed formalization.","Automatic Term Extraction - ATE is an NLP task that involves recognizing terms in specialized corpora. As with most NLP tasks, ATE research benefits from annotated corpora that are employed as training data and evaluation benchmarks. Nevertheless, existing term annotation schemata are far from capturing the complex organization that characterizes the terminology of specialized languages [1, 2, 3]. Most ATE studies, with a few exceptions [4, 5, 6], overlook the complex organization of terms in specialized languages assuming that the terms contained in a corpus belong to a single domain. At best, they draw a difference between domain terms (that belong to the investigated domain) and out-of-domain terms (that belong to different domains). Unfortunately, this assumption is too simplistic since every specialized corpus contains terms from different subject fields. Moreover, in the interest of reusability, researchers who use terminology corpora in their work must be able to define the subject fields of interest according to their needs. Furthermore, ATE corpora do not adhere to standard formats used to encode terminological data like TermBase eXchange, an ISO standard [7], and OntoLex-Lemon, a W3C standard. This lack of standardization poses interoperability issues and hinders the evaluation of ATE tools. The adoption of a standard format will provide at least three main benefits: • It will grant the interoperability of termbases. Therefore if a term is already present in an existing termbase, it could be imported. • It will grant the interoperability of corpora, meaning that multiple corpora could be combined to cover different languages and subject fields. • It will ease the effort made to evaluate ATE tools from both sides developers and users. In this paper, we propose a custom form design of multilevel annotation to formalize ATE corpora in RDF format by using the OntoLex-Lemon1 and the NLP Interchange Format - NIF2 ontologies to represent termbases and corpora, respectively. Moreover, we develop a small annotated corpus to provide a proof-of-concept. The corpus and the code employed in its formalization are publicly available on GitHub3 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the main feature of terms. Section 3 gives an overview of the main ATE corpora. Section 4 illustrates the proposed formalization schema. In Section 5 we describe the corpus annotation experiment. Finally, Section 6 provides conclusions.","The lack of standardization in the representation of ATE corpora constitutes a bottleneck for the evaluation of ATE tools. To address this issue, we proposed an RDF-based formalization that employs OntoLex-Lemon to represent termbases and NIF to represent corpora. We showed that these formats are able to represent the wide range of linguistic and conceptual phenomena that characterize terminology. In addition, we developed a small corpus about waste management legislation in order to provide an example of the proposed formalization. In future, we plan to convert the major ATE corpora into the proposed format, to further improve ATE standardization. Moreover, we intend to increase the size and quality of the small ATE corpus we developed.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The PBSDS serves as a resource for studying pseudoprofound bullshit, exploring potential linguistic factors in perceiving bullshit. The dataset’s creation and experiments with classifiers show promising results, despite limitations such as selection bias and subjective annotation.","“Bullshit"" refers to communication that is designed to impress but is constructed without concern for truth [1]. Bullshit differs from lying in that the liar deliberately manipulates and subverts truth (usually with the intent to deceive), while the bullshitter is simply unconcerned with what is true and what is false. A liar needs to know the truth value of a proposition; the bullshitter simply does not care. Although bullshit comes in different forms, in this project, we focused specifically on what is referred to as “pseudoprofound bullshit,"" which is designed to convey some sort of potentially profound meaning but is actually semantically vacuous [2], e.g., “Hidden meaning transforms unparalleled abstract beauty."" Table 1 reports further examples of pseudoprofound bullshit and nonpseudoprofound bullshit sentences from our dataset. The goal of this project is to construct a dataset of tweets that contain pseudoprofound bullshit in English (the PBSDS). Operating under the assumption that bullshit is similar to spam email, we hypothesize that it should be possible to detect pseudoprofound bullshit using relatively simple classification algorithms.","Despite its limitations, the PBSDS offers valuable insights into the phenomenon of pseudoprofound bullshit and its detection. The dataset provides a foundation for further research, enabling comprehensive investigations into linguistic patterns, cognitive biases, and societal implications associated with pseudoprofound bullshit.

In other words, a metaphor corresponds to using a word or phrase from the context in which it is expected to occur to another context, where it is not expected to occur [1]. Metaphors are ubiquitous in language [2]: they cannot only be considered a pure artistic ornament that exclusively pertains to literary discourse, but they are essential for the development of language and culture [3, 4, 5]. Much work has been devoted to discussing the metaphor identification and interpretation process, as in [6]. In this sense, a qualitative approach represents the safest methodology since metaphors regard an aspect of language that occasionally can be ambiguous. For example, two speakers from the same linguistic and cultural context can interpret the same metaphor differently. However, this approach is time-consuming and requires at least more than two human coders to be effectively reliable. Despite this phenomenon, it remains a computationally hard task given the many structural problems that make automatic identification not quickly effective [7]. Scholars between digital humanities and computational linguistics have developed different approaches to support automatic identification. Indeed, the recent improvements regarding artificial intelligence and machine learning might consistently impact metaphor research regarding the time and quantity of analyzed text [8]. From a computational point of view, metaphor identification is a particular case of text classification. The recent literature on general text classification, particularly metaphor identification, is quite broad and includes both top-down approaches [9] and bottom-up ones. Top-down approaches start from a human-designed theory of the phenomenon, which is later digitalized to provide automatic identification. Bottom-up, or data-driven ones, on the other hand, aim to perform identification starting from a dataset of examples. Bottom-up strategies can be, in turn, separated into symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches. Sub-symbolic approaches, commonly realized via several types of neural networks, produce black-box models which in some cases can be very accurate [10]. Along with the application of pre-trained and large language models they currently are a de-facto standard for text-related learning tasks, and quite a lot of results exist even in the narrow field of metaphor identification (see, among many others, [11, 10, 12, 13, 14]). Conversely, the purpose of a symbolic approach is to provide an identification model and a statistically validated theory of the phenomenon, written in a suitable logical language. While symbolic systems are sometimes used for text-related tasks in general, their application to the case of metaphor identification needs to be addressed. In this paper, we provide the theoretical bases for a symbolic approach to text classification, particularly metaphor identification, that generalizes the existing ones and is inspired by similar generalizations of symbolic approaches to learning models for non-text-related tasks.","This work represents an initial attempt to approach symbolic learning for text-related tasks like metaphor detection. A symbolic approach can extract a theory from a specific linguistic phenomenon, which raises at least three problems: first, determining whether a theory of a phenomenon should exist and in what terms; second, finding the appropriate logic for the extraction process; and third, ensuring the existence of an automatic method for extracting the theory in that logic. In this work, we have attempted to address the first and second points, and we did so using a logical formalism for which a solution to the third one already exists. Should this approach be successful, it can be used to address other text-related challenges, such as all variants of text classification. Additionally, our generalized 2-gram encoding can be further generalized to partially benefit from well-known word-to-vec approaches without compromising its symbolic essence. We will further verify our hypotheses by conducting some tests on an annotated newspaper corpus, which was human-labeled as metaphor or non-metaphor, consisting of 13,000 tokens and 2,000 different words. The label pertains to the entire text, and the task will regard recognizing its metaphoric expressions.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

PAC (i.e., ProAna/Anorexia Corpus) and RAC (i.e., Recovery from Ana/Anorexia Corpus) resources focus on the contents posted on TikTok, respectively, by communities promoting anorectic behavior and users sharing experiences concerning the process of recovery from their ED. We report on the corpus statistics and creation process, focusing specifically on the methodological issues raised by this novel Social Media platform.","It was only 20 years ago that one of the darkest sides of Eating Disorders (ED) was revealed through the proliferation of websites, blogs, and social networks, in which a growing number of adolescents and young adults started sharing information about their eating experiences with like-minded users. Among these pro-ED communities, researchers and clinicians showed particular concern for pro-Ana (i.e., “pro-anorexia”) groups, i.e., web-based communities of anorexic (or aspiring anorexic) individuals engaged in the promotion of their Eating Disorder [1]. Interestingly, one of the most horrific and dangerous aspects of pro-Ana groups is that Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is not presented as a psychiatric disorder associated with pathological body image dissatisfaction [2], but more as a way of living with its own rules and rituals to be respected. While over the last years, much has been done to prevent the circulation of pro-ED content on social media (e.g., TikTok’s adoption of measures to obscure harmful contents: [3]), a new but specular phenomenon recently took the toll, that is, the spread of pro-recovery accounts of individuals who are in the process of healing from an ED and are willing to share their eating experience to help other online users [4]. From a linguistic perspective, research on ED has been very limited and became an object of study only in recent years [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] as opposed to other psychopathologies, such as schizophrenia [11, 12], personality disorder [13], and depression [14, 15, 16, 17]. This already problematic picture has been further compromised by the inhomogeneous representation of linguistic data in the literature, where the majority of studies have been dedicated to the linguistic profiling of ED-affected individuals in a Germanic language (English, German, Norwegian) [18]. This paper represents a small step towards the reversal of this tendency but a crucial part of two larger projects (Metaphan1 and RaAM project 2022) aiming at identifying, by the adoption of different NLP techniques and tools, potential lexical and semantic patterns in anorectic individuals. To this end, in the current research, we show the data collection process (i.e., oral and written productions) from ED communities on TikTok, currently representing the most widely used social media among young people and adolescents, namely the population groups at greater risk for EDs. In the following paragraphs, we give a brief overview of the literature on the topic (Section 2), then we describe the process of creating the corpus and discuss the methodological issues that were met (Section 3) and to conclude we provide few insights for future works (Section 4).","The aim of this work was twofold: on the one hand, we wanted to present two corpora on EDs, the English pro-Ana corpus (PAC) and the Italian pro-Recovery corpus (RAC), that were both built by extracting data from the popular SM TikTok; on the other, we wanted to discuss some methodological issues related to building a corpus using this platform as a source of data. More specifically, we pointed out that the absence of an official API does not allow the automatic extraction of the videos and requires manual work, which is highly time-consuming and does not allow to collect a very large sample of data. This, in turn, might impede the application of more complex computational analysis and limit the generalizability of the results. In addition, we raised the issue related to the transcription of the videos to text. In this case, implementing automatic approaches is not always feasible because of the extreme visual complexity and variability of TikTok videos. Given the highly interactive nature of this SM and its unprecedented success, we believe that TikTok constitutes an extremely interesting source of linguistic and non-linguistic data that could be used to analyze other complex social and psychological phenomena and we hope that this work paves the way for further research in this direction.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Since the transition from the absolute monarchy to the parliamentary monarchy, that took place in 1848, Italy went through historical events such as two world wars, the fascist dictatorship, the exile of the royal family, the universal suffrage, the accession to the European Union, and much more. Such important milestones, along with all the rest of the Italian political and social life, are traced in the parliamentary reports.

The improvements with respect to a preliminary version of the algorithm are related to a more granular definition of the functional categories and a significant reduction in lexical ambiguity. These results might constitute a substantial baseline for (very) large language models assessment in terms of descriptive adequacy [5].","The advent of large language models (LLMs), especially those based on pre-trained transformers (GPT-like, [6]) demonstrated the impressive capability of next-token prediction task in training. This prediction is largely based on expectations of various kinds (morphosyntactic, semantic, and inferential) that, in virtue of a well-tuned attention mask mechanism can generalize categorial constraints across word sequences, apparently, without significant distance or directionality limitations among tokens, though the number of tokens accepted in input at each iteration remains fixed. This represents a clear difference with respect to recurrent networks training (e.g., LSTM, [7]) which benefits from a more cognitively plausible working memory mechanism that tries to preserve a sound incremental processing also modeling “backward dependencies” (i.e., when β depends on α, but β linearly precedes α). It has been demonstrated however that these new generation attention-based transformers are computationally very intensive [8] and their performance on various linguistic datasets demonstrates the implausibility of their linguistic generalizations [9]. In a recent study, Wilcox, Futrell & Levy [10] demonstrate the impressive ability of certain recurrent networks (JRNN and GRNN) to model islands constraints in a way that is comparable (or even better, sometimes) to that of larger LMs such as GTP-3. These results, apparently, not only challenge the poverty of stimulus hypothesis [5], but also suggest that, as far as linguistic competence is concerned, models with a smaller number of parameters (and a different architecture) might be more efficient in learning a human-like linguistic competence. What is then the minimum model size we might afford to maintain this high level of meta-linguistic competence? In this paper, to address the “minimum model size problem,” we stress the relevance of a cognitively plausible expectation mechanism (model architecture) that benefits from explicit modeling of (at least) certain categorial constraints (minimum number of parameters needed). Expectation-based Minimalist Grammars (e-MGs, [11]), for instance, simply rely on the notion of satisfied local selection (through categorial features) to identify a successful local dependency or the requirement to be satisfied through a non-local one. The advantages are (i) the complete transparency of this model compared to a cognitively plausible grammatical theory [12] and (ii) the computational complexity cost in recognition which grows polynomially to the length of the sentence (unless specific parameterization to extend empirical coverage is adopted, [1]). A possible disadvantage of this approach is related to the fact that a fully explicit lexicon is required to run the recognition or the generation algorithm. Based on [13], this work extends the proposed algorithm to retrieve a large-scale lexicon from annotated datasets such as UD treebanks. In Section 2, we will introduce the critical aspects of this procedure, essentially focusing on the directionality of each dependency and on the inherent lexical ambiguity obtained by applying a naïf lexicon extraction procedure. In Section 3, we propose a refinement of the extraction approach, and we will calculate the efficiency of this new method in terms of reduction of lexical and syntactic ambiguity and, overall, lexicon size. Section 4 will conclude this paper by suggesting further improvements to be evaluated in the future.","These preliminary results are encouraging and demonstrate, on the one hand, that structural ambiguity can be reasonably reduced by assuming properly crafted linguistic generalizations, while, on the other hand, valency-based theories [29] are less accurate and induce an unwanted level of ambiguity that can be readily avoided. More work needs to be done at least in the following direction: lexical items are considered as atomic entities. As demonstrated by the efficacy of word embeddings based on sub-word units (notably the byte-pair encoding, [30,31]), this step is more than necessary (and doable in the current e-MG framework, see [32]). Returning to the original consideration of how these results can serve as a baseline for LLM assessment, there is at least one possible approach we consider: if explicit categorial expectations are implicitly represented in LLMs, then the number of features needed in the lexicon should be considered as the minimal dimensionality required for word embedding. As far as structural constraints are concerned, this should represent the lowest number of parameters (i.e., levels of abstraction/representation) for the lexical item. Although no lexical semantic considerations are addressed here (even though the categorial approach is, in principle, also tenable from the semantic compositional perspective), specific generalizations should be obtainable both with e-MGs and with LLMs of comparable size in terms of parameters (i.e., roughly corresponding to the number of categories expected or required by the e-MGs lexicon). The phenomena to be tested should include island violations (e.g., “*what did John read the book that was talking about?”), thematic selection constraints (e.g., “*John put,” “*John eats a sandwich to Mary”), etc., along the lines, for instance, of [33] or [9]. If more parameters (where “more” corresponds to at least one order of magnitude) are needed to perform similarly to e-MGs on these constraints, we might conclude that LLMs still need some “optimization” since they do not yet qualify as efficient and descriptively adequate.",1,Language Models

However, real-world tasks require agents that are embodied in the environment and can collaborate with humans by following language instructions. In this work, we focus on ALFRED, a large-scale instruction-following dataset designed to develop artificial agents that can execute both navigation and manipulation actions in 3D simulated environments. We present a new Natural Language Understanding component for Embodied Agents as well as an in-depth error analysis of model failures for this challenge, going beyond the success-rate performance that has been driving progress on this benchmark. Furthermore, we provide the research community with important directions for future work in this field, which are essential to the development of collaborative embodied agents.","In recent years, we have witnessed tremendous improvements in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks thanks to powerful Large Language Models (e.g., [1, 2, 3]). These models are trained by leveraging internet-scale textual data. However, with access to text only, they utilize only a portion of the rich multi-modal training data available from interactions with the world and other agents [4]. Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI) is the field of AI focused on developing agents that can perceive the environment through multi-modal inputs and execute actions in the world. Many benchmarks have been proposed in EAI. For example, Vision+Language Navigation [5] aims to study the ability of EAI agents to follow natural language instructions in 3D simulated environments. However, the agent can only output navigation actions, limiting the richness of concepts it can learn. To simulate a scenario closer to real-world use of these systems, Shridhar et al. [6] propose ALFRED, a new instruction-following benchmark that facilitates the study of situated language understanding, visual memory, commonsense reasoning, and long-term action planning. So far, progress on ALFRED has been driven by accuracy-based metrics on the official leaderboard (e.g., [7, 8, 9, 10]). However, given that the success rate on this benchmark remains below production-level performance (~40%), a more in-depth analysis of model failures is warranted. In this paper, we make two main contributions: 1) we train a novel Natural Language Understanding component for an EAI agent using multi-task learning that achieves a 0.117 error rate on the ALFRED validation unseen set, an improvement over the model proposed by Min et al. [7]; 2) we provide an in-depth analysis of our model’s failures, highlighting gaps in critical situated language understanding capabilities essential for EAI agents, such as referential expression resolution and conversational grounding [11].","In this work, we used the ALFRED dataset as a benchmark to investigate the language understanding abilities of state-of-the-art EAI models. We began by improving the model originally proposed by Min et al. [7] through multi-task learning, demonstrating that even with this new model, several issues remain unresolved. We categorized these problems into different classes to facilitate our analysis, leading us to conclude that an EAI agent must leverage multi-modal signals, commonsense knowledge, and user interaction to effectively solve embodied tasks. According to Schlangen [21], situated interaction is a direct, purposeful encounter between free and independent, yet similar agents. Following this definition, in ALFRED tasks, there are two distinct agents: a follower and a leader. The leader acts as an oracle, providing instructions in one go without engaging in dialogue with the follower and assuming that the follower possesses perfect capabilities to follow instructions without accounting for uncertainty or possible errors. Additionally, there is no concept of conversational grounding, which is intended as a joint activity where both agents negotiate meanings necessary to solve the task effectively and efficiently. In this regard, while the ALFRED dataset presents a challenging task, it falls short of providing a benchmark suitable for developing artificial agents capable of collaboratively solving tasks through natural language.",1,Language Models

TextRank is a well-known algorithm for automatic extractive summarization. This work introduces SentiTextRank, an emotional variant of TextRank, designed to enhance extractive summarization for both single-document and multi-document contexts. SentiTextRank incorporates emotions into the summarization process by classifying sentences into the eight emotional categories defined in SenticNet. Preliminary evaluations of SentiTextRank show promising results; in particular, our method generates informative summaries composed of sentences that maintain the emotional content of the original document.","Summarization is the process of reducing a larger body of information into a concise and coherent summary that captures the essential points and main ideas. Extractive summarization involves selecting and combining sentences or phrases directly from the source text to form the summary [1] and plays an important role in condensing news articles into concise summaries, allowing readers to quickly grasp the key information. Traditional extractive methods primarily rely on lexical word distance to select important sentences for summarization. In many cases the emotional aspects found in the documents are not considered in summarization, and this can affect how readers engage with and understand the information. Sentiment analysis is the extraction of subjective information from text, encompassing emotions and opinions, and the classification based on the expressed emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, or surprise, to capture the overall emotional sentiment [2] and [3]. Sentiment analysis had a huge impact on many applications of NLP in the last years, but there is still space for understanding the details of its implementations [4]. The current study employs SenticNet [3], a multidisciplinary approach to opinion mining that lies at the intersection of affective and common-sense computing. This approach integrates elements from semiotics, psychology, linguistics, and machine learning. Unlike statistical sentiment analysis, Sentic computing focuses on preserving the semantic representation of natural language concepts and sentence structure. The foundation of SenticNet is the Hourglass of Emotions, an emotion categorization model designed to accurately express the affective information present in natural language text. To the best of our knowledge, sentiment generation is an understudied argument in the field of automatic summarization. Despite the advancements in text summarization techniques, there is a gap in research when it comes to considering emotions in the process. However, we believe that there are a number of applications in which the emotions in a summary should correspond to the emotions of the original document(s). For instance, this is the case of meta-reviews in conference management or the summarization of product reviews in the case of e-commerce. For these application domains, it is important to consider emotions to create summaries that truly reflect the essence of the source texts. In this paper, by incorporating sentiment scoring between sentences, we generate summaries that capture the emotional tone and impact of the original text. We believe that exploring this aspect further would lead to more comprehensive and effective text summarization methods. This paper has two main goals. First, we define a new algorithm called SentiTextRank, which is an emotional variant of TextRank [5]. Second, we provide an initial evaluation of SentiTextRank by considering two automatic metrics based on content distance. Note that modern LLMs showed some abilities in summarizing texts by using a specific style, with some limitations in producing a summary that is truly extractive. Moreover, LLMs showed also a big impact from the point of view of the required computational resources. We believe that the work presented in this paper, that requires just few hours to conduct all the experiments, can be seen as a cheap (in many senses) alternative to the use of modern expensive (in many senses) LLMs1. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we define the new SentiTextRank algorithm, in Section 3 we report the result of a first experimental evaluation of the SentiTextRank algorithm and the Section 4 ends the paper pointing out to work in progress.","This paper introduces the SentiTextRank algorithm, which integrates emotions into the extractive summarization process to create more informative and emotionally rich summaries. The experimental results are encouraging with respect to the effectiveness of SentiTextRank in capturing factual information. The ongoing work on SentiTextRank is following different directions. First, we want to design a new version of the algorithm that will not be based on the classification of a sentence in one single prevalent emotion. The idea that we want to develop is to define one single measure that combines both content and emotion similarities. By using this combined measure, we can apply the original TextRank algorithm on the entire set of sentences from the source(s) and obtain one single ranking structure accounting for both content and emotion. Second, we want to conduct more extensive experiments also on datasets from different domains. In particular, we are considering medical applications since the affective component of medical information can represent a relevant biopsychosocial feature [12]. Third, we are aware that automatic metrics not always measure a real quality of the summarized text with respect to human judgment [13, 14]. So, we plan in future to conduct human-based evaluation too.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

It is good for a person to be honored for e.g. some achievement and we know in advance that such an achievement is expected to have positive polarity. Also, there is a positive relation between the honorer and the honoree. We introduce an Italian verb lexicon that specifies the polar relations a verb expresses and the effects and expectations that the roles of the verb bear.","A sentence is not just positive or negative, it moreover sheds a (polar) light on its participants. Given a sentence like I mourn my freedom (It. Piango la mia libertà), a negative effect is cast on the subject and we expect a positive filler of the direct object. Furthermore, we might conclude that the subject is in favour of the object. We have created an Italian verb lexicon comprising 307 verbs with up to 3 frames per verb in order to enable such kind of inferences. Such a lexicon might be useful for stance detection or even for lexicon induction (e.g. from the object expectation of mourn we can conclude that libertà is a positive concept). In this short paper, we discuss the ingredients of our lexicon both from a practical and theoretical point of view.","In this paper, we have described an Italian verb lexicon and the theory behind it. The lexicon specifies for each Italian verb the underlying relation (in favour or against) and for each verb argument the effects and expectations (if any). The resource has been released together with a traditional polarity lexicon (nouns, adjectives). The verb lexicon can be used for sentiment inference, finding out who is in favour of or against who or what. This is useful e.g. for the profiling of political parties: are they in favour or against some topic. Also, the polar perspective which we call effects can be determined: to answer the question whether a text is positive or negative towards an animate or inanimate object. This enables to determine the stance of a text author, but also can be used in order to find out how a person or a product is framed e.g. in a particular text or text collection.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"
574_2023,2023,,"Olga Loginova, Raffaella Bernardi",The Inherence of Telicity: Unveiling Temporal Reasoning in Video Question Answering,ENG,2,2,1,"Università di Trento, CIMeC",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Trento,"Video question answering (VQA) requires models to understand video-related questions and generate natural language answers. In multiple-choice VQA, models must associate visual content with one of several predetermined answers. As videos often encompass intricate events and actions unfolding over time, these models must possess the ability to reason across multiple frames and discern the relationships between them with respect to the answers. This paper focuses on the Answerer component of a multiple-choice VQA model, which predicts answers using language-infused key frames. We hypothesise that the Answerer’s capacity for temporal reasoning is closely intertwined with its understanding of aspectuality. To investigate this, we augment NeXT-QA, a VQA dataset for causal and temporal reasoning, with annotations for telicity. We then delve into the performance evaluation of SeViLA, a state-of-the-art multiple-choice VQA model, on it. Our findings demonstrate that the model generally exhibits correct handling of aspects, albeit with a bias that is inherent in human nature.","Temporal ordering of actions and events is not solely determined by time; it is also influenced by causality. The organisation of activities in episodic memory is established based on contingency, where one activity triggers another [1]. Recognising cause-effect relationships is essential for temporal understanding, as causes typically precede effects. A cause that has reached its culmination induces the effect. In language, linguistic aspects play a role in how activities unfold and whether they have culminated. The concept of telicity marks the endpoint of an activity: a verb phrase with a clear endpoint is considered telic (e. g., “to pick up something""), while an atelic one is ongoing, without a specific endpoint (e. g., “to clap""). In descriptions of a sequence of activities with the resultative structure there is an evident human bias towards telic interpretation [2]. Previous research explored telicity for textual transformer-based [3] models, showing that they can classify activities based on duration and telicity with an accuracy surpassing 80% [4]. Such performance at a level comparable to humans, even with limited training data, indicates their ability to capture temporal reasoning through aspect classification. Our work extends this line of research to video-language models, where video content comes with text labels assigned to key frames or the whole video. Ordering of events corresponds to changing frames, making the correct key frame extraction critical for temporal reasoning. Action timestamps to the frames provide additional cues for temporal reasoning. We propose a study that focuses on contemporary video question-answering (VQA) models in order to explore the relevance of telicity for answering temporal questions related to simultaneous and consecutive activities. We consider the aspects of question’s both main and dependent clauses. To achieve this, we annotate1 the test set of NExT-QA [5], widely used for causal and temporal reasoning benchmarks, with telicity and evaluate the SeViLA model [6] on this annotated dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such endeavor in the VQA field. Figure 1 provides an example of NExT-QA temporal questions with our telicity annotation: SeViLA selects the telic answer “pick up toy"" (in bold) that does not match the ongoing nature of the question’s main clause “is ... doing"", while in the correct answer “clap"" (boxed) there is a match of atelic activities. Our findings demonstrate that the VQA model SeViLA can effectively handle telicity. Furthermore, when making a mistake in prediction the model, like humans, tends to adopt a telic-prone approach.","The linguistic models grounded in cognitive research highlight a tendency for individuals to remember causally linked activities. Sequential actions and events are associated with the idea that the culmination of one activity sets off another. This culmination is closely tied to the internal structure of the activity which is expressed in language through aspects and, in particular, telicity. Using NExT-QA dataset, we revealed that VQA models, such as SeViLA, generally capture the contrast in durative and endpoint activities at a human level. Whereas they mostly tend to predict correct telicity for causal and temporal reasoning, their inherent erroneous implication of culminated activity, in essence, aligns with human intuition. This revelation prompts us to answer the follow-up question: to what extent the improvement in matching telicity in questions and answers will amplify the key frame extraction for correct answering in multiple-choice VQA models.",1,Language Models

The model is trained on a corpus of spoken language and a corpus of written language annotated with Multiword expressions, then tested on two other corpora (one written and one spoken). This methodology provides very good results regarding Precision.","Multiword expression (MWE) is a term used to refer to groups of words that display formal or functional idiosyncratic properties with respect to free word combinations, and therefore behave like a unit [1]. This notion encompasses a wide set of linguistic phenomena, of both semantic and syntactic nature, like idioms, verb-particle constructions, complex nominals, and support verb constructions. The computational treatment of MWEs notoriously poses a challenge in NLP [2], but in recent years a lot of effort has been put into the development of techniques and tools for the identification of MWEs in corpora. These are almost exclusively derived from, and tested on, written corpora. This leaves the study of MWEs in spoken varieties of languages, including Italian, a rather unexplored field. Given the major differences between spoken and written language, we deemed it important to establish how an MWEs automatic extraction tool trained on written corpus performs on a spoken one, also considering the lack of specific resources for spoken corpora. We have decided to conduct an experiment training a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model [3] to identify MWEs. The model was trained on both a corpus of spoken and one of written Italian; the two models obtained were then tested on corpora of spoken and written Italian, and their performances were evaluated. In § 2 we give an overview of existing research on MWEs and related resources for Italian; in § 3 we describe the resources used to build the training and test corpora; in § 4 we described the methodology followed to annotate the training corpora with MWEs and the testing; results of the experiment are presented in § 5 and discussed in § 6.","Results obtained show a great performance overall for both of the models, given the high value for Precision for all four of the corpora tagged. However, considering also the number of MWE occurrences tagged, we can see that the spoken model performed the worst on PAISÀ, having the lowest Precision and number of occurrences, while better results are achieved on the same corpus by the written model. On IMAGACT, both of the models performed very well, with the written model having the best Precision overall but slightly fewer occurrences of MWEs found. We have also counted the number of MWEs tagged (per lemmas) in IMAGACT, and how many of these were ""new"" compared to the ones annotated in the training corpora. The spoken model tagged 222 MWEs (per lemmas) of which 63 were new (28.4%) and the written model tagged 224 MWEs (per lemmas), 64 being new (28.6%), so the models performed similarly in this regard too. A slight difference in performance can be noted comparing Precision in tagging new MWEs: new MWEs found by spoken model account for a total of 119 occurrences, 46 of which results correctly tagged; new MWEs found by written model account for 123 occurrences, 60 of which are correctly tagged. In conclusion, the results of this experiment show that on spoken corpora ’written models’ perform similarly to ’spoken models’; this looks really promising, considering the lack of resources dedicated to MWEs in spoken language. Future works in this line of research include the computing of Recall for the models and qualitative evaluation of the MWEs extracted.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We present an evaluation resource for It-LLMs tuned in Italian to address these challenges. Our proposal includes evaluating models on several aspects. We take a holistic approach to analyzing model performance factors, including the pre-training base, instruction-tuning data, and training methods. Our results reveal that data quality is the most crucial factor in scaling model performance. While available open-source models demonstrate impressive ability, they present problems when customized adapters are used. We are encouraged by the rapid development of models by the open-source community. However, we also highlight the need for rigorous evaluation to support the claims.","The advent of Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (It-LLMs) marks yet another change in NLP in the last few decades.

Examples include GPT-4, which demonstrates abilities in language comprehension and common sense, logical-mathematical problem solving, law, and medicine. However, despite their remarkable competence and adaptability, the full extent of their potential has yet to be fully understood. Indeed, their direction is poorly captured, given many models’ simple use, black-box nature, and lack of in-depth and holistic evaluation studies [1, 2, 3]. To manage these challenges and deeper understand the abilities of these models, a series of evaluation benchmarks were introduced that are explicitly designed for the comprehensive evaluation of It-LLMs [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. However, evaluation resources are only available in English, and it is tricky and misleading to evaluate a model trained on instructions in the Italian language.

However, pre-training on large amounts of data can also cause the representation of harmful biases. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying the presence of gender bias using a list of occupations characterized by a large imbalance between the number of male and female employees.","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved superhuman performances in several NLP applications [1, 2]. They demonstrate a clear upward performance trend along with the increasing model size and pretraining data, namely scaling law [3]. However, by overhumanizing learning abilities, it is possible that these LLMs inherit stereotypical associations between social groups and professions [4, 5]. Bias or, better, prejudice [6] is the sword of Damocles of fairness in many data-driven applications, such as facial recognition [7] or recommendation systems [8]. Even in modern NLP, a clear presence of bias in different models has been observed. Bolukbasi et al. [4] detected the presence of stereotypical biases in word embedding vectors measuring association between gender and certain professions, while Caliskan et al. [9] proposed the Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) to assess the strength of stereotypical associations regarding gender and races. Similar biases were later observed in Pretrained Language Models. Several benchmarks like SEAT [10], StereoSet [11], and CrowS-Pairs [12] enable testing of Pre-trained Language Models like BERT [13] and ELMo [14]. The advent of LLMs [1, 15, 16, 17] has yet to alleviate this phenomenon. In fact, despite the increasing capabilities of this family of models, the underlying LLMs generate toxic or offensive content [18, 19], and reproduce biases that exist in the training data [20, 21, 22]. While some models can be used in beneficial applications, like in identifying biased texts [23], biases hidden within these models could hinder their abilities [6]. For these reasons, while some previous work quantifies the ability of the models to cause no harm by interviewing human evaluators [24], it is necessary to develop automated approaches to easily test models before they are available to a large group of users. In this paper, we analyze how existing LLMs capture some known stereotyped associations between gender and profession for the Italian language. To quantify the presence of social bias, we created a test dataset (Section 2.1) that allows us to monitor the relation between gender and 171 different occupations. We selected professions that, according to ISTAT data, have a significant imbalance in the number of male employees compared to the number of female employees in Italy. Then, we propose a method to measure the strength of the association between gender and profession (Section 2.2) on different LLMs. Stemming from the stereotype score definition that can be found in Nadeem et al. [11], we define a model biased as it systematically prefers the stereotyped association over an anti-stereotyped one. Finally, we test several LLMs trained on the Italian language and attest that a large number of LLMs available for the Italian language have strong gender biases (Section 3).","In this work, we propose to investigate gender bias for the Italian language in pre-trained LLMs, identifying if and to what extent these models capture real-world imbalances while training on text data. We present a list of professions inspired by official ISTAT data and propose a simple and effective method to quantify the presence of gender bias in occupations. We assess the presence of strong biases across different model families such as BLOOM, LLaMA, and XGLM.",21,Gender and Inclusive Language Studies

Amongst the notable resources are worth mentioning Italian Function Words (IFWs)4 and Italian Content Words (ICWs)5, two lists in JSON Lines format developed for supporting POS tagging and syntactic parsing of Italian. In fact, a number of NLP tasks can take advantage of lexical resources, for example sentiment analysis [2] but also “semantic role labeling, verb sense disambiguation and ontology mapping” [3]. However, ICWs includes hundreds of thousands of forms generated automatically and not manually revised, which, despite being morphologically correct, have very low, if not zero, usage frequency. Although not listed in Clarin’s VLO, we also mention SIMPLELex-it, since built similarly to our lexicon by combining various existing resources [4]. Even in lexical resources which have been manually developed and revised, however, the linguistic coverage of entries can pose problems, both in terms of lexical coverage and content of entries. Hence, integrating information from different sources, as we did in this work, can be effective in filling the gaps, though it can present several challenges in terms of harmonization of distinct formats and models. We here describe the first steps towards the construction of a new computational lexicon for the Italian language that we called CompL-it. We started from the enrichment of an existing resource, LexicO6 [5], a computational lexicon which, in turn, was derived from the already cited PSC lexicon. In particular, this first phase was focused on the expansion of the morphological layer, carried out through the integration of two other resources: a list of lemmatized forms generated by the morphological analyzer MAGIC7 [6, 7], and a set of Italian treebanks. The obtained resource, constituted of nearly 800 thousand forms, was made available in a CoNLL-like format as a tabular separated values (or TSV)8. This core of forms, lemmas, and morphological traits will populate the morphological layer of the computational lexicon CompL-it under construction, which will later be released in the form of Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) (see Section 5). For this reason, it was chosen not to update the relational database of LexicO, but to use the CoNLL-like format as a temporary data representation format.","In this article, we documented a first step towards building a new computational lexicon of Italian. A set of approximately 800 thousand lemmatized forms with morphological features was created, through the integration of existing resources. In the next phases, this lexical core will be converted as a LLOD based on the OntoLex-lemon model, making the resulting lexicon more easily shareable, interoperable, and compliant with Semantic Web standards. Additionally, new linguistic layers will be added, starting from semantics, by using the information already available in LexicO and by integrating data from WordNets for Italian.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Moreover, the dataset includes the level of confidence with which the annotators could write the explanation, and in cases where the annotators did not agree with the original label, an alternative label, along with an explanation for the new label. This offers the opportunity to analyse cases of uncertainty in annotation and delve into different perspectives on language understanding.","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) like T5 [1], GPT-3.5/4 [2], LLama-2 [3], It5 [4], and Camoscio [5] have demonstrated impressive performance across various natural language processing tasks. Despite their success, these LLMs also face limitations and risks, such as lack of factuality [6], hallucinations [7], and poor transparency [8]. As a result, there is a growing demand for ""inherent explainability,"" which refers to the ability of models to provide human-like, natural language explanations for their predictions. Many studies have thus focused on natural language explanations, and numerous datasets have been created for this purpose, primarily in English [9]. However, there is a notable gap for non-English languages, including Italian. To fill this void, this paper introduces the ’e-RTE-3-it’ dataset, the first Italian dataset for natural language inference enriched with free-form, human-written explanations for the relationship between two sentences. Additionally, the dataset includes alternative labels and confidence scores from annotators to account for the variability in human judgments. This aspect of the annotation scheme enhances the ’e-RTE-3-it’ dataset, making it a valuable resource for exploring subjectivity and variability in language understanding.","The insights derived from the ’e-RTE-3-it’ dataset pave the way for multifaceted research directions. The provided explanations can serve as a gold standard for training models to generate human-like explanations. Further, the alternative labels and explanations open avenues for investigating the subjectivity in language understanding. The rich layers of the dataset also allow for the study of correlation between the original and alternative labels, the confidence score, and the degree of disagreement among annotators. Future work includes utilizing the data to develop models capable of providing explanations for their entailment decisions and conducting a deeper analysis into the dynamics of subjectivity in the entailment task.",1,Language Models

To achieve this, we leveraged data from the Seshat project, annotated it following specific guidelines and then evaluated the consistency between three annotators. The classification experiments, with transformers and Large Language Models, show that 2 of 5 phases can be detected with good accuracy. We believe that this task could have a great impact on comparative history and can be helped by event extraction in NLP.","In the last decade, at least since Brexit AUTHOR, many countries in the world experienced a generalized polarization and phenomena of toxic language online have grown AUTHOR. Hate speech AUTHOR, misogyny AUTHOR, conspiracy theories AUTHOR and related phenomena are just visible manifestations of deep structural social crises, ushering in periods of shifting world order AUTHOR. While crises may appear sudden, they are often rooted in underlying factors like demographics, geopolitics, technological advancements, and historical-economic cycles. Using scientific method, mathematical modelling and the Structural Demographic Theory (SDT) AUTHOR it was possible to formalise secular cycles AUTHOR, that typically last between 75 to 100 years AUTHOR, and predict outbreaks of political instability in complex societies based on the rate of past crises AUTHOR. The SDT defines three actors and five phases of the secular cycle. The three key actors are: \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cycles.png \item The population, which is the source of the society's resources and manpower, represents approximately 90% of the entire society and is the part that follows instructions to produce goods and wealth, consuming only a small part of it. \item The elites, who typically cover around 8% of the society, are the groups of people in charge of finding potential solutions to the problems of the society and are eligible to become part of the state. Who is considered part of the elite and how someone gains or loses elite status depends on the type of government and the power dynamics within a society. \item The state, formed by roughly 2% of the society, is the government that enforces its will and manages resources from the population. It is composed by one or more elite groups, depending on the social structure, and it crystallizes the culture to keep the society alive. The actors interact in five phases during the secular cycle, progressively increasing social and political instability: \item The growth phase. During this phase a fresh and effective culture creates social cohesion, the economy is growing rapidly and the state is expanding its control over the population. This leads to increased economic prosperity and stability but raises the problem of sustainability. Periods of reconstruction immediately following wars, like post-war Italy in the 1950s, are examples of this phase. \item The population immiseration phase. The population continues to grow in number while the economy slows down. This happens because over the long term the rate of return on capital is typically greater than the growth rate of population salaries AUTHOR, as result the elites gets richer and the population gets poorer. Moreover, demography has a strong impact on the wealth of the population: the more workers of the same type are available, the less likely their wages are to grow. The state's ability to extract resources from the population reaches its limits in this phase. This can lead to increasing inequality, and social unrest begins. United States in the 1890s and 1970s are an example of this phase. \item The elite overproduction phase. The population tries to access the elite ranks but overloads the social lift mechanisms and yields a reduced capability of the elite to solve problems in the society, which raise the probability to have societal instability. USSR in the 1950s and US in the 1990s are examples of this phase. \item The state stress phase. The state's ability to govern the population and foster cooperation between population and elites begins to decline, and the elites become increasingly fragmented. This can lead to widespread violence and civil war. Moreover, the state tends to be in financial distress as a consequence of slowed economy and internal fragmentation, thus any triggering event that the state cannot manage can break into a crisis. Germany in the 1920s is an example. \item The crisis, collapse or recovery phase. The state is either reformed by the elites who find an agreement or overthrown by internal or external forces. At the end of this phase a new social equilibrium is found and a new period of stability begins, restarting the cycle. Examples are France in the 1790s, UK in the 1940s, US in the 1860s under civil war and also in 1930s under New Deal reforms. \centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{chronosnga.png The dynamics described by the SDT are represented in figure fig:cyc AUTHOR. SDT has been used to explain a wide range of historical events, including the French Revolution, the American Civil War AUTHOR, the fall of the Qing Dynasty AUTHOR, the Russian Revolution and the instability in the US in recent years. In this paper we propose a novel multi-class classification task: given a text describing the historical events of a decade, find the appropriate SDT phase label. To do so we exploited historical data from the Seshat project, produced textual descriptions for decades in the history of human societies and annotated each decade with SDT phases following specific annotation guidelines. We computed inter-annotator agreement between 3 annotators and experimented with LLMs in classification. The paper is structured as follows: in Section data we will describe the data, the guidelines for the annotation (Section annot), the classification experiments in Section experiments, the conclusion and direction for future work in Section conc.","We introduced a new classification task named historical phase recognition. We believe that, once we improve their performance, classification algorithms trained for this task will allow us to automatically annotate many more polities with secular cycles with a potential disruptive improvement in the study of comparative history. We believe that inter-annotator agreement can be further improved by having domain experts annotate the data. Additionally, the automatic extraction of events from short historical texts, or the definition of guidelines for their annotation, can be a valuable tool both in the annotation and classification tasks. By combining these two approaches, we can improve the dataset and make it more reliable. For the future we plan to improve the performance of classification by including the temporal interdependence factors, and to improve the inter annotator agreement, also calculating the agreement between labels generated by models and by humans. In the future it would be interesting to add event structure annotations such as TimeML in Chronos. %, and apply historical phase recognition from present day news headlines of different countries, The poor performance in zero-shot classification using an LLM is likely a function of the sophisticated reasoning and world knowledge required to perform the task. The LLM could benefit from more advanced prompting strategies (e.g. few-shot or chain-of-thoughts) or even supervision in the form of fine-tuning.

We analyzed posts to compare Blackout Tuesday discourse with #blacklivesmatter movement conversations. Using topic modeling, we identified dominant themes and counter-narratives in Blackout Tuesday and #blacklivesmatter captions. Using hashtag co-occurrence analysis, we investigate hashtag networks to situate the discourses within spheres of Instagram activism. Our findings indicate that both corpora share themes like ”calls to action”, but Blackout Tuesday posts are shorter and solidarity-focused, while #blacklivesmatter posts are longer and address white privilege more explicitly. #blacklivesmatter is linked to anti-racist activism hashtags, while Blackout Tuesday connects more with popular culture and #Alllivesmatter. This supports qualitative research on Blackout Tuesday’s performative allyship, adding a quantitative perspective to existing research.","The number of posts from the #blacklivesmatter move- ment (#blm) is estimated to be 28 million, which exempli- fies the movement’s impact on society [1, 2]. However, the popularity of the movement reached a peak when “Blackout Tuesday” (BT) took place, a digital memorial day on Instagram [1, 2]. BT was caused by a wave of outrage about the murder of George Floyd, an African American who was killed on May 25, 2020 by two white police officers in Minneapolis. The outrage was sparked by an 11-minute clip of the murder which went viral in social media. The video was posted in the context of the #blm movement and in a cultural setting where African Americans perceived law enforcement as agents of bru- tality [3]. To postulate solidarity with African Americans in their fight for racial justice, social media users posted a black square and added a post caption with the hash- tag #blackouttuesday. Given the cultural context, the video supported the perception of white police brutality, white supremacy, and systemic injustice against African Americans. While #blm needed years to gain a large international audience, BT reached millions within a day. The #blm movement has received significant attention in research and has had a strong impact on discussions in mainstream media; however, little attention has been paid to BT to date. Most existing research on BT has been conducted using interview studies and hermeneutic methodologies. In addition, there is one quantitative study by Chang et al. [7] which examines the contents of images, focusing on visual and geographic analyses. Because a large share of the posts related to BT feature a black tile rather than an image, it is also important to examine the text in the post, the caption. To fill this gap, this study used text mining to investi- gate the content of posts on BT. We examined the interre- lations between BT and #blm by applying topic modeling and hashtag co-occurrence analysis to both discourses within the same period of time. Our aim was to under- stand how BT has impacted the #blm discourse. We also wanted to compare the different types of discourse, as BT is a digital memorial day, whereas #blm is a new social movement.","Previous work has investigated visual aspects of BT, stud- ied posting motivations and the the role of celebrities, while we studied Instagram post captions [36, 37, 14]. We contrasted topics and hashtag co-occurences of the digital memorial event BT and the impactful movement #blm. We found that they share many similar topics, such as calls to action, mentions and thoughts of George Floyd, and connections to other antiracist movements. However, BT posts were posted from the solidarity per- spective, while #blm discourse broaches the issue of white privilege. Moreover, #blm is more closely related to other hashtags of Black activism, while BT posts are more fre- quently connected to posts related to popular culture, underscoring its place in mainstream micro-activism. Nevertheless, topic modeling results show that many BT posts seek to mobilize people or express solidarity to- wards the murder or police brutality (see figure 2, figure 1). We gain insight into networks of Black activism on Instagram. #blm is embedded in a network of anti-racist activism. Posts with the hashtag are on average more than twice as long and have a higher type-token ratio. In contrast, BT posts are shorter and contain many dif- ferent hashtags. Posts in various languages characterize the memorial day as an international event. BT is an international spark of outrage – and in its nature more superficial than #blm. We point to Wellman’s study, who investigates BT in the light of performative allyship [37]. Next to this, future work should compare the contents of #alllivesmatter and BT posts.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

In this work we focus on Fassa Ladin, a Rhaeto-Romance linguistic variety spoken by less than ten thousand people in the Dolomitic regions, and set to build the first bidirectional Machine Translation system supporting Italian, English, and Fassa Ladin. To this end, we collected a small though representative corpus compounding 1135 parallel sentences in these three languages, and spanning five domains. We evaluated several models including the open (Meta AI's No Language Left Behind, NLLB-200) and commercial (OpenAI's gpt-4o) state-of-the-art, and indeed found that both obtain unsatisfactory performance. We therefore proceeded to fine-tune the NLLB-200 model on the data collected, using different approaches. We report a comparative analysis of the results obtained, showing that 1) jointly training for multilingual translation (Ladin-Italian and Ladin-English) significantly improves the performance, and 2) knowledge-transfer is highly effective (e.g., leveraging similarities between Ladin and Friulian), highlighting the importance of targeted data collection and model adaptation in the context of low-resource/endangered languages for which little textual data is available.","The growing scale of Large Language Models, based on the Transformer architecture, has led to models with surprising capabilities in a number of tasks, including Machine Translation (MT). However, most of the NLP community effort is focused on high-resource standardized languages, leaving behind the vast majority of local under-resourced languages. Recent works have demonstrated the utility of creating language-specific datasets for MT AUTHOR and the effectiveness of relatively small quantities of high-quality translation data to teach a new language to pre-trained LLMs AUTHOR. To date, little work has addressed the Ladin language: even the most recent models that have included a great number of languages have not been trained with Ladin data AUTHOR, due to the scarcity of freely available parallel corpora (to our knowledge, only the OPUS corpora AUTHOR), which are also poorly curated -- e.g., wrong translations or mixed up Ladin varieties.\footnote{See Appendix. Further, previous works have mainly focused on the two South Tyrolean varieties, Gherdëina and Badiot AUTHOR: despite having a standardized written form and being officially recognized as a minority language, the Fassa variety (Fascian) has been mostly overlooked AUTHOR, while its speakers rightfully expect access to the same digital tools available for other languages AUTHOR. We introduce the first dataset of parallel Fassa Ladin-Italian-English sentences, spanning over multiple domains: literature, news, laws, brochures, and game rules. We evaluate several \emph{out-of-the-box translation systems, including the open (Meta AI's No Language Left Behind, NLLB-200) and commercial (OpenAI's gpt-4o) state-of-the-art models, and experiment with both \emph{zero-shot pivot-based and multilingual strategies to obtain satisfactory performances in bidirectional translation between Fassa Ladin and Italian/English. Figure \ref{fig:overview provides a schematic overview of our experiments, which are thoroughly described in Section. Our results show how the collection of small quantities of parallel data is very effective in `adding' support for a previously unsupported language to existing state-of-the-art models. More specifically, we find that the NLLB-200 model fine-tuned using a multilingual strategy can outperform even the most capable commercial LLMs (e.g., OpenAI gpt-4o). For reproducibility purposes, we make the dataset and code publicly available.","In this work, we show that it is possible to add a specific language variety to a pre-trained MT model using little amount of data for fine-tuning (fewer than 900 parallel sentences). To add Fassa Ladin, we fine-tune the model using as starting point a similar language included in NLLB-200: Friulian. This approach significantly improves the performance. Moreover, in such condition, fine-tuning with parallel sentences in more than two languages proves to help regularization and to improve translations, with respect to a \emph{zero-shot} pivot-based transfer learning approach. Future work includes extending the dataset with new resources and domains, improving the alignment quality, and including human evaluation of translation quality. Adding data from other Ladin varieties might be a viable solution to improve the low performance caused by unknown words. Moreover, experimenting with translated words from vocabulary entries could be beneficial for Fassa Ladin, a language variety that has scarce parallel data but various publicly accessible vocabularies.",10,Machine Translation

To assess the quality of the generated responses, we utilize an LLM evaluator. Our findings indicate that the multi-step approach significantly outperforms the zero-shot method, producing more comprehensive and accurate responses.","The advent of generative AI (GenAI), and specifically of large language models (LLMs), offers significant opportunities, among others, in the legal and financial sector, facilitating the implementation of innovative solutions across various domains of activities AUTHOR. One of the most promising applications is the business case for supporting the navigation and analysis of complex regulatory documents AUTHOR, which can be particularly valuable for compliance officers, legal teams, and other professionals working in financial institutions who need to have a clear and timely understanding of the regulations and the consequently derived obligations. Supervisory authorities could benefit from a tool that streamlines the consultation of complex legislation, providing swift responses to entities and enhancing efficiency AUTHOR. While LLMs offer advantages for this purpose, they also pose risks like bias and inaccuracies AUTHOR. Therefore, it is essential to establish strong verification procedures and retain human supervision to counter these risks. The complexity of regulatory documents, with their dense network of cross-referenced texts/cats and specialized content, necessitates careful analysis to retrieve the needed information ensuring at the same time effective risk management and limit the burden of such manual compliance. This study introduces a novel methodology to automate and expedite the ""question \& answer"" (Q\&A) process in regulatory compliance, leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate and timely responses to inquiries about the European Banking Authority’s (EBA) reporting regulations. Our multi-step approach aligns with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, enhancing context retrieval and generative capabilities through mechanisms like explicit extraction of Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) references, implicit reference analysis, and a dedicated cross-encoder for precise regulatory text retrieval. This methodology ensures tailored response generation suited to the complex regulatory compliance context, where precise and comprehensive answers are crucial. Our work finds particular applications within the domain of EBA regulatory reporting because it is characterized by a large and complex set of interrelated documents, including delegated and implementing acts, technical standards, guidelines, and recommendations, which cover various aspects of financial entities. Such complexity makes the business case both challenging and rewarding. In this work, we focus on Regulation (EU) N.2013/575, also called Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) URL, specifically on the topic of Liquidity Risk as a first use case to evaluate the potential benefit of enriched context for an accurate response generation. The main reason for this choice is that this topic is supported by a relatively limited number of regulatory documents, so it was a good starting point since the regulation is not readily available in the form of a structured dataset and its pre-processing is usually a time-consuming task. We used the actual EBA Q&As dataset AUTHOR as the foundation for developing a system capable of generating automated responses to questions formulated by analysts on EBA reporting requirements and rules. By harnessing the capabilities of LLMs we aim to create a tool that can deliver accurate and contextually relevant answers to any inquiry on the content of the CRR. Recent studies highlight the potential of LLMs for qualitative assessment AUTHOR. For this reason, in this work we also propose the use of an ""LLM Evaluator"" to automate the validation process. The structure of this paper is the following. Chapter methodology introduces the methodology and provides a detailed description of the approach adopted in this study; it explains the dataset utilized and the normative retrieval techniques employed to identify the regulatory documents necessary to address the EBA's Q\&As. Chapterjudege presents the LLM Evaluator and the evaluation criteria. Chapter experiments reports experimental results and results and presents the main outcomes of the study. Chapter challenges discusses challenges as well as potential areas for future developments.","This study explored a novel approach for generating automated responses to inquiries on the Regulation (EU) N.2013/575, specifically on the liquidity risk subject. We proposed a multi-step prompt construction method that enriches the context to be provided to LLMs, enabling them to generate more accurate and informative answers. An LLM Evaluator, which demonstrated strong agreement with human experts, was employed to compare our multi-step approach with standard zero-shot and few-shot methods that lack context enrichment. The quality of the generated responses was assessed, and our findings indicate that the multi-step approach significantly outperforms both the zero-shot and few-shot methods, resulting in responses that are more comprehensive and accurate in relation to the EBA regulation. These results suggest that the multi-step prompt construction is a promising approach for enhancing LLM performance in legal information retrieval tasks, particularly within domains with complex regulatory frameworks like regulatory reporting. Even at this early stage, the tool has demonstrated its ability to make the work of the human analyst more efficient. Future research directions include exploring the use of different LLM architectures and investigating alternative methods for incorporating human feedback into the prompt construction process. Lastly, exploring the generalization of this approach to other regulatory domains would be valuable.",20,In-domain IR and IE

Since this article reported a very small difference of scores in favour of the machines, the aim of the present work is to thoroughly analyse the data through four methods: scoring the uniqueness of the answers of one human or one machine compared to all the others, semantic similarity clustering, binary classification and manual inspection of the data. The results showed that humans and machines are on a par in terms of uniqueness scores, that humans and machines group in two well defined clusters based on semantics similarities between documents comprising all the answers of an individual (human or machine), per tasks and overall, and that the separate answers can be automatically classified in human answers and LLM answers with traditional machine learning methods, with F1 scores ranging from 68 to 74. The manual analysis supported the insight gained from the automated methods in that LLMs behave human-like while performing creativity tasks, but there are still some important distinctive features to tell them apart.","Creativity has made it possible for humanity to survive and develop since prehistoric times. Despite the perception that some people are more creative than others, many psychologists argue that everyone has the capacity for creativity or that creativity is innate and encoded in human nature AUTHOR. Creativity is inherently interdisciplinary, involving domains like psychology, cognitive sciences, philosophy, arts, engineering, mathematics, or computer science. Recently, it has become a field of interest in GenerativeAI (GenAI) AUTHOR in general, and in particular, in Large Language Models (LLMs) AUTHOR. However, much of the current research in generative models AUTHOR is concerned with constraining them so they do not harm people, so they are well-behaved, factual, non-hallucinating, non-biased, non-negative, non-misleading, non-toxic, etc., and for a good reason. In contrast, fewer studies (see section previousWork) focus on encouraging them to be original, unconstrained, or creative, although computational creativity, as a research field, dates back to the late '90s AUTHOR, AUTHOR with various disciplines including creative writing, music, or graphics, utilizing artificial intelligence, particularly neural networks, heuristics, and so on. A good survey on LLMs' verbal creativity is AUTHOR. Since work on LLMs creativity is just at the beginning, there is a need for methods, resources, and evaluation to better understand LLMs' creative abilities and their differences and similarities with human creative traits. In a recent article, AUTHOR designed a verbal creativity test, integrating a wide range of tasks and criteria inspired from psychological creativity testing, and administrating it to both humans and LLMs. The scope of this paper is to analyze the answers given by LLMs and human respondents to this previous study, for a direct comparison of human and machine verbal creativity. To this end, we will compute uniqueness scores, cluster the individual answers per task and overall, perform supervised binary classification with classic machine learning methods on all answers and manually analyze some of the data particularities.","This study showed that there are some differences between human and machine answers given to a verbal creativity test, but also plenty of similarities. The LLMs' answers vary much like the humans answers. Individual, unique answers, w.r.t. to the set of all answers are produced by both humans and machines alike, with no noticeable difference. Still, at a semantic level, humans and machines generally group together as individuals. The performance of automatic classification between human and machine answers is moderate and leaves room for improvement. The general findings of this study indicate that LLMs' creative capabilities are comparable with human abilities and, as such, they could be put to good use in the creative domain. Humans ""just"" need to adapt to their usage, mind the ethics and safety issues, and discern the information at every step, instead of blindly using them. In future work, we will focus on expanding the dataset, by adding more LLMs' and humans' answers to the test, for a better statistical coverage. Also, we aim to manually investigate more in-depth the database, to look for more systematic patterns for both humans and machines. As creativity remains a domain with endless possibilities, we also plan to investigate other aspects of LLMs' creativity, such as language or image. Another future approach worthy of pursuing is using Deep Learning approaches instead of traditional Machine Learning approaches for the binary classification task, or using metrics specific to LLM-generated tasks.",1,Language Models

Entity recognition identifies key information within the query, such as brand names, product attributes, and numerical values, which can be used to refine the search results AUTHOR. Intent detection focuses on understanding the user's underlying goal, such as product discovery, comparison, or purchase AUTHOR. One of the primary challenges in query understanding is the inherent ambiguity and diversity of user queries. E-commerce queries are often short, lacking context, and can have multiple interpretations AUTHOR. Moreover, the large-scale product catalogs in e-commerce platforms, spanning thousands of categories and millions of products, pose a significant challenge in accurately mapping queries to relevant categories and products. Various approaches have been proposed to address these challenges, leveraging traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning models. Rule-based systems and keyword matching have been widely used for query classification and entity recognition AUTHOR. However, these approaches often struggle with the variability and complexity of natural language queries. Different query intents require different algorithms to yield optimum results AUTHOR. Queries can be classified into navigational (e.g., product category, brand, title) and informational (e.g., product-related questions). While navigational queries require exact matching to catalog products, informational queries necessitate applying more complex understanding techniques. Another critical aspect of query understanding in e-commerce is efficiently processing high-volume traffic. E-commerce platforms receive millions of queries daily, requiring scalable and real-time query understanding systems. Distributed computing frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Ray, have been employed to parallelize query processing and handle the massive scale of e-commerce data AUTHOR. In this paper, we propose an ensemble approach for query understanding in e-commerce, combining deep learning models and traditional techniques. Our approach leverages the strengths of both deep learning, such as DistilBERT AUTHOR, and traditional models, including logistic regression and rule-based systems. By integrating these diverse models, we aim to capture the nuances of user queries and provide robust performance across various query types and categories. We introduce an optimized graph-based architecture based on the Ray framework AUTHOR, enabling efficient processing of high-volume traffic and ensuring scalability.

An optimized graph-based architecture using the Ray framework enabled efficient, scalable processing of high-volume traffic. While the ensemble performed well, there are limitations to address in future work. The system focused only on navigational queries for product categorization and entity extraction. Extending it to handle informational and other query types could further improve relevance. Exploring more advanced data augmentation, model compression, and hardware acceleration techniques could enhance accuracy and efficiency. The query understanding ensemble demonstrated the value of combining diverse models and leveraging distributed computing frameworks for scalability in e-commerce search engines. E-commerce platforms can benefit from adopting similar, ensemble-based approaches customized to their query traffic and product data. The architecture enables efficient real-time query processing while meeting strict latency requirements, critical for delivering a seamless shopping experience.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in most NLP tasks and beyond. However, fine-tuning LLMs can be challenging. In-Context Learning (ICL) has been suggested as a bridging paradigm between training-free and fine-tuning settings for LLMs. In ICL, an LLM is conditioned to solve tasks using a few solved demonstration examples included in its prompt. We focuse on AM in the biomedical AbstRCT dataset. We address ATC using quantized and unquantized LLaMA-3 models through zero-shot learning, in-context learning, and fine-tuning approaches. We introduce a novel ICL strategy that combines kNN-based example selection with majority vote ensembling, along with a well-designed fine-tuning strategy for ATC. In zero-shot setting, we show that LLaMA-3 fails to achieve acceptable classification results, suggesting the need for additional training modalities. However, in our ICL training-free setting, LLaMA-3 can leverage relevant information from only a few demonstration examples to achieve very competitive results. Finally, in our fine-tuning setting, LLaMA-3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on ATC task in AbstRCT dataset.","Argument Mining (AM) focuses on extracting the underlying argumentative and discursive structure from raw text AUTHOR. Argument Type Classification (ATC), which involves classifying argumentative units in text according to their argumentative roles, is the crucial sub-task in AM. Research has shown that the argumentative role of a unit cannot be inferred solely for its text: additional structural and contextual information is needed AUTHOR. This additional information can be incorporated via feature engineering AUTHOR, memory-enabled neural architectures AUTHOR or LLM-based hybrid methods AUTHOR. Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in deep learning and have shown impressive capabilities in most NLP tasks AUTHOR. %Pre-trained in unsupervised fashion on increasingly massive data corpus to learn general language modalities, LLMs have been used for various downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification, text summarization and sentiment analysis. In the main, LLMs are used in two distinct settings: (i) training-free, where the pre-trained LLM is used for inference without any parameter adjustment, and (ii) fine-tuning, where the parameters of the LLM are updated through supervised training to enable transfer learning on a downstream task. Zero-shot learning refers to the training-free approach where a pre-trained LLM is prompted to solve tasks on completely unseen data samples. Recently, In-Context Learning (ICL) has been proposed as a bridging pa\-ra\-digm between the training-free and fine-tuning settings. ICL is a prompt engineering technique whereby an LLM is conditioned to solve tasks by means of a few solved demonstration examples included as part of its input prompt AUTHOR. Generally, the input prompt includes task instructions, the current input sample to be solved as well as several solved input-output pair examples. In this way, ICL maintains the training-free posture (parameters frozen) of the LLM while at the same time providing it with some supervision through demonstration examples. It also enables direct incorporation of selected features inside the prompt template, thereby obviating the need for architecture customization. Creative ICL strategies combining kNN-based examples selection, generated chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and majority vote ensembling have been proposed and shown to outperform fine-tuning approaches AUTHOR. In the main, kNN-based examples selection optimizes the process of learning from few examples and ensembling increases the robustness of the predictions AUTHOR. This work focuses on AM in the biomedical AbstRCT dataset AUTHOR. More specifically, we address the ATC task using quantized and unquantized LLaMA-3 models, among the most capable openly available LLMs (\href{https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard}{cf.~leaderboard}), through zero-shot learning, in-context learning, and fine-tuning approaches. Our contributions are as follows: \item In zero-shot learning setting, we show that LLaMA-3 fails to achieve acceptable classification results, suggesting the need for implementing additional training modalities. \item We introduce a novel ICL strategy that combines kNN-based example selection with majority vote ensembling. In this training-free setting, LLaMA-3 can leverage relevant information from only a few demonstration examples to achieve very competitive results. \item We further experiment with fine-tuning strategy for LLaMA-3. In this setting, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ATC task for AbstRCT dataset. \noindent Our code is freely available on \href{https://github.com/mohammadoumar/BioMedicalAMwithLLaMA3}{GitHub}.","In this work, we address argument type classification (ATC) in the biomedical AbstRTC dataset with openly available LLaMA-3 from the three-fold perspective of zero-shot learning (ZSL), in-context learning (ICL) and fine-tuning (FT). We show that ZSL fails to achieve acceptable performance, ICL significantly improves the results, and FT reaches state-of-the-art performance. These results support the fact that ATC task cannot be solved in a zero-shot setting by relying solely on general-purpose language modalities acquired during pre-training. Additional learning is essential, either in the form of solved demonstration examples (ICL) or via parameters' updates (FT). We conjecture that the sequential flow of arguments within a text is a corpus-specific feature that cannot be inferred through zero-shot methods. Previous works demonstrated that the text of argument components alone do not suffice to infer their argumentative roles AUTHOR. Additional contextual, structural and syntactic features are necessary. In our ICL and FT settings, comprehensive contextual and structural information is incorporated through task-specific information and complete abstract text provided in the prompt. This information enables the model to discern the sequence of arguments, their associated markers, and other characteristics closely associated with their argumentative roles. For future work, the design and implementation of a full AM pipeline using LLMs represents a major milestone. In this scenario, the LLM would take raw texts as input and produce a detailed map of the argumentative structure as output. We believe that LLMs will substantially transform the landscape of AM and its practical applications.

587_2024,2024,18_Paper___Source/main.tex,"Michele Corazza, Leonardo Zilli, Monica Palmirani",Topic Similarity of Heterogeneous Legal Sources Supporting the Legislative Process,ENG,3,1,0,Università di Bologna,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Bologna,"The legislative process starts with a deep analysis of the existing regulations at European and national levels to avoid conflicts and fostering the into force norms. Also the Constitutional Court decisions play a fundamental role in this analysis for checking the compliance with the constitutional framework and for including the inputs coming from this relevant court in the law-making process. Finally, it is also significant to compare the forthcoming proposal with the already presented bills regarding the same topic. This comparison is crucial to avoid overlapping and to coordinate the democratic dialogue with the different parties. In this light, this paper presents an unsupervised approach for calculating similarity between heterogeneous documents annotated in Akoma Ntoso XML, with the aim to support the information retrieval of similar documents using thematic taxonomy used in legal domain. The prototype has been developed for answering to a call for manifestation of interests launched by the Chamber of Deputy of Italy in order to adopt hybrid AI in the legislation process. It uses a completely unsupervised approach based on Sentence Transformers, meaning that neither annotated data or any fine-tuning process is required.","The legislative process inside parliaments and official assemblies includes an initial phase of preliminary discovery of the existing regulations and rules in the same domain of the proposal, in order to synchronize the new bill with the legal system and to avoid conflicting norms. Secondly, a legal preliminary study must be conducted for applying legislative drafting techniques that have the aim of creating transparent and evidence-based legislation (e.g., Better Regulation ). On the other hand, the fragmentation of the legal system imposes the task of an accurate preliminary legal analysis and research at different levels of legislation to the legislative department: at the European level in order to discover the norms in Regulations and Directives; at the national level to avoid overlapping with other existing acts; at the ministerial level to synchronize the technical and operative rules. Notably, it is crucial to check the decisions of the Constitutional Court to avoid to produce norms that are unconstitutional. On the other hand, the legal sources, considering their heterogeneous nature, follow some theory of law principles: i) lex superior derogat inferiori, following a specific hierarchy between the legal sources (e.g., an EU regulation is directly enforceable in the Member States); ii) lex specialis derogat legi generali (e.g., energy regulation overrides general green deal rules); iii) lex posterior derogat legi priori (e.g., the norms should be applied according to the principle of point-in-time with respect to the temporal model of the provisions and facts, the normative references in the preamble are static links fixed in time when the Parliament argues on the justification reasons). Another important check is done with the existing bills already proposed in the assembly to better manage the democratic dialogue between different parties' propositions. For this reason, having a dashboard that, in a unique portal, allows the retrieval, comparison, analysis of different heterogeneous legal sources is a fundamental instrument for this preliminary legal analysis. The documents are annotated in Akoma Ntoso XML AUTHOR for creating a common framework for their representation that is capable of capturing the legal knowledge and metadata (e.g., jurisdiction, hierarchy, temporal model). \par Additionally, we provide an unsupervised approach for classifying legal documents according to their topic, which is used to retrieve the relevant legal documents concerning some main legal topics (e.g., the subject of the Chamber of Deputies Committees defined by law }, or EUROVOC top-level thematic classes) from a user input. This work was conducted on the use-case of the Chamber of Deputy of Italy's needs and documents, answering the call for interests launched in February 2024 concerning the use of AI in Parliament }. \par The legislative language is a peculiar language that includes qualified part of the text like the preamble, normative part, definitions, normative references, exceptions, transitional norms, etc. For this reason, the task is not trivial and should take in consideration these peculiarities.","In this article, we present an unsupervised approach that aims to support the Italian legislative process, by providing useful insights into documents from the relevant European and Italian institutions (European Union, Constitutional Court, Italian Parliament). The system doesn't only provide with a ranking of relevant documents, but it also returns the two most relevant EuroVoc terms (for EU documents) and Chamber commissions (for Italian documents). This allows the user a more thorough exploration of the relevant subjects, while also supplying suggestions in terms of specific documents. \par Our approach is completely unsupervised and it does not rely on any form of annotation, meaning that scaling up the approach to more documents, or even using more performant models do not require any fine-tuning, with the procedure consisting in obtaining the article and title vectors for all documents. Furthermore, the adopted approach leverages the hierarchical nature of legislative documents, as represented in Akoma Ntoso XML in order to produce embeddings that are based on the structure of the document. Moreover, using a structured format as our input allows us to resolve normative references, without which some of the of a document will be impossible to understand for an automatic system. \par The evaluation performed on the classification system showed a promising level of performance for an unsupervised model, which doesn't rely on any information about the specific task. Additionally, the multilingual model used in our method allows users to work both on English and Italian, both in terms of queries and in terms of results, with satisfying results. Nevertheless, it would be possible to improve the quality of the results by testing other models, which might yield better performance. \par The validation of the search by topic task has been assessed by two senior legal researcher in the team, however it is recommendable to organize a session with relevant end-users with some concrete scenarios for returning relevant documents and categories given a user query. For this task, it would be necessary to involve the relevant stakeholders, meaning experts involved in the drafting of legislative documents in Italy. Nevertheless, the project has been evaluated by scientific experts } appointed by the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the context of its manifestation of interest and it was included as part of the work by of one of the two winning consortiums. \par The experimental results obtained in this paper constitute a study of the application of pre-existing Sentence Transformer models in an unsupervised way to the classification and search of Italian legal documents. While we achieved satisfactory results, our approach could still be improved by improving upon the base methodology and conducting a more thorough exploration of other multilingual models. Furthermore, a formal evaluation by the stakeholders would also improve our understanding further specific parameters that arise during the legislative process.

However, much work remains to enhance their interpretability. Annotated datasets with explanations could be key to addressing this issue, as they enable the development of models that provide human-like explanations for their decisions. In this paper, we introduce the SimilEx dataset, the first Italian dataset reporting human judgments of semantic similarity between pairs of sentences. For a subset of these pairs, the annotators also provided explanations in natural language for the scores assigned. The SimilEx dataset is valuable for exploring the variability in similarity perception between sentences and among human explanations of similarity judgments.","Large language models (LLMs) display impressive linguistic skills and demonstrate outstanding performances on a variety of tasks concerning natural language processing and understanding. This is particularly true for the most recent and ground-breaking models such as GPT-3.5\4 [1], LLama-2 [2] and Gemini [3]. LLMs, however, also present risky limitations such as lack of factuality [4, 5], poor interpretability [6, 7] and hallucinations [8]. Consequently, it has become important to verify whether these models are explainable, and specifically whether they can provide human-like explanations using natural language for decisions made [9, 10]. The ability of LLMs to explain the reasoning needed to solve a given task is fundamental, particularly for tasks where there is no established or shared evaluation protocol or benchmark. Annotated datasets with explanations are key to addressing this issue, as they enable the development of models that provide human-like explanations for their decisions. Therefore, multiple datasets have been created with free-form explanations to be incorporated into the model training process and used as benchmarks at test time, mostly focusing on English [10]. Some examples are the e-SNLI dataset [11], a version of the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset [12] enriched with human-annotated explanations, and the Common Sense Explanations (CoS-E) [13] and Semi-Structured Explanations for COPA (COPA-SSE) [14] datasets, which include natural language explanations for commonsense reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing dataset enriched with explanations for Italian is ‘e-RTE-3-it’ [15], an Italian version of the RTE-3 dataset for textual entailment. In this paper, we introduce the SimilEx dataset1 , as far as we are aware, the first Italian dataset of 2,112 pairs of sentences manually annotated for semantic similarity. About half of the pairs are further enriched with free-form human-written explanations that justify the similarity score. The identification of textual similarity is a natural language understanding (NLU) task that involves determining the degree of semantic equivalence between two texts [16, 17]. It is a foundational NLU problem relevant to many applications such as summarisation, question answering and conversational systems [18]. Despite its relevance, this task is highly challenging even for humans due to its subjective nature: human annotations often widely disagree on similarity scores [19] suggesting that the cues driving sentence similarity are neither well codified nor transparent and that their perceived relevance may vary among annotators. Possibly due to these challenges, and as far as we know, datasets including human explanations for the sentence similarity task are lacking. However, they are invaluable as they force annotators to reason about their choices and identify the most relevant traits influencing their annotations.","This paper presented SimilEx, the first Italian dataset on sentence similarity enriched with human judgments and free-form explanations. The analyses of the collected judgments confirmed that the perception of sentence similarity is inherently subjective, as evidenced by the fair agreement between the scores. Notably, annotators tend to agree less on similar sentence pairs, showing greater convergence when sentences are markedly different. The style of the paired sentences appears to influence this convergence: while most linguistic traits may not directly impact the similarity score, some of them affect the homogeneity of judgments assigned by different annotators. These features mostly concern properties of sentence structure rather than raw sentence features such as lenght, which does not play a role in homogeneity. Regarding explanations, we found a correlation between the similarity of the content of the explanations and the similarity scores assigned, indicating that annotators tend to write more similar explanations, using a similar writing style, when their scores align. The findings from this study open several prospects. Expanding SimilEx to include sentences from different textual genera could provide further insights into the factors affecting similarity judgments. Additionally, incorporating more annotators with varying linguistic backgrounds could foster a better understanding of the subjectivity in similarity perception. Lastly, our dataset could help develop automated tools to evaluate the explainability of LLMs. By leveraging SimilEx, researchers can create models that predict similarity scores and generate explanations, enhancing the interpretability of LLMs.",1,Language Models

However, existing large language models (LLMs) and datasets are often insufficiently optimized for Italian, limiting their performance in Italian text retrieval tasks. This paper addresses this gap by proposing both a data collection and specialized models tailored for Italian text retrieval. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze the improvements and limitations in retrieval performance, paving the way for more effective Italian NLP applications.","In recent years, text retrieval systems have emerged as a cornerstone of the natural language processing (NLP) field. These systems are crucial in various applications, including search engines, document indexing, and information retrieval tasks. Their primary function is to fetch relevant pieces of text from large corpora, enabling efficient and accurate information access. This capability is crucial for numerous industries, including legal, medical, and customer service sectors, where timely and precise information retrieval can significantly impact decision-making processes. With the advent of generative AI, the importance of text retrieval systems has only amplified. Advanced systems, particularly chatbots based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AUTHOR, have become essential tools for various purposes. RAG systems combine retrieval mechanisms with generative models to produce contextually relevant and accurate responses in conversational AI applications. This integration has enhanced the capabilities of chatbots, making them more efficient in providing precise information and engaging in meaningful dialogues. Despite the impressive performance of recent large language models (LLMs) as conversational agents in Italian contexts, there remains a notable gap in the resources and models specifically designed for Italian text retrieval tasks.

In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of online misogyny on Twitter through the lens of hurtfulness, qualifying its different manifestation in English tweets considering the profession of the targets of misogynistic attacks. By leveraging manual annotation and a \textsc{BERTweet} model trained for fine-grained misogyny identification, we find that specific types of misogynistic speech are more intensely directed towards particular professions. For example, derailing discourse predominantly targets authors and cultural figures, while dominance-oriented speech and sexual harassment are mainly directed at politicians and athletes. Additionally, we use the HurtLex lexicon and ItEM to assign hurtfulness scores to tweets based on different hate speech categories. Our analysis reveals that these scores align with the profession-based distribution of misogynistic speech, highlighting the targeted nature of such attacks.","%and Background Misogyny is a radical manifestation of sexism directed toward the female gender, which becomes subject of hatred. Its effects are widespread and systematic, bearing severe both social and individual consequences, such verbal and physical violence, rape and femicide. Indeed, misogyny, prejudice, and contempt towards women continue to persist in various forms in our society. While overt acts of discrimination and sexism have received attention, it is crucial to acknowledge that misogyny often manifests in subtle and nuanced ways AUTHOR. Moreover, with the increasing popularity of social media platforms, the dissemination of misogynistic content has become more prevalent and challenging to address AUTHOR. From a socio-historical perspective, women have faced numerous barriers that limited their access to certain professions, hindered their career progression, and subjected them to belittlement and offense related to their work AUTHOR. These gendered biases not only perpetuate inequality but also serve as breeding grounds for misogyny. In this paper, we focus on automated misogyny detection, specifically investigating whether different professional roles trigger varying degrees of hurtfulness across social media posts. By examining the correlation between the profession of offended women and the prevalence of misogynistic attitudes, we aim to shed light on the extent to which misogyny is perpetuated within specific professional domains. ~\citet{fontanella2024we} highlight how research focusing on automatic detection of misogyny tends to show weak connections with other conceptual areas addressing different aspects of the phenomenon. %, such as politics and visual media. The finding suggests that current research has not yet adequately addressed the fine-grained manifestations of online misogynistic attacks. Our contribution conducts novel analyses to uncover and measure misogynistic attitudes within different professional fields. Specifically, we examine how different types of misogyny are distributed across various women's professions and how the language used in misogynistic posts varies across them. To explore this relationship, we expand the % annotated English %language misogyny identification dataset introduced by~\citet{fersini2018overview}, known as AMI, by incorporating the professions of the women targeted. By adding professional categories to AMI, we enable novel analyses on how misogynistic attacks against women differ based on their profession. Our research is driven by the following research questions: \item [RQ1] How does misogyny distribute across professions? We analyze women's profession according to the type of misogyny directed towards them. \item [RQ2] How does the language used in misogynistic tweets vary across different professions? We investigate how specific hurtful expressions are directed at specific professions more frequently than others. To address our RQs, we proceed following the workflow depicted in Figure fig:workflow_drawio. We begin by utilizing a subset of the AMI dataset, which contains ground-truth annotations for misogyny. This subset is manually labeled with the professions of the victims of misogynistic attacks, as detailed in Section~PRF_dataset. %, which includes ground-truth professional categories. We then employ a misogyny classifier to automatically annotate with various types of misogyny a novel collection, the Profession (PRF) dataset, which comprises 760 tweets labeled with professions. The final step involves combining the manually annotated AMI subset with the automatically annotated PRF dataset, resulting in the AMI-PRF dataset. This enriched dataset provides a resource that enables a thorough investigation of the phenomenon. \centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/clic_graph_horizontal.pdf . The PRF dataset, featuring professions by-design, is extracted and automatically annotated with misogyny types using a \textsc{BERTweet} model trained on the AMI dataset.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section sec:relatedwork discusses previous works that closely related to ours, while Section sec:dataset details the enrichment of the AMI dataset with professional categories. Section sec:exp reports the experiments conducted to answer our RQs, whereas Section sec:concl outlines conclusions, limitations, and future directions of the work.","In this paper, we investigated the phenomenon of misogyny on Twitter through the lens of hurtfulness, qualifying its different manifestation considering the profession of the targets of the misogynistic attacks. Specifically, we examined how different types of misogyny are distributed across various professions, unveiling how derailing discourse is mostly used to attack authors, while dominance and sexual harassment speech targets especially politicians. Additionally, we studied through a hurtfulness score measure how the language used in misogynistic tweets varies across different professions: politicians tend to be targeted with hate speech revolving around sexuality (female/male genitalia, homosexuality) and crime, while artists seem to be insulted mainly through general derogatory terms. On the other hand, less heterogeneous results were obtained for athletes and authors, except for peaks in hurtful topics regarding crimes and professions. We acknowledge two potential limitations of our contribution: the incomplete coverage of our dataset's vocabulary by the Hurtlex-based ItEM lexicon, and our decision to focus on just four professions, which, as motivated, was guided by the representation of those professions in the AMI dataset. We therefore plan to extend the approach adopting a richer vocabulary w.r.t. datasets as well as expanding the set of professions. Indeed, as further future investigations, it could be assessed how hurtfulness dimensions change using different lexicons or automatic approaches. We also intend to investigate the distribution of misogynistic language both textual and multi-modal, as well as the broader expression of emotions in posts associated with different professions.

The system consists of a Conversational Recommender System (CoRS), in which the decision-making module is separate from the language generation module. It provides the capability to evolve a belief based on user responses, which in turn influences the decisions made by the conversational agent. The proposed system is based on a pre-existing CoRS that relies on Bayesian Networks informing a separate decision process. The introduction of Influence Diagrams aims to integrate both Bayesian inference and the dialogue move selection phase into a single model, thereby generalising the decision-making process. To test the effectiveness and plausibility of the dialogues generated by the developed CoRS, a dialogue simulator was created and the simulated interactions were evaluated by a pool of human judges.","In recent years, the success of neural networks has generated significant enthusiasm among professionals in the field of artificial intelligence as well as the general public. Various applications, such as speech recognition, computer vision and even interactive conversational models like ChatGPT, have increasingly engaged users, inevitably shaping their perception of AI. This perception can have various implications, even within the scientific community. Attributing human-level intelligence to the tasks currently accomplished by neural networks is questionable, as these tasks barely rise to the level of abilities possessed by many animals AUTHOR. Neural-based approaches to artificial intelligence have been criticised because of the limitations that are intrinsic to purely associative methods. One notable analysis of the problems that come when considering linguistic material generated without a real understanding of the meaning of what is being said is found in AUTHOR, which highlights that, because of the way it is generated, content produced by GPT models adheres to at least one formal definition of bullshit. The fundamental problem with these models is that, while they are trained to capture surface aspects of communication, they are never exposed to the reasons why language is produced. When they output the most probable continuation of the provided prompt, they leave entirely to the human reader the task of interpreting what the produced output might have meant. From a linguistics point of view, within the framework of Austin's speech act theory AUTHOR ``saying something"" equals ``doing something""; the act of producing a sentence (locutive act) is fuelled by an intention (illocutive act) that produces changes in the world (perlocutive act). This classic view of the act of speaking highlights that conversation is a form of intervention in the world: it is put in action to alter in some way the conversational context. This same position is also found in the recent literature about the role of causality in artificial intelligence. Judea Pearl's Ladder of Causation AUTHOR puts intervention capabilities on the second level of the ladder, characterised by the verb doing, as in Austin's seminal work. In this work, machine learning capabilities are limited to the first step of the Ladder, concerned with observational capabilities, leaving interventional ones out. From this perspective, a conversational agent that produces language motivated by the achievement of a goal, thus modelling a raison d'exprimer, is an agent capable of using language with interventional purposes, which can be placed on the second step of the Ladder of Causation. A tool that aims to define conversational agents according to this philosophy is the Framework for Advanced Natural Tools and Applications with Social Interactive Agents (FANTASIA) AUTHOR, an Unreal Engine plugin designed to develop embodied conversational agents. Built upon the functionalities offered by the tool, the FANTASIA Interaction Model follows these main principles: Behaviour Trees (BT) AUTHOR are used to organise and prioritise dialogue moves; Graph Databases (i.e., Neo4j AUTHOR) are used for knowledge representation and dialogue state tracking; Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) are used for decision making; LLMs are used to verbalise the decisions taken by PGMs. The latest results obtained using FANTASIA, presented in AUTHOR, used a decision system based on Bayesian Networks to estimate probability distributions over ratings for users of a movie recommender system. The decision about the dialogue move was taken by a rule-based system taking into account these estimates. In this work, we further develop the approach by generalising the decision process using a single model, an Influence Diagram (ID) AUTHOR. IDs represent an extension of BNs AUTHOR since, in addition to probabilistic nodes, they also contain: \item {Decision nodes, which represent decision points for the agent and which may be multiple within the model. \item {Utility nodes, which represent utility (or cost) factors and which will drive the agent’s decisions, since the objective will be to maximise the utility of the model. Consequently, in addition to the modelling of probabilistic inference problems, the use of IDs also enables the modelling and solving of decision-making problems, in accordance with the criterion of maximum expected utility. In this way, the ID encapsulates both the Bayesian inference and the decision phase in a single, more flexible and elegant model.","The results obtained indicate that the implementation of a knowledge graph exploration strategy based on the ID is more effective than a random strategy. This conclusion is further supported by objective measures, including the system’s entropy, which decreases as the system accumulates information during the dialogue before making a recommendation. It is therefore possible to generalise within an ID a decision-making process that, in the original system, was implemented by a module external to the probabilistic model. The results achieved in this case were lower than the ones of the original system, but this was expected as only part of the original strategy was replicated. Future work will cover the implementation of the missing functionalities and the deployment of the system in the Unreal Engine, as the technology to implement IDs has been integrated in the FANTASIA plugin. We will also investigate the possibility of integrating the argument selection process in the ID to fully support Argumentation Based Dialogue.

Exploring LLMs and Sentence Canonicity in Italian,ENG,4,0,0,"Università di Roma Tor Vergata, Università Ca' Foscari Venezia",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,"Rome, Venice","This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to differentiate between canonical and non-canonical sentences in Italian, employing advanced neural architectures like LLaMA and its adaptations. Canonical sentences adhere to the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure. We hypothesize that recent generative LLMs are influenced heavily by the English language, where non-canonical structures are very rare. Using the in-context learning technique, we probe these models and further fine-tune them for this specific task. Initial results indicate that these models continue to struggle with this task even after fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a test set comprising several hundred sentences from the poetry domain, which presents significant challenges for the canonical structure task.","Unlike contemporary English, which primarily follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure, Italian exhibits a rich variety of non-canonical syntactic structures that deviate from this pattern AUTHOR. Italian is generally considered a configurational language with a neutral or canonical SVO sentence structure. However, it also displays characteristics of a weak non-configurational language due to several typological parameters: free subject inversion, pro-drop, and nonlexical expletives. Additionally, Italian lacks wh- in situ, preposition stranding, deletable complementizers, impersonal passives, and parasitic gaps with the same argument AUTHOR. In cognitive linguistic terms, the use of surface or syntactic constituency and word order in non-canonical sentences in Italian reflects its informational structure. As an example, the first sentence ``Sempre caro mi fu quest'ermo colle e questa siepe che da tanta parte de l'ultimo orizzonte il guardo esclude''''} of Leopardi's famous L'infinito is a typical example of a non-canonical sentence: the complement is fronted and the subject is in post-verbal position, also known as complete argument inversion, for letting the reader focus on the subject and main verb rather than the complement. The functional or relational interpretation of these syntactic structures, along with semantic processing, is essential to understanding the semantic roles associated with displaced grammatical functions. For instance, when a subject appears in an inverted position, it indicates a pragmatically motivated displacement, emphasizing focus over an otherwise topic-related function. Typically, subjects, understood as topics or ``what the sentence is about'' and constituting old information, precede the verb. This is consistent with Italian and English, both of which follow an SVO structure. Conversely, focus, defined as “the essential piece of new information carried by a sentence,” usually follows the verb in the “comment” portion of the sentence. We consider complexity measures sensitive to non-canonical structures (NCS), which are pragmatically motivated and used to encode structured meaning with high informational content, related to the FOCUS/TOPIC non-argument functions in Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) AUTHOR. Non-canonical structures can aid the reader or interlocutor in better understanding the pragmatically relevant meaning in context AUTHOR. Italian NCS are relatively frequent in text. In AUTHOR, the authors analyzed the VIT (Venice Italian Treebank) by manually annotating non-canonical structures and inflected propositions in Italian. The study found that Left Dislocated Complements, where a complement of the main verb according to subcategorization restrictions occurs, appear in 0.03% of cases. Dislocated Subjects, indicating any NP subject not followed by the main verb, occur in 0.28% of cases. The overall percentage of non-projectivity in written texts is 7%, based on 230,629 constituents. Compared to Latin, where the non-projectivity index is 6.65% in the Latin Dependency Treebank containing about 55,000 tokens, Italian and Latin are quite similar. In contrast, English tree projectivity in the Penn Treebank (PT), where the majority of data corresponds to the articles of Wall Street Journal (WSJ), shows much lower numbers: with 720,086 constituents, the non-projectivity index is 0.01004%. Thus, Italian speakers have high expectancies for the presence of an NCS due to processing difficulties also raised by the number of unexpressed subjects: 61% of all Inflected Propositions lack a lexically expressed subject. This does not apply to English speakers, for whom NCS are infrequent and context-specific. In this view, Italian is considered unique for its use of many of the non-canonical structures found in contemporary poetry and examined in this experiment. The richness and freedom of the language give the speakers the ability to produce such a diverse typology of non-canonical structures, which stems from its Latin heritage, with the Null Subject being one of the most well-known features. Like many other languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan, as well as Chinese, Japanese, Slavic languages, Greek, and Hebrew, Italian is a Null Subject Language. However, this parameter alone does not fully explain the richness and complexity of syntactic structures seen in Italian poetry. While other Romance languages share similar syntactic traits, the specific linguistic legacy and poetic traditions of Italian give it a unique character in this regard. In this paper, we want to analyze the ability of recently proposed Large Language Models to detect non-canonical sentences in Italian. Our hypothesis is that, given the very large percentage of English training data (usually more than 90%) and the very low percentage of Italian training data (usually less than 1%), these models have a limited capacity to process such structures and they rely mostly on the English writing structures. On the other hand, the models that have been specifically adapted or fine-tuned on Italian data should show a better understanding of the canonicity in Italian. In the rest, Section sec:rel_work describes the related work, Section sec:method shows the approach in recognizing the canonical structures, Section sec:experiments presents and discusses the results, while Section sec:conclusion derives the conclusions.","In this study, we have shown the potential of Large Language Models, particularly the LLaMA architecture and its Italian adaptations, in distinguishing between canonical and non-canonical sentences in Italian. Our experiments indicate that instruction-tuned models specifically for Italian, such as Camoscio and LLaMAntino, exhibit a strong grasp of Italian syntax and can effectively handle diverse sentence structures. However, the performance for this task is still penalized by the large portion of English data they ingest during pre-training. The findings underscore the importance of tailored language models for specific languages and the benefits of incorporating extensive syntactic variations into training datasets. Future work should focus on expanding the training datasets with more diverse syntactic structures and improving model architectures to better capture the nuances of non-canonical sentences.

594_2024,2024,29_Paper___Source/sample-2col.tex,"Muhammad Saad Amin, Luca Anselma, Alessandro Mazzei",Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Italian NLP: Enhancing Semantic Processing with DRS,ENG,3,0,0,Università di Torino,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Turin,"Discourse Representation Structure (DRS), a formal meaning representation, has shown promising results in semantic parsing and natural language generation tasks for high-resource languages like English. This paper investigates enhancing the application of DRS to low-resource Italian Natural Language Processing (NLP), in both semantic parsing (Text-to-DRS) and natural language generation (DRS-to-Text). To address the scarcity of annotated corpora for Italian DRS, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that involves the use of external linguistic resources including: (i) WordNet for common nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs; (ii) LLM-generated named entities for proper nouns; and (iii) rule-based algorithms for tense augmentation. This approach not only increases the quantity of training data but also introduces linguistic diversity, which is crucial for improving model performance and robustness. Using this augmented dataset, we developed neural semantic parser and generator models that demonstrated enhanced generalization ability compared to models trained on non-augmented data. We evaluated the effect of semantic data augmentation using two state-of-the-art transformer-based neural sequence-to-sequence models, i.e., byT5 and IT5. Our implementation shows promising results for Italian semantic processing. Data augmentation significantly increased the performance of semantic parsing from 76.10 to 90.56 (+14.46%) F1-SMATCH score and generation with 37.79 to 57.48 (+19.69%) BLEU, 30.83 to 40.95 (+10.12%) METEOR, 81.66 to 90.97 (+9.31%) COMET, 54.84 to 70.88 (+16.04%) chrF, and 88.86 to 92.97 (+4.11%) BERT scores. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel augmentation approach in enhancing semantic processing capabilities for low-resource languages like Italian.","The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in semantic processing tasks. These tasks, which include semantic parsing and natural language generation, often rely heavily on parallel corpora --- datasets that align text in one language with its semantic representation or with text in another language AUTHOR. For languages with rich linguistic resources, such as English, the availability of large-scale parallel corpora has facilitated rapid progress in semantic processing AUTHOR. However, for many languages, including Italian, the scarcity of such resources poses a significant challenge to advancing semantic NLP capabilities AUTHOR. Italian presents unique challenges and opportunities. %in the domain of NLP. While Italian shares some structural similarities with English, it possesses distinct linguistic features that complicate NLP tasks. These include a more flexible word order, a rich system of verb conjugations, and the presence of grammatical gender for nouns, adjectives, and articles. In the context of NLP and Natural Language Generation (NLG), Italian has seen moderate progress. However, compared to high-resource languages like English, Italian still lacks extensive task-specific datasets, particularly in areas requiring deep semantic understanding. This deficiency is especially pronounced in tasks involving formal semantic representations such as Discourse Representation Structures (DRS) AUTHOR. While Italian is not typically classified as a low-resource language in general NLP terms, it can be considered as such in the specific domain of semantic processing, especially when dealing with formal semantic representations. This status is characterized by: (i) Named Entities: Italian naming conventions differ from those in English, requiring adaptation in entity recognition tasks; (ii) Syntactic Structure: Although Italian follows the SVO structure like English, it allows for greater flexibility, posing challenges, especially in parsing tasks; (iii) Grammatical Gender: The presence of grammatical gender in Italian adds complexity to tasks such as coreference resolution and agreement in the generated text. These linguistic features, combined with the limited availability of semantically annotated corpora, position Italian as a challenging language for advanced semantic NLP tasks. [ht] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{drs-shapes.pdf Data augmentation (DA), a technique widely used in machine learning to increase the size and diversity of training datasets, has shown promise in addressing resource scarcity in NLP AUTHOR. For semantic tasks involving DRS, DA presents unique challenges due to the need to preserve semantic equivalence while introducing linguistic variety. In the context of Italian semantic processing, traditional augmentation techniques such as random word insertion, deletion, substitutions or back-translation have limited applicability due to the scarcity of Italian-specific semantic resources AUTHOR. This necessitates innovative approaches that can leverage resources from high-resource languages while maintaining the integrity of Italian linguistic structures. Given the challenges outlined, this study aims to develop a novel cross-lingual DA technique for Italian, specifically tailored for DRS-based semantic parsing and generation tasks. {While word substitution techniques are established in DA literature, our approach introduces an innovative cross-lingual framework that leverages the language-neutral nature of DRS. The method uniquely bridges the resource gap between high-resource and low-resource languages by temporarily transforming Italian examples into English, enabling access to rich lexical resources like WordNet, before converting back to Italian. This cross-lingual approach leverages the universal semantic representations of the DRS to enable more advanced data transformation approaches than Italian resources alone would allow, which is particularly advantageous given the limited availability of Italian-specific semantic datasets (see Table~tab:dataset-split for Italian examples). This paper makes the following key contributions: \item A novel cross-lingual augmentation methodology that leverages English WordNet to enhance Italian semantic datasets. \item Empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of this augmentation technique in improving performance scores for both DRS parsing and generation tasks in Italian. \item A detailed analysis of how cross-lingual augmentation affects the handling of Italian-specific linguistic features in semantic processing. \item Insights into the scalability and potential applications of this approach to other low-resource languages in the domain of semantic NLP. The remaining paper is organized as follows: Section~sec:background provides an overview of DRS. %related work in cross-lingual DA and semantic processing for low-resource languages. Section~sec:ita-data-aug details semantic DA for Italian with a focus on named entities, lexical, and grammatical data transformation techniques. Section~sec:experimentation presents our experimental implementation, implications of our results and findings, and their broader impact on the field. Finally, Section~sec:conclusion concludes the paper, addresses certain limitations, and outlines directions for future research. %and Related Work","This study has successfully developed and evaluated a novel cross-lingual DA technique for Italian, specifically tailored for DRS-based semantic parsing and generation tasks. Our research has made significant improvements in addressing the challenges faced by low-resource languages in advanced NLP tasks. The proposed augmentation methodology, leveraging English WordNet to enhance Italian semantic datasets, has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. Empirical evidence shows substantial improvements in performance scores for both DRS parsing and generation tasks in Italian. Notably, our approach achieved a 90.56% SMATCH F1 score for parsing and significant enhancements across all generation metrics (BLEU: 57.48, METEOR: 40.95, COMET: 90.97, chrF: 70.88, BERT-Score: 92.97) on the G+S+C dataset, surpassing both baseline models and previous state-of-the-art results. Our detailed analysis reveals that data augmentation positively affects the handling of Italian-specific linguistic features in semantic processing. The improvements observed across various augmentation strategies indicate enhanced capability in managing syntactic flexibility and grammatical nuances in Italian. This suggests a successful transfer of semantic knowledge through the lens of Italian DRS. \\ \\ \noindent Limitations:\\ Despite our results approach the performance metrics of English---a rich resource language, there remains a gap that future research could address. {For example, the original sentence ``Tom è piuttosto scarso a tennis.'' (``Tom is rather poor at tennis.'') becomes ``Bob era piuttosto ricco con i single.'' (``Bob was sort of rich at singles.'') While this method introduces linguistic diversity, it can result in less coherent sentences in some cases, as seen in this example. Such limitations are common with cross-lingual augmentation strategies through back-and-forth language translations, which focus on lexical variation over syntactic coherence. Future refinement, such as filtering improbable substitutions or adding human validation, could help ensure more consistent logicality in cross-lingual semantic tasks.

In our study, we used phonological syllables as tokens to fine-tune an end-to-end ASR model due to their relevance as linguistic units. Furthermore, this strategy allowed us to keep track of different types of linguistic features characterizing the tokens. The analysis of the transcriptions generated by the model reveals that factors such as token frequency and lexical stress have a variable impact on the prediction strategies adopted by the ASR system.","The syllable is crucial in the process of spoken word recognition. It serves as an integral component within the prosodic system because it encompasses both traditional segmental and suprasegmental levels, facilitating the extraction of lexical and syntactic structures from acoustic information AUTHOR. Specifically, the syllable serves as the linguistic unit where crucial information for speech segmentation, rhythmic patterns, and lexical access is encoded AUTHOR. In the field of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), graphemic segment has traditionally been the primary unit of processing. However, recent studies endorse the use of syllables or phonetic units of similar duration as an alternative strategy AUTHOR. In latest ASR research employing Transformer-based neural models, the role of syllables is investigated both as tokens for word recognition and as components influencing internal speech representations within neural networks AUTHOR. In our study, a neural ASR model was trained to process and recognize phonological syllables, integrating them into word structures. Our goal is to conduct a linguistic analysis on the output of syllabic processing by the speech recognition system. Through fine-tuning a large acoustic model, the study mapped speech signals onto phonological transcriptions segmented into syllables and words. The primary objective of our linguistic analysis is to test the effect of syllable token frequency and lexical stress on the accuracy of output neural representation. To understand how the ASR processes syllables and words differently, we developed a fine-grained linguistic annotation system. This approach was essential to move beyond the limitations of purely numerical metrics like Word-Error-Rate or, in our context, Token-Error-Rate. By employing this system, we could accurately categorize prediction types and link them with specific linguistic aspects of speech. We utilized Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Multinomial Logistic Regression to explore and uncover patterns that relate the neural network's output behavior to the linguistic factors.","This study provides insights into the role of syllables in ASR performance, particularly when integrating phonological information into the recognition process. By fine-tuning a neural ASR model to process and recognize phonological syllables, we were able to conduct a detailed linguistic analysis of its output. Our findings indicate that syllable frequency and lexical stress significantly impact ASR accuracy. Specifically, stressed syllables are more accurately recognized than unstressed ones, especially as frequency increases. Contrary to our expectation, among the low-frequency syllables, stressed tokens are more prone to substitution, whereas mid-frequency unstressed ones are more susceptible to deletion. This demonstrates the neural model's sensitivity to both distributional information in the dataset and phonological information and highlights the model's ability to detect varying syllabic prominence at the lexical level within the signal. As future work, we plan to include other linguistic factors as independent variables to refine our analysis. An interesting approach is to evaluate the impact of unstressed syllables and specific parts of speech by conducting an analysis exclusively on content words. Furthermore, we aim to investigate in detail syllable substitution in relation to token frequency and phonetic similarity to compare the weight of each factor whenever this strategy is adopted to deal with low-frequency tokens. In conclusion, our study showed the influence of token frequency and prominence in ASR predictions while demonstrating that complex computational tools, like modern neural networks, can be effectively utilized by linguists to simulate and test linguistically relevant hypotheses. \clearpage \appendix % Use to avoid numbering",13,Multimodal

Automatic approaches in coherence modeling aim to distinguish coherent from incoherent (often synthetically created) texts or to identify the correct continuation for a given sample of texts, as demonstrated for Italian in the DisCoTex task of EVALITA 2023. While early work on coherence modelling has focused on exploring definitions of the phenomenon, exploring the performance of neural models has dominated the field in recent years. However, coherence modelling can also offer interesting linguistic insights with pedagogical implications. In this article, we target coherence modeling for the Italian language in a strongly domain-specific scenario, i.e. education. We use a corpus of student essays collected to analyse students' text coherence in combination with data perturbation techniques to experiment with the effect of various linguistically informed features of incoherent writing on current coherence modelling strategies used in NLP. Our results show the capabilities of encoder models to capture features of (in)coherence in a domain-specific scenario discerning natural from artificially corrupted texts.","Argumentative essay writing is a fundamental objective in education for both vocational schools and high schools in Italy, as indicated in AUTHOR. It requires students to present arguments supported by personal knowledge or external sources in a coherent and convincing manner. However, writing coherent texts poses both cognitive and linguistic challenges to novice writers and textual competences related to it are frequently claimed to be insufficient, putting pressure on the educational system.\\ Automatically discerning incoherent texts or passages could help teachers to better understand students' problems and give targeted instructions, while students would benefit from more frequent and more timely feedback. However, to date, most NLP research in automatic coherence modelling focused on semantic similarity between two parts of texts using mostly well-formed newspaper or Wikipedia texts, offering little information for educational contexts. \\ In this study, we explore coherence from an educational perspective, utilizing recent language models and data perturbation techniques to probe their value for linguistically informed and informative automatic coherence evaluation for student essays. While large language models have been used successfully in domain general coherence modelling before, we test their effectiveness for text analysis in this domain-specific scenario, taking into account both surface and non-standard language features. We discuss: \item data perturbation techniques to artificially reproduce real-life scenario incoherence in textual data \item a custom probing task design \item automatic evaluation of coherence using different encoding models The results of our experiments show the performances of encoder models in recognizing patterns of (in)coherence in a domain-specific educational context such as upper secondary school student essays.

After a preliminary comparison between pre-trained and fine-tuned models we adopted the best performing one according to our results. The results of the chosen tasks are influenced by the implementation of the perturbation technique, the encoding ability of the model, and the amount and the quality of the data the model is pre-trained on. The best performances are bounded to the model pre-trained with the highest amount of data (GilBERTo). We based our evaluation on simple f1 measures considering this sufficiently indicative of the encoding ability of the model applied to each specific probing task.\\ Since we mainly tested custom perturbation techniques and the encoding abilities of BERT models, future research directions might involve data perturbation techniques enhancement, XAI techiques for model behaviour analysis AUTHOR and the exploitation of state-of-the-art generative one shot and few-shot models in a highly domain-specific scenario such as school essays writing.

Specifically, new guidelines from various governments recommend employing the EuroVoc thesaurus for the classification of documents issued by the PA. In this paper, we explore some methods to perform document classification in the legal domain, in order to mitigate the length limitation for input texts in BERT models. We first collect data from the European Union, already tagged with the aforementioned taxonomy. Then we reorder the sentences included in the text, with the aim of bringing the most informative part of the document in the first part of the text. Results show that the title and the context are both important, although the order of the text may not. Finally, we release on GitHub both the dataset and the source code used for the experiments.","The presence of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques has become almost ubiquitous in many fields, from hobbyist projects to industrial and government usage. Also inside the Italian Public Administration, there have been efforts to digitize and modernize the processes for more than a decade. In particular, some documents released by the Italian PA suggest the use of EuroVoc,} a multilingual thesaurus developed and maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union (EU), that covers a wide range of subjects (law, economics, environment, ...) organized hierarchically. Outside Italy, Portuguese AUTHOR and Croatian AUTHOR communities are making efforts to automatically perform tagging of official regulations using EuroVoc. In addition to that, in 2010 the EU organized in Luxembourg the Eurovoc Conference,} in order to facilitate the comprehension and use of the taxonomy. The classification of a document with respect to the EuroVoc taxonomy has previously been addressed by several studies (see Section~sec:related), since at present the classification of the documentation in the PA is carried out manually, a task that can be very expensive in the long run. In this context, we concentrate our work on automatically assigning EuroVoc labels to a document, starting from the existing approaches in document and text classification, that use pretrained large language models followed by a fine-tuning phase on a specific task. Unfortunately, these families of language models have an intrinsic limit regarding the maximum number of words present in a text (usually 512). In the case of documents that can be quite large, like legal ones, it is important to try and make sure that the key information about a text is included in the chosen set of words. The previous research deals with this limit by concatenating the title with the raw text, and then clipping it to the limit. In some countries (such as Italy, see AUTHOR) the title is usually very well formulated and it is very important to correctly classify a document. On the contrary, the text of a law is usually very redundant, and the most representative text is often after a notable sequence of preambles. Given these premises, we investigate how the previous approaches work on European laws and apply different strategies to create a summarized version of a text by reordering the sentences. The results show that in this specific case, both the title and the context are important, and that the best approach in regulations enacted by the European Parliament is to fill the 512-words limit with as much information as possible. The paper is structured as follows: Section~sec:related will expose the related work; Section~sec:dataset describes the data; the approach and the experiments are described in Section~sec:experiments; the results are then discussed in Section~sec:discussion. Finally, both the software and the dataset are available for download, as described in Section~sec:release.","In this paper, we presented some approaches to perform document classification on long documents, by reordering their sentences before the fine-tuning phase. The best results are obtained when all the 512 tokens allowed in the BERT paradigm are filled, possibly including the title of the law. In the future, we want to extend this approach to other languages, trying to understand whether the same reordering algorithm leads to some improvement in the classification task. We will also investigate other summarization approaches, or new architectures that rely on Local, Sparse, and Global attention AUTHOR so that longer texts (up to 16K tokens) can be used to train the model.",20,In-domain IR and IE

By building a corpus enhanced with coreference/anaphora annotation, the project wants to explore empirically a layer of metalinguistic analysis that has not been yet extensively investigated in linguistic resources and natural language processing for Latin. After reviewing the related work, the paper discusses annotation criteria and data analysis, providing examples about a few issues that emerged during the annotation process.","Over the past decade, research on linguistic resources and natural language processing (NLP) for Latin has seen remarkable growth. As for NLP tools, see the three editions of the evaluation campaign EvaLatin (last edition: ).}. However an important layer of metalinguistic annotation such as coreference and anaphora resolution still remains quite neglected. Indeed, except for the (meta)data produced by the FIR-2013 project Development and Integration of Advanced Linguistic Resources for Latin AUTHOR, there are neither corpora enhanced with coreferential/anaphoric annotations nor NLP tools for automatic coreference/anaphora resolution for Latin. This absence limits the degree of granularity of information extraction from Latin corpora. Such a limitation is particularly compelling, as Latin texts are mainly used for purposes of research in the Humanities, like literary, stylistic and philosophical analysis. To give an example, investigating in Latin texts a philosophical concept conveyed by a word like voluntas `will', or studying the turns of a certain character in a drama would highly benefit from a textual resource where, for instance, the ana-/cataphoric references of pronouns are resolved. The PRIN 2022 project Textual Data and Tools for Coreference Resolution of Latin was granted funding to overcome such situation. Run jointly by the Università Cattolica of Milan and the University of Udine, the project stems from the FIR-2013 pilot experience, having the short-term objective of developing a large-scale and balanced dataset of Latin texts enhanced with coreference/anaphora resolution (called CorefLat). Based upon this annotated dataset, the project has two long-term objectives. The first aims to develop and evaluate a set of trained models for automatic coreference/anaphora resolution of Latin. The second long-term objective wants to publish the metadata pertaining to coreference/anaphora resolution as Linked Data, to make them interoperable with other (meta)data in the Web. To this aim, the texts of the annotated dataset are selected among those published in the LiLa Knowledge Base, a collection of multiple linguistic resources for Latin described with the same knowledge vocabulary and interconnected according to the principles of the Linked Data paradigm AUTHOR}. This paper details the initial stages of the creation of the CorefLat annotated dataset.","In this paper, we provided a overview of a project aimed to build a Latin corpus enhanced with coreference and anaphora resolution. Specifically, we delineated the guidelines employed in the annotation process. We exemplified a few annotation challenges, highlighting how this task necessitates a profound interaction among various fields of expertise, including linguistics, textual criticism, and literature. Moreover, once a sufficiently large dataset will be available, NLP will be concerned, as we plan to use the annotated data to train and evaluate a model to perform automatic CR/AR of Latin. In the long term, a follow-up of the project will have to encompass other types of coreferences, such as appositive, predicative, and descriptive ones. Additionally, given that Latin is a pro-drop language, ellipsis resolution is a natural next step that, together with CR and CR, promises to provide a deep level of granularity in extracting information from Latin texts.",5,Latin Resources

Dinu, Bogdan Iordache, Bianca Guita, Simona Georgescu, Alina Cristea",0,0,Romania,Bucharest,"In this paper we build a dataset of Italian graphical syllables (called ItGraSyll). We perform quantitative and qualitative analyses on the syllabification and stress assignment in Italian. We propose a machine learning model, based on deep-learning techniques, for automatically inferring syllabification and stress assignment. For stress prediction we report 94.45% word-level accuracy, and for syllabification we report 98.41% word-level accuracy and 99.82% hyphen-level accuracy.","Word syllabification and syllable analysis are two related issues of great importance in the study of language (written or spoken). These topics have attracted a large category of researchers, from pure linguists, in phonetics, to psycholinguists, computer scientists, speech therapists, etc. Thus, the syllable plays an important role in language learning and acquisition, speech recognition, speech production AUTHOR, language similarity AUTHOR, in text comprehensibility (Kincaid-Flesch formula AUTHOR), in speech therapy, in poetry analysis AUTHOR, etc. Each language has its own way of grouping sounds into syllables and its own rules for dividing words into syllables. Linguistically, the syllable represents ""the smallest phonetic trance likely to receive an accent and only one"" AUTHOR, and the syllabic cut is seen by \citet{de2011course} on the border between the implosion and the explosion of the spoken sound: ""If in a chain of sounds one goes from implosion to explosion, one obtains a particular effect which is the indication of the boundary of the syllable"". The analysis of the words’ syllabic structure also plays an important part in historical linguistics AUTHOR, not only in diachronic phonetics and phonology, but also in lexicology. Romance comparative linguistics, in particular, still needs a detailed overview of this aspect, as syllable, segmentation and prosody can give strong account on phonetic changes that haven’t been explained yet. The “prosodic revolution” AUTHOR from Latin to the Romance languages – including syncope (the loss of an intermediate syllable) and apocope (the loss of the final syllable) at a large scale – has led to major changes, but their weight is different from one idiom to another: while the Western Romance languages manifest highly evident differences from the Latin phonological and prosodic system, and the Eastern languages are considered to be most conservative from this point of view, Italian seems to be in between AUTHOR. On the other hand, in Latin, the relation between stress and quantity grew stronger, thus short stressed vowels progressively gained length. It is noteworthy that this situation is best preserved in Italian, and not in the Eastern Romance idioms: thus, in Italian stress cannot skip a heavy penultimate syllable, and stress cannot fall further back than the antepenultimate syllable, a twofold characteristic feature of the Latin prosodic system. This is why we are taking Italian as a starting point for a larger-scale study, oriented towards all Romance languages. The main difference between Latin and its modern descendants is that Latin stress was quantity- sensitive, leading thus to the following rule: in polysyllabic words, stress fell on a heavy penultimate (meaning, containing a long vowel), otherwise on the antepenultimate. Due to the collapse of vowel quantity as a distinctive feature in the vocalic system, no Romance language has retained the Latin stress rule as such AUTHOR. As, from a statistic point of view, the greatest part of the Romance lexicon is represented by penultimate stressed words, a basic automatic mechanism would assign penultimate stress by default, whereas for both final and antepenultimate stress, the machine (as well as, not in a few cases, non-native speakers) would need further specification. As a consequence of the loss of Latin vowel quantity, Romance stress has ceased to be completely predictable. That is, partially, why in the majority of the traditional Romance comparative or historical grammars, there is no specific section devoted to syllabification AUTHOR, or, if there is, it focuses either on general prosodic features AUTHOR, or on the vowel evolution depending on its presence in an open or closed syllable AUTHOR. The lack of a section dedicated to syllabification is also common in the historical grammars of Italian AUTHOR. We will focus in this research only on written form of words, so we will investigate only the graphical syllabification and stress. By focusing on the graphical syllabification and stress in Italian, we aim to take a step forward towards the complete evaluation of the prosodic changes that took place in the transition from Latin to the Romance languages, and their influence on the Romance phonetics and phonology. A machine- learning model, capable of automatically inferring graphical syllabification and stress assignment, along with the purpose of creating a data-base containing the quantitative and qualitative description of syllabification and stress in the Romance languages, could be the first important task in the greater challenge of tracing the similarities and differences between the Romance languages and, more important, between Romance and Latin. From a typological point of view, the study of syllabification and stress can shed a new light on the universal features that, by defining our phonoarticulatory and phonoacoustic apparatus, have guided the languages’ development and change. Given the promising results of this analysis, the present study can establish the basis of a research of the syllable in other languages, either linguistically or typologically related to Italian. One of the studies that address automatic syllabification in Italian belongs to \citet{bigi2014generic}, who proposed a tool that performs rule-based automatic segmentation. \citet{adsett_et_all} and \citet{DBLP:journals/csl/AdsettMK09} investigated whether data-driven approaches outperform rule-based approaches for a language with a low syllabic complexity, such as Italian. The authors reached the conclusion that even in this case data-driven systems are the more appropriate approach. In terms of machine learning, the tasks of automatically inferring syllable boundaries and predicting stress assignment can be naturally framed as sequence labeling problems. While automatic syllabification has received more attention recently AUTHOR, stress placement has not been investigated as much AUTHOR. Given the complexity of syllable applications and word syllabification, the presence of electronic resources dedicated to them becomes a necessity. While native speakers of a language generally do not have great difficulty in spelling words, the same cannot be said of those who learn a foreign language who often tend to apply their own rules to foreign words, and problems arise in automatic syllabification. This is because the rules of syllabification are linguistic rules, and they cannot always be easily modeled by the computer when there are no other linguistic factors that those rules take into account. For example, a rule that is present in many languages distinguishes between a vowel and a semivowel, but the computer is not able to easily recognize when the same sign has the value of a vowel and when it is a semivowel. Because of this, rule-based adaptations of syllabification systems AUTHOR generally have higher errors, and many languages do not have an automatic syllabification system yet (for example, in the Python library, only a few languages have syllabification). The last few decades have brought the first data-driven syllabification systems. However, in order to build such a system, training data is needed, and there are many cases in which the available data do not cover the whole language, and thus the systems have different results when the test corpus is changed. Starting with these remarks, our main contributions are: \item We propose ItGraSyll (Italian graphical syllables), a dataset of 114,503 Italian words, in orthographic form, containing annotations for their orthographic syllabification and stress placement \item We perform quantitative and qualitative analyses of the previously built dataset. \item We analyze stress placement in the context of the Italian syllables. \item We propose an automatic system of syllabification for Italian words.","In this paper we have investigated graphical syllabification and graphical stress assignment for Italian words. We have started by building ItGraSyll, a dataset of Italian graphical syllabified words, with stress annotations as well, on which we have performed several quantitative and qualitative analyses, including the verification of two minimum effort laws for the case of Italian. Finally, we have proposed a recurrent neural network machine learning model for automatic syllabification and stress assignment for Italian written words. For stress prediction we have obtained 94.45% word-level accuracy, and for syllabification we have obtained 98.41% word-level accuracy and 99.82% hyphen-level accuracy.

In spite of their importance, no lemmatized version existed and the two collections were not part of the major annotated corpora linked to LiLa. The paper discusses the workflow used to annotate and publish the works as Linked Open Data connected to the LiLa Knowledge Base. On account of their subject and the emotional tone attached to the theme of exile, the two works are particularly relevant for sentiment analysis. We discuss some results of a lexicon-based analysis that is enabled by the interlinking with LiLa. We use LatinAffectus, a manually-generated polarity lexicon for Latin nouns and adjectives, to perform Sentiment Analysis on the aforementioned works and interpret the (replicable) results by consulting and simultaneously enriching the available literary scholarship with new information. % AURORA % In this paper, we first demonstrate the necessity of interoperability, open access and continuous updating of linguistic resources produced for Latin. Specifically, we describe the process of publishing the morphologically annotated text of the Tristia and the Epistulae ex Ponto, two works written by Ovid during his exile on the shores of the Black Sea, in the LiLa Knowledge Base which follows the principles of the Linked Data paradigm and uses widely adopted ontologies to model the relevant information. Secondly, we show the potential of the hybrid approach promoted in the field of Computational Literary Studies, which allows addressing questions posed in literary criticism by using investigative tools developed in the field of computational linguistics. Specifically,","The World Wide Web provides Latin scholars with a plethora of free, high-quality resources, issued from a long tradition of linguistic and philological study; many digital libraries, such as the Perseus Digital Library AUTHOR or the Digital Latin Library AUTHOR, supply electronic and often machine-actionable versions of some of the most studied texts in world literature. In the last years, the CIRCSE Research Center has developed the LiLa Knowledge Base with the objective of making the distributed knowledge about Latin texts interoperable through the application of the principles of the Linked Data paradigm AUTHOR. LiLa (presented below in sec. sec:lila) now includes a number of lexicons and annotated corpora. In particular, the Opera Latina LASLA corpus, a manually lemmatized and morphosyntactically annotated corpus of more than 1.5 million words mainly belonging to Classical Latin literature that was recently added to LiLa AUTHOR, has significantly expanded the textual heritage within the LiLa Knowledge Base, which now provides a Linked Open Data (LOD) compliant edition of many widely studied literary works. %, such as the Word Formation Latin (WFL) derivational lexicon AUTHOR and a few syntactically annotated corpora, including the Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB) AUTHOR and the UDante Treebank AUTHOR. Furthermore, linking and included most of the works by Ovid, the author examined in this study. However, a significant portion of the author's production, namely the two works written during his relegatio in Tomis, modern Constantza, on the Romanian coast of the Black Sea, the Tristia and the Epistulae ex Ponto, was still unjustly missing. In its first part (section), this paper describes the Ovidian works already present in LiLa (subsection) and explains the process of annotating and publishing the digital editions of the aforementioned works in LiLa (subsection). Publius Ovidius Naso (anglicized as Ovid, 43 BCE - 17 CE) is arguably one of the most influential writers in the history of Western literature. His mythological poem in 15 books (the Metamorphoses, written between 2 and 8 CE) has been a crucial source of inspiration for artists like Dante, Shakespeare, or Titian. His body of elegiac poetry of erotic subject won him immense popularity during his life and afterwards. In spite of his importance, the work of Ovid is not represented in full neither in the LiLa network, nor in any other annotated corpora. The LASLA corpus provides only his earlier works (Ars Amatoria, Remedia Amoris, Medicamina, Amores, Heroids) and other poems (Fasti, Halieutica, Ibis), while the annotation of the Metamorphoses is listed as ``in progress''. Among the works that are utterly missing figure two of the last books of Ovid's career, the Tristia (``Sorrows'' or ``Lamentations'', written between 9--13 CE) and the Epistulae ex Ponto (``Letters from the Black Sea'', 12--17 CE, henceforth Epistulae) that were partly published after the poet's death. These two poetic collections center around Ovid's forced departure from Rome and exile to the town of Tomis (modern-day Constanța in Romania), at the furthest ends of the Roman empire. Despite his many attempts, Ovid would never come back from this ``utmost part of an unknown world'' (extremis ignoti partibus orbis, Tr. 3.3.3. ) nor was he ever restored to his previous status. % Although they do not clarify the reasons for the banishment imposed by the late emperor August himself, The two works are a fundamental source for the biography of the poet. Moreover, they are a foundational archetype of a peculiar sub-genre that is still influential in modern days, the ``exile literature'' AUTHOR. Ovid's exilic works were banished from libraries, and although they survived, were often judged unfavorably by the critics \cite[xxxvi]{green_2005}. The present study aims, in part, at revoking the ban that still seems to weigh on these Ovidian poetic collections, allowing them to enter the LiLa network. In what follows we describe how we prepared a lemmatized and part-of-speech (POS) tagged version of the two poems and how we linked this edition to the network of textual and lexical resources for Latin connected to LiLa. Our work fills the significant gap created by the absence of the exilic works of Ovid from the available annotated corpora. In addition, it also links to LiLa two collections of poems that, on account of their subject, foreground the emotional tone, and were successful in shaping the conventions of exilic literature; these works established the literary codification of the psychological reactions to banishment, within a veritable poetics of exile. Their content and historical relevance make them ideal candidates for a computationally based study on the sentiment analysis of literary texts.%, an application of Sentiment Analysis that is gaining more and more attention. The paper is structured as follows. Section sec:work reviews related work, with a specific focus on sentiment analysis within the field of Computational Literary Studies. Section sec:lila introduces the LiLa Knowledge Base and the language resources connected to it. Section sec:methodology describes the workflow followed for the annotation, publication and linking of the works. Section sec:sentiment discusses the type of knowledge that can be gained by combining the data from LatinAffectus, a prior polarity lexicon of Latin included in LiLa, and the newly prepared edition of the works, for a lexicon-based approach to their sentiment. Section sec:conclusion presents the conclusions and discusses plans for future work.","The work that we presented in the paper had two outcomes. Firstly, our LOD edition of Ovid demonstrates the benefits of interoperability among resources for Latin. Interoperability greatly facilitates the work of scholars, allowing them to benefit from lexicon, corpora, and NLP tools useful for every stage of their research through a single point of access. The LiLa project already provides a paradigm of this model, but to continue doing so, it requires constant integration. This is true not only for corpora, whose enrichment this paper testifies to. Despite the important results that SA conducted with LatinAffectus already provides for Ovid, there remains several ways for enhancing its performance. The coverage of LatinAffectus is extensive with regard to nouns and adjectives, as clearly demonstrated by its performance on the dataset discussed in this paper (see table tab:coverage). However, it is evident that a current limitation is its failure to account for the sentiment of verbs. This is why LatinAffectus, like the other linguistic resources available in LiLa, should not be regarded as a static resource, but rather as one that is continually evolving and being updated. Additionally, improvements could be made by accounting for syntactic phenomena such as polarity shifters AUTHOR and by taking into consideration the poetic nature of the text (e.g. by providing access to metrical information). In a broader sense, there is a lack of sufficient consideration for the context in which sentiment words are collocated. However, context-sensitive sentiment analysis is still in its early stages within NLP paper for an overview of state-of-the-art studies on context-sensitive sentiment analysis.}, and clearly, much work remains to be done to effectively incorporate context into sentiment analysis. The second outcome is in suggesting the undeniable potential of a hybrid approach, such as the one employed in this study, crossing literary criticism with the use of quantitative methods and computational resources. The theories developed within literary criticism and the investigative tools provided by computational linguistics can and should effectively collaborate, mutually enriching each other. In this specific context, the reflections developed within literary criticism regarding Ovid's exile works were crucial for interpreting the data derived from sentiment analysis. In turn, sentiment analysis was fundamental for confirming and deepening these observation, providing interpretable and reproducible data. If a classic is a book which has never exhausted all it has to say to its readers (as Calvino wrote \cite[5]{calvino_why_2009}), it is also because scholars are capable of interrogating it with new methods to address longstanding and unresolved questions.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Unlike other CC-focused resources that often contain shorter documents, the NYTAC-CC subcorpus offers a diverse array of articles with varying lengths and complex content, making it a unique resource for investigating the evolution of CC narratives over time. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (i) We present the NYTAC-CC subcorpus %(by publishing the filenames) and its construction using blending of dictionary-based and supervised methods in order to ensure representativeness as well as validity and reliability, which are key in social science research AUTHOR.

Previous work was usually restricted to retrieving articles via a small set of keywords or bigrams; we propose here a more elaborate method that can contribute to the important goal of representativeness of data sets used in social science research (besides validity and reliability; cf., for example, AUTHOR). (ii) To demonstrate the validity of the subcorpus, and thus its reliability for further downstream tasks, we illustrate the results of a classification experiment using ClimateBERT AUTHOR. %a BERT-based model specifically trained on CC-related texts, While this experiment further validates that the articles in our NYTAC-CC subcorpus are, indeed, true positives, it also shows limitations of ClimateBERT. As ClimateBERT falsely classifies a number of true positives from our subcorpus as (false) negatives, we demonstrate that our approach achieves better results in ensuring recall of relevant CC articles from the NYTAC corpus. (iii) To gain initial insights into the CC subcorpus coverage, we use keyword analysis and topic modeling (specifically LDA) to track specifics of CC reporting over the 1987-2007 time span. The results show important trends over time, including key periods of reporting and a large variety of contexts in which CC is discussed. %Given this data source (subcorpus), we apply topic modeling (in particular LDA) to track the development of climate change reporting, specifically the coverage of subtopics, in the NYT for the time span 1987-2007.

Addressing the lack of available news-based textual resources for NLP tasks, we employed a hybrid method combining keyword-based prefiltering and automatic classification to optimize the corpus construction. The representativeness of the subcorpus was confirmed using ClimateBERT, but additional manual inspection of ClimateBERT's classification of a relevant amount of true positives as (false) negatives also showed the model's limitations and the benefits of the hybrid approach chosen. Initial analyses of the subcorpus, including statistics, keyword searches, and topic modeling, highlight the corpus's potential for detailed diachronic and subtopic exploration. Thus, the NYTAC-CC subcorpus can be a useful resource for examining the historical narrative of climate change in news media. As it builds on the NYTAC corpus, it adds to previous work on this data, providing valuable insights for social science research. It also serves as a beneficial dataset for developing NLP applications that require a deep understanding of climate-related discourse. While the size of the subcorpus may restrict certain quantitative analyses, its rich, concentrated content is ideal for qualitative studies. Furthermore, it offers the potential for expansion and further integration with additional sources to enhance its utility and relevance for ongoing climate change research.

Initial explorations, including basic statistics, keyword analysis, and topic modeling, have already highlighted the potential for nuanced diachronic analysis and more fine-grained subtopic exploration. As future work, we plan to extend these preliminary findings by employing advanced topic modeling techniques, such as structured topic modeling that systematically incorporates time and dynamic topic modeling. %These efforts aim to further enrich our understanding of the evolving narratives on climate change. Newspaper text documents and corpora can be complex in terms of their ""inner logic"" and metadata assignment. We worked with the NYTAC, which contains certain types of documents that involve a set of potentially very different news items (making content analysis more difficult) as well as noise in the manually-assigned topic terms. Building a reliable topic-specific subcorpus is therefore not trivial, and we experimented with different methods before settling on our ""climate change"" subcorpus. Our procedure contrasts with the typical of approach of previous research, which either uses just a small number of query terms (often only only the CC bigram) or involves manual confirmation. The former has problems for both precision and recall, and the latter is feasible only when the overall corpus is reasonably small (as in the case of AUTHOR. We see our method of keyword-based pre-filtering and subsequent supervised classification as a compromise between quality and efficiency requirements, suitable for relatively large document collections. We showed basic statistics on the patterns of climate change coverage in the NYT over a 20 year period, and then extended this by running topic modeling (LDA) on the texts when reduced to just their nominal terms. The resulting set of 18 topics seems to us to reflect the subtopic ""landscape"" of climate change quite well, and the topic-document assignment can now be used for more specific content analyses. The IDs of the texts that we identified as the NYTAC CC subcorpus will be made available for research by other licensees of the corpus. For our own future work, we plan to do further experiments with topic modeling, including more recent algorithms than LDA, such as structured topic modeling (where the time can modeled systematically) and dynamic topic modeling. Future Work: \item apply Classification Experiments on the whole corpus (?) \item perform both qualitative and quantitative dyachronic analysis on the NYTAC-CC over time both in terms of language use and of more fine-grained analysis on subtopics overtime",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Bianchini,0,0,"Italy, France","Bologna, Poitiers","The paper presents a pilot exploration of the construction, management and analysis of a multimodal corpus. Through a three-layer annotation that provides orthographic, prosodic, and gestural transcriptions, the Gest-IT resource allows to investigate the variation of gesture-making patterns in conversations between sighted people and people with visual impairment. After discussing the transcription methods and technical procedures employed in our study, we propose a unified CoNLL-U corpus and indicate our future steps.","Corpora represent the main tool for linguists to observe language in its real use and verify its general trends on both a quantitative and qualitative basis AUTHOR. Today, written language corpora are the most used, thanks to the greater availability of written data and the ease of processing. However, in speech, speakers appeal to numerous semiotic sources (e.g., spoken channel, gestures, proxemics, facial expressions, etc.) to create and convey meaning, and written corpora fail to account for this richness of modalities. To effectively study how language works, one should observe these different semiotic sources independently of each other and take their interactions into account AUTHOR. To capture this complexity, it is necessary to go beyond written data and use multimodal corpora, namely collections of audio-visual linguistic data that allow to both hear and see linguistic productions. Multimodal corpora can be used to analyze a wide variety of linguistic phenomena, especially those related to the use of body in human communication and interaction, and to the way bodily communication and spoken language interact to generate meaning. They are, therefore, the primary sources for the analysis of co-speech gestures AUTHOR and Sign Languages. Following AUTHOR, we define a multimodal corpus as `an annotated collection of coordinated content on communication channels including speech, gaze, hand gesture and body language'. Multimodal corpora come in various shapes, depending on the nature of the communication channel captured by the resource. For the sake of this article, we specifically restrict our attention to resources including both a video and audio recording of linguistic content). For a collection of available multimodal resources see \url{https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families/ multimodal-corpora} (spoken language) and (sign language), while a list of audio-only resources of spoken language can be found at }. The long tradition of analyzing written and spoken data has, over time, led to the development of transcription systems (such as \textsc{IPA}, orthography, and various prosodic conventions), which have become recognized standards within the linguists' community. These systems allow for an ``objective'' description of speech, independently of any considerations on the functions or the meanings of the described elements. For gestural data, some transcription systems have also been proposed, such as the Linguistic Annotation System for Gestures (LASG; AUTHOR), but none of them has attained enough acceptance to qualify as a standard AUTHOR. In the absence of an effective transcription system, hybrid solutions are often employed, situated between transcription and annotation, where the choices for describing gestural forms reflect their attributed functions (e.g.: a ``shrug'' is a shoulder movement, but this label is often used to refer to any pragmatic gesture of epistemic denial performed by moving the shoulders, without specifying either the characteristics of the shoulder movement or the movements of other body parts that may have contributed to the execution of the gesture). Similar challenges arise in studies on Sign Languages. Although there is a larger number of transcription systems for the latter (see, for instance, the review in AUTHOR), none of them has achieved the status of a universal standard. Additionally, attempts to adapt these systems to the transcription of gestures have so far been limited and not particularly successful. The lack of a transcription standard for gestures, that describes them independently of their function or meaning, hinders the ability to precisely investigate the relationship between speech and gesture. Another aspect concerns the nature of language data captured in multimodal resources: as the collection and standardization process for this kind of linguistic data is, by its very nature, much more complex, resources are often tailored to specific purposes and therefore involve task-oriented interactions (e.g., describing objects as in the NM-MoCap-Corpus AUTHOR; spatial comunication tasks as in the SaGA Corpus AUTHOR), thus capturing interactions that may be naturalistic but are inherently non-ecological, i.e. not naturally-occurring AUTHOR. Often, participants are asked to wear special devices such as headsets or trackers during the recordings AUTHOR, clearly altering the spontaneity of the interaction. The aim of the Gest-IT project is to build a multimodal corpus of ecological data, allowing for the integrated analysis of verbal and gestural communication in spontaneous interactions. In this paper, we will focus on the protocol of multimodal data management that we tested for this resource. We will first discuss the main existing multimodal resources (Section~sec:related), showing how, as of today, there doesn't seem to be any ecological, accessible, multimodal corpus for Italian. We will then introduce the Gest-IT pilot resource and present its main features with respect to existing resources (Section~sec:gestit). Section~sec:schema outlines the main design choices taken for the creation of our resource and Section~sec:future describes the path ahead.","The aim of this paper is to share with the scientific community the protocol developed to build a multimodal resource for the Italian language in terms of data collection (design, ethic issues, practicalities); data management and curation; data transcription, annotation and analysis. In doing so, we contribute to the debate on multimodal resource building, which is still lacking an established standard. In particular, our contribution in this respect is twofold. Firstly, our study suggests to adopt a three-layer transcription where the three layers (i.e., the orthographic transcription, the prosodic/interactional transcription, and the gestural transcription) align to each other, by using ELAN as a tool for transcribing and CoNLL-X as an interoperable output format. This has the advantage of grounding gestures as an integrated semiotic source within verbal conversation and ultimately allows to unveil gesture-speech regularities. Secondly, we propose an innovative approach for the annotation of gesture data. By relying on common practices in the field of sign languages, we suggest that gesture transcription should follow the same rationale of phonetic transcription, with a method that describes `objective' aspects that characterize the `form' of the gesture, thus allowing for an interpretation-independent annotation. Clearly, the project is still at a very preliminary stage. Next steps will include the complete orthographic, prosodic and gesture transcription of the recordings; a thorough revision and pseudoanymization.",13,Multimodal

This creates the need for automated systems, in order to classify text and extract information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, a significant challenge lies in the limited availability of pre-trained models for less common languages, such as Italian, and for specific medical domains. Our study aims to develop an NLP approach to extract Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) information from Italian EHRs at Gemelli Hospital in Rome. We then introduce Lupus Alberto, a fine-tuned version of AlBERTo, trained for classifying categories derived from three distinct domains: Diagnosis, Therapy and Symptom. We evaluated Lupus Alberto's performance by comparing it with other baseline approaches, selecting from available BERT-based models for the Italian language and fine-tuning them for the same tasks. Evaluation results show that Lupus Alberto achieves overall F-Scores equal to 79%, 87%, and 76% for the Diagnosis, Therapy, and Symptom domains, respectively. Furthermore, our approach outperformed other baseline models in the Diagnosis and Symptom domains, demonstrating superior performance in identifying and categorizing relevant SLE information, thereby improving clinical decision-making and patient management.","Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used in many applications, such as in the medical domain, where the huge amount of unstructured data sources coming from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) generates the need to develop automated systems for text classification and information extraction. However, employing such methods is challenging due to the scarcity of pre-trained models in less common languages like Italian, and for specific medical domains. In this study, we explored the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), a complex pathology which involves different organ domains and can occur in patients at several levels of severity. For this reason, information about diagnoses, symptoms and therapies are used by physicians to characterize Lupus patients and to make better informed decisions about therapy changes or time for the next contact visit. However, these Lupic features are not always available in a structured format, then there is the need for NLP approaches in order to interpret clinical reports and extract the desired data. Based on the literature, large language models (LLMs) and transformer-based architectures represent the state-of-the-art for EHR classification tasks AUTHOR.

604_2024,2024,45_paper,Fabio Tamburini,Complexifying BERT using LoRA Adapters,ENG,1,0,0,Università di Bologna,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Bologna,"This paper presents the first results of a pilot study for transforming a real-valued pre-trained transformer encoder into a complex-valued one. Following recent findings about pre-training using LoRA, the main idea is to employ complex-valued LoRA adapters to make the trick and continue the pre-training of a given Italian model for setting up the adapters. After pre-training, the proposed complex-valued model has been evaluated on a standardised benchmark for Italian natural-language understanding obtaining very encouraging results.","The works from Arjovsky et al. [1], Trouillon et al. [2] and Trabelsi et al. [3] proposing complex-valued Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) rose an increasing interest on this type on Neural Networks for their intrinsic ability to manage problems defined on complex-valued features. For example, in the fields of signal and image processing, speech, signal and audio data are naturally complex-valued after Fourier, Laplace or Complex Wavelet transforms. Yang et al. [4] and Eilers and Jiang [5] presented state-of-the-art Automatic Music Transcription systems and Wang et al. [6] evaluated their complex-valued embeddings in text classification, machine translation and language modeling with promising results. Quantum-inspired Machine Learning, an emerging topic of research in NLP and AI, is completely based on complex-valued features and tensors. Liu et al. [7] presented a survey of novel quantum-cognitively inspired models that solved the task of sentiment analysis with good performances and Tamburini [8] proposed a Quantum WSD system based on static complex-valued embeddings obtained modifying the ‘word2vec’ [9] code. The transformer encoder is a crucial component in transformer architectures [10]: primarily designed for processing input text and producing intermediate representations of input sequences, it consists of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks, each contributing to the encoding process of both single words and entire sequences.LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) [11] is a technique recently introduced to efficiently fine-tune transformer models. Instead of updating all the parameters of a large pre-trained model, LoRA introduces a small set of additional trainable parameters. These parameters are incorporated into the transformer layers through low-rank matrices, allowing the model to adapt to new tasks with significantly reduced computational and storage requirements. This method preserves the original model’s performance while enabling quick and cost-effective customisation for specific applications. A very recent work [12] suggested that, by applying LoRA adapters, it is possible to pre-train large transformer models from scratch obtaining comparable performance with respect to regular pre-training. The main idea and contribution of this work consists in using LoRA adapters to convert a real-valued pre-trained transformer model into a complex-valued one being able to produce as output complex-valued word and sequence embeddings to be used in subsequent tasks. This process will require to continue the pre-training stage of a realvalued transformer model for setting up complex-valued LoRA adapters and train the global model to produce meaningful complex-valued embeddings. Section 2 describes the state-of-the-art about complex-valued transformers; Section 3 presents the proposed model describing the internal details of our complex-valued LoRA-based transformer. Section 4 illustrates the obtained results when testing our complex-valued model on a benchmark for evaluating Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems for the Italian Language [13] and Section 5 discusses the results and draws some conclusions.","In our evaluation experiments we adopted the hyperparameters proposed in Basile et al. [13] for maintaining comparability, but our models are bigger and more complex and, maybe, need more training epochs and/or different learning rates to achieve a full convergence during the fine-tuning phase for evaluation. For example, we were forced to reduce the learning rate to 1e-5 for each model evaluated on TE benchmark to favour convergence. Again, we clarify that the goal of this work is not to beat other systems in the leaderboards, but to show the effectiveness of this approach for complexifying transformer architectures and we think that the results confirm our initial research question. Having complexified BERT matrices by adding LoRA adapters, we have no guarantee, in principle, that the system will not converge to the original BERT-based model setting all adapters to zero and nullify all imaginary part in the complex-valued model. We checked this in various ways and, as shown in Figure 1, some randomly chosen complex-valued components of token embeddings for the CmplxBERTLoRA_16 model show to cover the entire complex space in a uniform way, supporting the idea that the pre-training phase consistently adapted the starting real-valued model to produce reliable complex-valued embeddings. We did also some experiments with a real-valued LoRA model containing about the same number of parameters of CmplxBERTLoRA_8, adding real-valued adapters of rank 16, to investigate if a complex-valued transformer is able to produce better results that an equivalent realvalued one, but such experiments did not show any relevant performance differences between the two models. This work presented a relevant set of experiments for testing the idea of being able to complexify a Transformer encoder architecture like BERT by using complex-valued LoRA adapters. The obtained results on Italian models are very encouraging showing in a clear way that this technique is effective in transforming a real-valued pretrained model into a complex-valued one maintaining the same level of performance. We have to say that the UINAUIL benchmark is not without problems: TE dataset is very small and such large models struggle to reliably converge to a reasonable minimum during training leading to very unstable results. FactA is very problematic as well: classes are strongly skewed and the Max_Freq_Baseline, always choosing the highest-frequency class, is able to achieve an accuracy of 0.967! For all these reasons, we think that these two benchmarks should be excluded from any real evaluation. This pilot study presents only the first step for proposing building blocks based on LoRA adapters for complexifying any kind of transformer, either for representation learning or for text generation or for both processes together. All the complex-valued models were pre-trained on various GPUs for speeding up the experiments, but a general CmplxBERTLoRA model can be trained on a single 12/16GB GPU without problems, while the pretraining of a complex-valued BERT model from scratch would have required at least 4 NVIDIA A100 64GB GPUs for obtaining results in reasonable time. Using LoRA for ‘complexifying’ a model mitigates the need of complex and expensive computational infrastructures not easily available to any scholar.

Despite significant advancements, most datasets and models are predominantly available in English, posing challenges for other languages. This paper presents an Italian resource based on the dataset made available in the FEVER evaluation campaign, created to train and evaluate fact-checking models in Italian. The dataset comprises approximately 240k examples, with over 2k test examples manually validated. Additionally, we fine-tuned a state-of-the-art LLM, namely LLaMA3, on both the original English and translated Italian datasets, demonstrating that fine-tuning significantly improves model performance. Our results suggest that the fine-tuned models achieve comparable accuracy in both languages, highlighting the value of the proposed resource.","In recent years, Automatic Fact Checking (AFC) has assumed a significant role as an instrument to identify fake news. AFC is a process that verifies the truthfulness and accuracy of information, claims, and data contained in a text or speech. The focus is on debunking disinformation and misinformation, intercepting errors, and verifying sources and facts. Automated fact-checking uses AI tools to identify, verify, and respond to misleading claims, using techniques based on natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation, and databases to automatically predict the truthfulness of claims AUTHOR. This is a complex process that involves searching, interpreting, and assessing information. As discussed in AUTHOR a NLP framework for automated fact-checking consists of three stages: claim detection to identify claims that require verification; evidence retrieval to find sources supporting or refuting the claim; and claim verification to assess the truthfulness of the claim based on the retrieved evidence. At first, automating the fact-checking process has been discussed in the context of computational journalism in works like AUTHOR, and has received significant attention in the computational linguistics and, in general, the artificial intelligence communities, surveyed in AUTHOR and more recently in AUTHOR and AUTHOR. In particular, in AUTHOR the authors expose a survey on the topic, describing the early developments that were surveyed in AUTHOR, which is an exhaustive overview of the subject. As with most machine learning paradigms AUTHOR, state-of-the-art methods require datasets and benchmarks. One of the most impactful campaigns for collecting a large-scale benchmark is FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) AUTHOR. In this context, fact-checking involves verifying whether a claim is supported by one or more pieces of evidence. FEVER is a publicly available dataset designed for claim verification against textual sources. It comprises about 180K claims generated by altering sentences extracted from Wikipedia. The claims are classified into three categories: \textsc{Supported} (a piece of evidence exists and it supports the claim), \textsc{Refutes} (a piece of evidence exists and it contradicts the claim), or \textsc{NotEnoughInfo} (there is insufficient evidence to verify the claim). The challenge, therefore, is to retrieve the relevant evidence and verify the accuracy of the claims, categorizing them with the correct label. Many works like FEVER have recently focused on building data and datasets for the task of Fact Verification, achieving very good results AUTHOR. However, all of these datasets are designed for the English language. Although multilingual models exist (e.g., in AUTHOR), fine-tuning a model on a specific language, pre-training it for a specific task and use case, could lead to a significant decline in quality if applied to another language. Few studies have worked on training models for languages other than English. An example is the work presented in AUTHOR, which focuses on developing automated claim detection for Dutch-language fact-checkers. In this work, we propose a FEVER-IT dataset in which the FEVER dataset has been translated into Italian to train the model for the Italian language. Inspired by SQUAD-IT AUTHOR and MSCOCO-IT AUTHOR, we worked to obtain quality data. Although the training set may be affected by translation errors, the test set will not, as it is composed of manually validated data. Furthermore, while the original FEVER dataset contained evidence only for \textsc{Supports} and \textsc{Refutes}, in this work we have also added and translated examples for the \textsc{NotEnoughInfo} category using the heuristics proposed in AUTHOR. This work extends the experience described in AUTHOR, where translations were done using Google API, by using publicly available models ( AUTHOR) and adding data for the \textsc{NotEnoughInfo} category. The contribution of this work is twofold. Firstly, we release FEVER-IT, a corpus with 228K claims each associated with at least one (possibly useful) piece of evidence, including a test set of 2,000 manually validated claims. In addition, we fine-tuned and validated a state-of-the-art model, LLaMA3 AUTHOR, on both the original English dataset and the Italian dataset. While this provides a high-performance model ready for the task in both languages, the primary goal is to assess whether the quality of the Italian data is comparable to the English one. By training the model separately on each dataset, we can evaluate its stability: if the model performs similarly on the manually validated Italian dataset and the English test set, we can conclude that the quality of the Italian data is on par with the English data. Additionally, we want to assess whether using an Italian train dataset, despite the noise from automatic translation, is truly beneficial. LLMs like LLaMA3 can already perform tasks in other languages through zero-shot or few-shot learning, without requiring fine-tuning on a specific dataset, especially if that dataset is noisy. Therefore, we aim to compare the performance on the test set between a LLaMA3 model that hasn’t been fine-tuned on the noisy Italian data and one that has been fine-tuned, to determine whether fine-tuning actually improves results or if the model performs on par or better without it. The experimental results show that the model without fine-tuning achieves an average accuracy of only about 45%. Fine-tuning on the English dataset yields about 90% mean accuracy, while fine-tuning on the Italian dataset results in a percentage quite similar to the fine-tuned English model and much greater than testing without fine-tuning}. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section sec:relwork discusses related work, Section sec:feverit presents FEVER-IT, Section sec:expeval details the experimental measures, and Section sec:concl provides the conclusions.","In this work, we have introduced FEVER-IT, an Italian version of the FEVER dataset, designed to improve the training and evaluation of models for fact verification in the Italian language. Using a machine translation system, we translated a large-scale dataset of 228,000 claims/pieces of evidence pairs and manually validated 2,000 test instances to ensure meaningful evaluations. This enabled us to fine-tune a state-of-the-art LLM, specifically LLaMA3, and assess its performance in both English and Italian. Our experiments demonstrated that the multilingual model, without fine-tuning, performed similarly on both English and Italian datasets, though the accuracy and stability were limited. Fine-tuning significantly improved the model's performance, achieving over 90% accuracy in both languages. This underscores the importance and effectiveness of the translated dataset, even if it contains some noise. Future work will explore the performance of larger models and further refinement of the dataset to enhance accuracy and generalization capabilities or explore more complex settings such as those described in AUTHOR.

In this paper, we propose Prompt Association Test for the Italian language itaPat: a new resource for testing the presence of social bias in different domains in IFLMs. This work also aims to understand whether it is possible to make the responses of these models more fair by using context learning, using ``one-shot anti-stereotypical prompts''.","Large Language Models (LLMs) and Instruction-Following Language Models (IFLMs) have achieved human performances in several NLP applications AUTHOR. Their ability to generate text or respond to prompts is increasingly performing and adaptive to different tasks. However, these models learn from data that frequently contains prejudices and stereotypical associations, as data inherently possesses and reflects the social biases generated by humans. Social bias refers to prejudices, stereotypes, or unfair assumptions individuals or groups hold about others based on factors like race, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or other social characteristics. The LLMs could embed stereotypical associations among social groups during training phase AUTHOR because they learn from huge amounts of data, which may reflect existing social prejudices. The presence of social bias in LLMs can lead to harmful consequences, such as generating biased or discriminatory outputs, perpetuating stereotypes, or unfairly marginalizing certain groups. According with the definition of AUTHOR, we consider a model bias if it systematically prefers the stereotyped association over an anti-stereotyped one. The social bias is the Achille's heel for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications AUTHOR. The presence of bias in the NLP models has been detected by means different strategies. AUTHOR proposed the Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) to detect the stereotypical associations regarding gender and races in the word embedding vectors, while AUTHOR extended it (SEAT) for the Pre-trained Language Models like BERTAUTHOR and ELMO AUTHOR. The stereotypical domains can be also detected by these sentence encoders using benchmarks AUTHOR. The increased use of LLMs AUTHOR and IFLMs AUTHOR, driven by their ease of use, leads to a series of social problems, including those related to the social bias. In fact, despite the increased capabilities on several tasks of these models, they often reproduce biases that can be learned from training data AUTHOR and generate toxic or offensive content AUTHOR. AUTHOR and AUTHOR extended WEAT and SEAT to detect the stereotypical associations respectively in LLMs and IFLMs. Previous works quantify the amount of associations among social groups generated by English-language models, and it is necessary to develop similar approaches for models, both multilingual and Italian, for the Italian language. In this paper, we propose the Italian Prompt Association Test itaPat: a new resource for testing the presence of social biases in Instruction-Following Language Models (IFLMs) for the Italian language. To quantify the presence of social bias, we created a dataset consisting of the adaptation of prompts present in pat. To enhance the Italian-centric nature of this dataset, the adaptations have been carefully designed according to ISTAT (Italian National Institute of Statistics) data. This involves the identification and selection of the most common Italian first names and nationalities that Italians statistically perceive most negatively based on social trends and prejudices. Then, we test these Italian prompts on both multilingual and Italian IFLMs, and observe whether their answers reflect stereotypical associations. If the model responses align with a stereotype, it indicates that it has internalized and reproduced the ``Italian stereotype"" embedded in the data. Finally, we also explore the use of ``one-shot anti-stereotypical prompts'' as a strategy to guide models toward generating fairer and less biased responses. This approach is particularly advantageous because it circumvents the need for computationally intensive fine-tuning or retraining of the models, which would otherwise require substantial resources. Furthermore, our method successfully yields more fairer responses from Italian-focused language models across different social domains.","In this paper, we propose a Prompt Association Test for Italian language itaPat, a resource to quantify the social bias in multilingual and Italian Instruction-Following Language Models (IFLMs) in multiple domains, such as gender, race and age. itaPat is an adaptation of pat AUTHOR on the Italian language. Our experiments with different models show that multilingual model are better at responding to prompts than the Italian models, however they have a greater presence of bias. Consequently, this highlights a significant challenge in the development of AI language models: the need to balance performance improvements with ethical considerations, ensuring that advancements in model capabilities do not compromise the fairness and inclusivity of the outputs generated. Italian models often provide incorrect or repetitive responses, whether stereotypical or anti-stereotypical, which undermines the reliability of the Bias score. Among the Italian models evaluated, LLaMAntino demonstrates the best ability to generate accurate responses; however, it still exhibits a disproportionately high Bias score. Moreover, our proposed methods for enhancing the fairness of model responses lack consistency, as each model exhibits varying levels of responsiveness depending on the specific domain in question. This variability highlights the need for a more tailored approach to bias mitigation that considers the unique characteristics of each model and the contexts in which they operate. We expect itaPat to be an important tool for quantifying the presence of social bias in different dimensions and, therefore, for encouraging the creation of fairer in the multilingual and Italian IFLMs for the Italian language.",1,Language Models

We experimented with various VAD systems and proposed an ensemble VAD system. Our ensemble system shows improvements in speech event detection. This advancement lays a robust foundation for more accurate early detection of mental health issues using DLBs in Italian.","Voice Activity Detection (VAD) refers to the task of identifying the presence of human voice activity in noisy speech, classifying utterance segments as “speech” or “non-speech”. Typically, it involves making binary decisions on each frame of a noisy signal [1]. VAD has a wide range of applications, serving as a crucial component in various fields such as telecommunications, speech recognition systems, and audio surveillance. Nevertheless, the great majority of current works focus on the applicationof VAD to English while there are many aspects that can affect the performance of transferring a VAD system from one language to another, potentially leading to suboptimal results. For instance, voice onset time may vary significantly between languages, affecting the system’s ability to detect speech activity accurately [2]. Additionally, differences in phonetic structures can further complicate the system’s effectiveness across languages. Given these factors, conducting research to evaluate various VAD systems on Italian speech would be highly valuable. Digital Linguistic Biomarkers (DLBs) indicate linguistic features automatically extracted directly from patients’ verbal productions that provide insights into their medical state [3]. Gagliardi and Tamburini [3] proposed the first DLBs extraction pipeline for the early diagnosis of mental disorders in Italian. The extraction of acoustic and rhythmic features relies heavily on the preprocessing step which consists of speech segmentation via VAD. The VAD system adopted by Gagliardi and Tamburini [3] is a statistical VAD system named “SSVAD v1.0” [4], which will be presented and compared to other VAD Systems in Section 2. In this project, we focus on VAD for the Italian language, an area that remains largely unexplored, aiming to find a VAD system that performs better and is more reliable than the one adopted in the original pipeline. The outcomes of this project will serve as a fundamental component in the pipeline for extracting DLBs and replacing the current VAD system. Moreover, our efforts will provide a robust foundation for future work in this domain, facilitating more accurate and early detection of mental health issues using linguistic biomarkers.

This paper is structured into five sections. Section 2 presents the data resources and VAD systems leveraged in this work. Section 3 details the experiments and resources for testing VAD systems. Section 4 presents and discusses the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions.","In this study, we explored and enhanced Voice Activity Detection systems for the Italian language, a relatively under-explored area in speech processing. We experimented with various systems and integrated systems into an ensemble to improve detection accuracy. Our findings indicate that combining predictions from multiple models can lead to better results in detecting speech temporal intervals. This effective ensemble method will be used as a component of a Digital Linguistic Biomarkers extraction pipeline. By enhancing the accuracy of speech segmentation, this method provides a more reliable foundation for extracting meaningful linguistic features for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Future research could focus on refining the ensemble method by incorporating additional linguistic features into VAD systems and exploring their synergistic effects. Additionally, investigating the application of this approach to other languages and dialects could expand its utility.",13,Multimodal

Leveraging explicit features that capture both linguistic style and semantic content, we demonstrate the feasibility of automatically predicting successful writing in fanfiction and we identify a set of robust linguistic predictors that maintain their predictive power across diverse topics and time periods, offering insights into the universal aspects of engaging storytelling. This approach not only enhances our understanding of fanfiction as a genre but also offers potential applications in broader literary analysis and content creation.","The growing proliferation of online literary content has led to the emergence of new genres and storytelling forms, with fanfiction being particularly popular among teens and young adults. Fanfiction consists of stories created by fans (mostly hobby authors) that extend or alter the narrative of existing popular media like books, movies, comics or games, and represents a significant portion of user-generated content on the web AUTHOR. In recent years, the widespread popularity that this genre has assumed has prompted research into the linguistic and stylistic elements that contribute to its success, %remain largely unexplored from a linguistic perspective, particularly in contrast mirroring studies conducted on more traditional literary genres AUTHOR, among others. Understanding the elements that contribute to narrative success is a fascinating area of research with implications across various fields, from literary analysis to digital humanities. From a socio-linguistic perspective, it can offer deeper insights into people and culture. It also has significant applications in areas such as personalized content recommendation and educational technology AUTHOR. While personal interests undoubtedly play a crucial role in predicting a reader's engagement with a literary content, the way information is presented can also evoke different reactions and levels of interaction, ultimately influencing the narrative's success. In this regards, recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning offer a powerful lens for making explicit patterns that may explain the complex interplay between reader engagement and content success. This paper moves in this field and presents a computational analysis focused on Italian fanfiction, addressing the following research questions: i.) Can the success of Italian fanfiction be automatically predicted using stylistic and lexical features of the texts?; ii.) Which types of features demonstrate the highest predictive capability, and how consistent are these features across different time periods and thematic domains?; iii.) To what extent can these features be explained in terms of their contribution to predicting success? Our contributions. i.) We collected a corpus of Italian fanfiction stories enriched with metadata considered as proxies of their success; %; ii.) We investigate the relationship between stylistic and lexical features of stories and their success from a modeling perspective; iii.) We identified the most influential features in success prediction, showing the key role played by form and stylistic related features across time and thematic domains of fanfictions.

Section sec:results discusses the main findings and offers a fine-grained analysis of the classification results in terms of feature explainability. In Section sec:conclusion we summarize key findings and outlining promising directions for future research in this field.","Understanding success factors in literary writing is an evolving area of cross-disciplinary research. This study on Italian fanfiction demonstrated the feasibility of predicting success using computational methods and explainability techniques. Notably, we found that features related to style and structure of texts show greater robustness than lexical ones across different domains and time periods. This suggests that the way a story is crafted may be more universally appealing than specific word choices or thematic elements. We believe that the implications of this study extend far beyond fanfiction research. On the one hand, it provides new methodologies for analyzing online literary phenomena offering potential contributions to digital humanities. From the NLP perspective, it could inform text generation models, potentially guiding the creation of content that resonates more effectively with readers. %to the growing field of digital humanities, offering new methodologies for analyzing and understanding online literary phenomena.

We focus on the terms felix and on its opposite infelix and perform manual annotation of their occurrences in Virgil’s poems using Universal Dependencies for the syntactic analysis and FrameNet for the semantic one. Integrating the approaches of Dependency Syntax and Construction Grammar, we analyze the linguistic contexts in which the two terms occur and identify the different “constructions” (pairings of form and function) that they instantiate. Our methodology is language-independent and has the potential to aid scholars in the comparative analysis of poetic texts, allowing for the detection of hidden parallels in the style and poetics of different texts and authors.","The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the potential of a constructionist and computer-based approach to the analysis of syntax and semantics in a Latin poetic corpus. Our corpus comprises Virgil’s (70–19 BCE) literary works, namely (in chronological order of composition) the Eclogues (Ecl.) or Bucolics, the Georgics (Georg.), and the Aeneid (Aen.). We focus on two lemmas that have been studied as key terms in Virgil’s poetics (e.g. [1]; [2]): felix ‘productive, auspicious, fortunate, lucky, happy’ and its opposite infelix ‘unproductive, unlucky, ill-fated, miserable’. Bellincioni [1] analyzed the meanings of the two terms in Virgil’s works and detected differences in their poetic uses. On the one hand, felix is attested in a variety of contexts, ranging from its (likely original) concrete senses ‘productive’, ‘fruitful’ to more figurative senses linked with prosperity and well-being (granted by divine will). When it qualifies humans, felix takes the religious nuance of ‘favored’ by gods and fate. Gagliardi [2] also stressed the polysemy of felix in the Virgilian corpus: the lemma may refer to fecundity, propitious benevolence, or happiness, acquiring new connotations thanks to innovative uses in Virgil’s poetics. On the other hand, according to Bellincioni [1] infelix is rarely used in the technical sense of ‘infertile’ or in the senses ‘helpless’ and ‘inauspicious’, and in the majority of cases it rather seems to be used to qualify human beings as ‘ill-fated’. In order to identify patterns of the use of these terms in context, we combine a syntactic analysis with a semantic one. Following Osborne and Groß [4] and Osborne, Putnam and Groß [5], we integrate the approaches of Dependency Syntax and Construction Grammar. In doing so, we rely on the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework for the syntactic analysis and on the FrameNet approach for the semantic one, drawing inspiration from previous studies along these lines (e.g. [6]; [7]). This integrated approach allows us, on the one hand, to identify the linguistic contexts in which felix and infelix occur in Virgil’s corpus and, on the other hand, to analyze correspondences between the syntactic and the semantic levels of the Virgilian passages where these two terms are employed. By combining syntactic and semantic analyses, we explore the potential of an approach that integrates Universal Dependencies with FrameNet. In doing so, we aim at demonstrating that ours is a viable methodology to retrieve the contexts in which the two terms occur in Virgil’s corpus and to study the correspondences between their syntactic and semantic uses.","With the present study, we show the potential of a constructionist and computer-based approach in the analysis of a poetic corpus in Latin. By integrating syntactic information based on UD with semantic annotation grounded on FrameNet, we were able to identify recurrent constructions involving two key lemmas of Virgilian poetics, felix and infelix. This enabled us to uncover differences and parallels in the uses of these two terms within Virgil’s language. The present work is a pilot study which may pave the way for future research. Our approach is language-independent, and may thus be applied to different corpora across various languages and historical periods, for instance to explore similarities in the poetics of various authors within different traditions. Our investigation relied on manual annotation for both the syntactic and semantic analyses due to the lack or poor performance of automatic annotation systems for Latin poetry at the time of writing. The feasibility and effectiveness of such systems can vary significantly across different languages, depending on the resources available. Future improvements in automatic annotation for Latin may allow us to scale up this approach to perform analyses of even larger corpora. Virgil’s poems played a crucial role in shaping later poetic traditions for centuries: an interesting application of our integrated approach may thus be to investigate whether the same constructions attested in Virgil’s poems also occur in the works of later poets who are known to have been influenced by him, both in Latin (e.g. Valerius Flaccus’s Argonautica, Silius Italicus’s Punica, Publius Papinius Statius’s Thebaid), as well as in other languages, such as Italian (e.g. Dante Alighieri’s Commedia).",5,Latin Resources

However, creating these exercises is labour-intensive and requires expert knowledge. Effective MCC exercises must be contextually relevant and engaging, incorporating distractors—plausible but incorrect alternatives—to balance difficulty and maintain learner motivation. Despite the increasing interest in utilizing large language models (LLMs) in education, their application in generating English grammar MCC exercises is still limited. Previous methods typically impose constraints on LLMs, producing grammatically correct yet uncreative results. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to independently generate diverse and contextually relevant MCC exercises without predefined limitations. We hypothesize that LLMs can craft self-contained sentences that foster learner's communicative competence. Our analysis of existing MCC exercise datasets revealed issues of diversity, completeness, and correctness. Furthermore, we address the lack of a standardized automatic metric for evaluating the quality of generated exercises. Our contributions include developing an LLM-based solution for generating MCC exercises, curating a comprehensive dataset spanning 19 grammar topics, and proposing an automatic metric validated against human expert evaluations. This work aims to advance the automatic generation of English grammar MCC exercises, enhancing both their quality and creativity.","English grammar Multiple-Choice Cloze (MCC) exercises are widely used tools for enhancing a learner's grammatical proficiency and comprehension skills. They consist of fill-the-gap questions where the gap must be filled by choosing one correct solution (key) among several options. The incorrect alternatives are called distractors. Devising these exercises is a labour-intensive process requiring expert knowledge in language teaching and content creation. The exercises must be contextually relevant to help learners understand how rules apply in real-life situations. This requires crafting sentences and scenarios that are both engaging and educational. Learners have different levels of proficiency, from beginners to advanced. Striking the right balance ensures that learners are neither bored nor frustrated, which is crucial for maintaining their motivation and progress. In MCC exercises this is done by choosing distractors that are incorrect but plausible, thus keeping the exercise challenging for the learner. Studies in Communicative Language Teaching demonstrate that the learner must possess the knowledge of grammatical structures and the ability to compose syntactically well-formed propositions, and they must also acquire the ability to employ grammatical forms in discourse AUTHOR AUTHOR. Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying LLMs in education AUTHOR. However, the adoption of LLMs for English grammar MCC exercise generation is still limited. Some proposals focus on testing vocabulary AUTHOR or use LLMs by constraining their generation capability, for example using fixed part-of-speech sequences AUTHOR. Although the outputs of these models are grammatically correct typically they lack creativity AUTHOR. In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs in automatic exercise generation without hampering their creativity. Our working hypothesis is that LLMs can generate self-contained sentences, recreating situational contexts that elicit the communicative competence of the learner AUTHOR. Our main objective is to understand to what extent can LLMs generate accurate grammar exercises without providing predefined constraints or POS sequences. To pursue this objective, we analyzed the available English grammar MCC exercises dataset AUTHOR. We observed that it has limited diversity, some topics are underrepresented, and there are often mistakes. Existing literature does not offer a single agreed-upon automatic metric for evaluating the quality of the generated grammar exercises. Therefore, we set out to identify such a metric and validate its alignment with human judgment. In this paper, we present a novel solution utilizing an LLM to generate English grammar MCC exercises. Our contribution also focuses on curating an MCC dataset that spans 19 topics. Lastly, we propose an automatic metric to evaluate the exercise's correctness and verify the validity of our contribution thanks to human expert evaluation.","We investigated the use of an LLM to generate English MCC grammar exercises. To that end, we curated a new English grammar MCC exercises dataset. We devised metrics for the automatic evaluation of such exercises. We evaluated our work using said metrics, and a human study involving domain experts. Our findings demonstrate the model's ability to generate exercises suitable for educational use. The generated exercises exhibit a low similarity score, indicating that our method can effectively produce original exercises: a significant advantage from prior art, mostly relying on rule-based methods. We observe that human evaluation correlates positively with the proposed structural compliance metric, corroborating our metric as an indicator of exercise structure correctness and alignment with human expert preferences. We found that a key factor of our method was the availability of high-quality fine-tuning data. One limitation was the presence of many similar exercises in the SC-Dataset AUTHOR we used to build our resource from. After removing similar exercises, only 30% of the original data was left. Another limitation is the sensitivity of the evaluation metric to the Pattern Matcher, concerning the evaluation of the key and the distractors, which caused some false negatives. The curated dataset and model will be available to the community.}.

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have focused on this task in French. We fine-tuned various BERT-based models for French in order to determine which one performed best. It was found that the Flaubert-base-cased model was the most effective (F1-score of 0.94) and that the most frequent categories in our corpus were material possibility and ability, which are both part of the more global alethic category.","In this paper, we present our research into the automatic disambiguation of the French modal verb pouvoir (in English, this verb can be translated by can, could, may o might) in a corpus of semi-structured interviews1 . This problem statement is part of a broader quantitative and qualitative analysis currently underway on modal markers in order to better understand which kinds of modal categories are prevalent in this kind of corpus. As an NLP task, the problem of the automatic disambiguation of modal markers relies on what is generally called “modal sense classification” (MSC). As far as we know, no studies have focused on disambiguating modal verbs using a machine learning approach in French. Our aim is to fill this gap by finding the best fine-tuned BERT model to classify the semantic values of the French modal verb pouvoir in a transcribed spoken corpus. The article is organized as follows. In section 2 we review related work on the task of modal sense classification. Section 3 describes our corpus and our linguistic model. Section 4 presents the annotation of the corpus with an annotation scheme. Section 5 presents our experiments in fine-tuning different BERT models in order to choose the most effective one. Finally, in section 6 we discuss our results and in section 7 we close our contribution with conclusions and suggestions for future research.","This study demonstrates significant first progress in the automatic classification of the French verb pouvoir by finding the best fine-tuned BERT model. Moderate to substantial inter-annotator agreement led to merging some subcategories for more streamlined annotations. The flaubert-base-cased model, with contextual data augmentation, achieved an impressive F1-score of 0.94 with cross-validation, highlighting the importance of context (see section 4.2 “Corpus Context”). However, challenges persist, such as limited training data and the need for better annotation tools and more powerful computational resources. The model struggles with certain deontic usages that humans easily identify. Intentional ambiguity by the speaker also poses a challenge for both annotators and the model. Future work should expand and enrich the dataset and consider training on full texts instead of isolated sentences to capture context better. [8] propose a similar approach, emphasizing the importance of taking a large context around the target token and advocating for the use of full texts as context. In the future, we will also experiment with an augmented context window of 10 lines before and after the target token. These enhancements will improve model robustness and set the stage for further advancements in natural language processing, particularly for classifying semantic values of French modal verbs. This is the first step in a larger project that will soon include the verb devoir (must). More globally, the ultimate goal of our approach is to be able to identify which modal categories are prevalent in any given corpus [16]. Indeed, given that the verb pouvoir is present in all types of texts, the ability to identify its modality becomes a necessary tool for refining the overall analysis of modality in different tasks such as sentiment analysis ([17] or hedge detection ([18]).",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We work with the Queneau's original French version, and the Italian translation by Umberto Eco. We start by comparing how various methods for the detection of automatically generated text, also using different large language models, evaluate the different styles in the opera. We then link this automatic evaluation to distinct characteristic related to content and structure of the various styles. This work is an initial attempt at exploring how methods for the detection of artificially-generated text can find application as tools to evaluate the qualities and characteristics of human writing, to support better writing in terms of originality, informativeness, clarity.","The extraordinary writing ability of the latest chatbots and virtual assistants based on Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant question for anyone who attempts to write today —- be they a scientist, a writer, or a lover: is it worth the effort to engage in the act of writing? For those not hindered by excessive laziness and who, with courage, still tackle writing with determination and passion, this question implies a more specific one: am I writing a text that an artificial intelligence could not have produced? We believe that the answer to this question may, in the future, come from the LLMs themselves given that they are designed to assess the probability of the occurrence of the next word in a text. We envision a future where LLMs, although widely used to produce essentially obvious texts, will assist those who still engage in writing to create texts worth reading, if only because the artificial intelligence, having read and statistically evaluated almost everything ever written, considers them non-obvious and distinct from what it would have produced itself. The ability of LLMs to evaluate the probability of the next word in a text stems from the extensive corpus of writing they are trained on. Consequently, their evaluation of a piece of writing is ultimately based on an indirect comparison between the given text and the entire body of literature they have been exposed to. Using LLMs to assess how much a text differs from the production capabilities of LLMs inherently implies an evaluation of the novelty it represents compared to known literature. Starting to move in this direction, this article explores whether an LLM can be used to help humans answer this question. In this first attempt we do this not based on the content intended for communication but on the style. We have conducted a preliminary study on the possibility of using LLMs to evaluate how and to what extent a certain writing style and/or a specific text differs from what a machine can achieve. We took as a reference Raymond Queneau's ``Exercises in Style'' AUTHOR, which draws from Erasmus of Rotterdam's ``De Utraque Verborum ac Rerum Copia'' AUTHOR a bestseller widely used for teaching how to rewrite pre-existing texts and how to incorporate them into a new composition. In Queneau's work, the same simple story is revisited each time in a different literary style. We asked ourselves and conducted experiments on how much the texts in various styles used by Queneau differ from the writing abilities of LLMs, which have acquired their skills by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text. Calvino had already attempted to answer this question: ``What would be the style of a literary automaton?'' He replied, ``The test for a poetic-electronic machine will be the production of traditional works, of poems with closed metric forms, of novels with all the rules''. We believe it has indeed happened this way, as today's chatbots and virtual assistants are built from a language model. In this work, we provide initial evidence that language models recognize those texts that are more traditional, particularly used in spoken language or by classical characters as more probable while they deem more unlikely experimental and innovative texts. However, we find evidence that even for powerful LLMs it remains difficult to cut a clear line between experimental texts and those that instead incur the risk of becoming unreadable.","This work is a first exploration of the idea of designing tools that evaluate how and to what extent a writing style and/or a specific text differs from what a machine can achieve. We tested for this task the use machine generated text detection tools, under the hypothesis of a correlation between their detection scores and our goal of discovering the many facets that build an original human written text. We applied them to Queneau's exercises in style, in which the same story is written using a rich and varied set of writing styles. We have found a consistent correlation between the scores assigned by detection methods, across detection methods and across languages. The comparison of the styles with their detection scores indicates that lower scores from detection methods are correlated with the use of unusual terms or syntax, while higher scores are more related to styles that are based on a clean and more prose, with a smooth transition among this two extremes. The ranks thus do not indicate a ``better'' or a more ``interesting'' style, yet they confirm Calvino's statement we reported in the introduction: content that is akin to a machine-generated one is the one that produce ``traditional'' content, following the main rules of writing. Writers willing to depart from sounding ``ordinary'' could indeed use detection methods to estimate these aspects on their content, with the caveat that while a mid-level detection score may suggest some original traits in text, low scores may not indicate a more original or interesting text, but they may likely derive from an obscure or plainly unreadable text. Given the positive results of this first investigation, future developments will be based on the use of texts specifically written for this activity. This will have the advantage of having full control over the contents and to have the guarantee that they have never been part of the LLMs training data. \FloatBarrier This work was partially supported by PNRR - M4C2 - Investimento 1.3, Partenariato Esteso PE00000013 - ""FAIR - Future Artificial Intelligence Research"" - Spoke 1 ""Human-centered AI"", funded by European Union - NextGenerationEU.",9,Textual Genres & Literature Linguistics

We analyze the performance of five LLMs on semantically equivalent sentences that are characterized by different syntactic structures. To correctly solve the tasks, a model is implicitly required to correctly parse the sentence. We found out that LLMs struggle when there are more complex syntactic structures, with an average drop of 16.13(\pm 11.14) points in accuracy on Q\&A task. Additionally, we propose a method based on token attribution to spot which area of the LLMs encode syntactic knowledge, by identifying model heads and layers responsible for the generation of a correct answer.","As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more proficient at generating plausible and sounding sentences, it is compelling to determine the extent to which their competence in understanding more or less complex sentences is similar to that of a human being. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating text that appears human-written. Thus, it is intriguing to determine whether the models' text comprehension aligns in some way with human cognitive processes. A peculiarity of natural languages is that the same meaning can be encoded by multiple syntactic constructions. In Italian, for instance, the unmarked sentence follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. However, inversions of this ordering do not necessarily lead to ungrammatical sentences. % In particular, the Subject-Verb-Object order is frequent, but inversion does not lead to ungrammatical sentences. A case in point is represented by cleft sentence, i.e., sentences where the unmarked SVO sequence is violated. This corresponds to specific communicative functions, namely emphasize a component, and it is obtained by putting one element in a separate clause. %, with the use of an empty introductory word such as ""that"" or ""it"" in English or ""che"" in Italian. In particular, Object Relative Clauses -- where the element that is emphasized is the object of the sentence -- are difficult to understand AUTHOR. For example the sentence ``Sono i professori che i presidi hanno elogiato alla riunione d'istituto'' is more challenging for an Italian speaker than its semantically equivalent unmarked version ``I presidi hanno elogiato i professori alla riunione d'istituto'' where the SVO order is restored. Similarly, in Nominal Copular constructions, the inversion of subject and verb clause is documented to cause difficulties in understanding the meaning of the sentence AUTHOR. Hence, syntax plays a crucial role not only in the general construction of language but also in the native speakers ability to comprehend sentences: in fact, a correct syntactic parsing of the sentences is necessary to understand their meaning, and some syntactic structures are preferred over others. To what extent this preference is replicated by LLMs needs to be further explored. Syntax plays a fundamental role not only in the construction but also in the comprehension of language, as evidenced by the preference for certain structures over others. Currently, it is unclear whether this syntactic preference is also observable in LLMs. To understand this, it is necessary to conduct an analysis of the models that considers how syntactic structures are encoded within them. Related work has primarily been based on probing method (i 3 lavori citati), whose results are rather superficial and do not allow us to understand specifically which parts of the input sentence the model focuses on during processing. If the model shows some knowledge about syntax, there should be an area of the model responsible for that. We aim to detect the area of a model responsible for its syntactic knowledge. Extensive work has been devoted to understanding how Transformer-based architectures encode information and one main objective is to localize which area of the model is responsible for a certain behavior AUTHOR. Despite its usage as an explanation mechanism being debated AUTHOR, the attention mechanism is an interesting starting point given its wide use in Transformer architecture. While the attention weights alone cannot be used as an explanation of a model's behavior AUTHOR, an analysis that includes multiple components of the attention module is shown to be beneficial to obtain an interpretation of how a model processes an input sentence AUTHOR. Probing is a common method used to detect the presence of linguistic properties of language in models AUTHOR. Probing consists of training an auxiliary classifier on top of a model’s internal representation, which could be the output of a specific layer, to determine which linguistic property the model has learned and encoded. In particular, it has been proposed to probe Transformer-based models to reconstruct syntactic representations like dependency parse trees from their hidden states AUTHOR. Probing tasks concluded that syntactic features are encoded in the middle layers AUTHOR. Correlation analysis on the weights matrices of the monolingual BERT models confirmed the localization of syntactic information in the middle layers showing that the models trained on syntactically similar languages were similar on middle layers AUTHOR. While an altered word order seems to play a crucial role in Transformer-based models' ability to process language AUTHOR, the correlation between LLMs downstream performance and the encoding of syntax needs to be further explored. In this paper, we initially examine how syntax influences the LLMs' capability of understanding language. %and generating when exposed to different syntactic structures. To achieve this, we will analyze five open weights LLMs -- trained on the Italian Language either from scratch or during a finetuning phase -- and measure their performance in question-answering (Q\&A) tasks that require an implicit parsing of the roles of words in the sentence to provide the correct answer. We use an available set of Q\&A tasks designed for Italian speakers AUTHOR and propose similar template-based questions for two other datasets of Italian sentences characterized by different syntactic structures (Section sec:task). The results show that the models are affected by the different syntactic structures in solving the proposed tasks (Section sec:qa_res): LLMs struggle when more complex syntactic structures are present, with an average drop in accuracy of 16.13(\pm 11.14) points. We then propose a method -- based on norm-based attribution AUTHOR-- to localize where syntactic knowledge is encoded by identifying the models' attention heads and layers that are responsible for the generation of a correct answer (Section sec:localizingattr). Although some differences can be observed across the five LLMs, we notice that syntactic information is more widely included in the middle and top layers of the models.","In this paper, we have investigated how semantically equivalent sentences are processed by LLMs in Italian when their syntax differs. We tested LLMs trained on the Italian - or with Italian data in the pre-trainig material - and measured how their capabilities in a battery of Q\&A tasks %in a Q question-answering task that %implicitly rely on parsing the correct role of words in a sentence to be solved. Our findings confirm that cleft sentences and construction with an inversion of subject and verb are difficult to understand also for LLMs - similarly to what observed for humans.

Our methodology is typologically unbiased and computationally accessible, allowing for an easy extension to other languages, under the sole requirement of a dictionary. We make our scripts and generated artifacts publicly available at . We leave several directions open to future work. We have experimented with a single dataset, a single model and a single lexical database; varying either of these coordinates and aggregating the results should help debias our findings. We have only looked for semantic generalizations across hyperonymic taxonomies -- looking at other kinds of lexical relations might yield different semantic observations. Our chosen metric of relevance is by construction limited to first-order pairwise interactions, failing to account for exceptional cases or conditional associations. Finally, we had to resort to computational acrobatics through English in order to access necessary tools and resources. This is yet another reminder of the disparities in the pace of `progress' of language technology, and a call for the computational inclusion of typologically diverse languages.",22,Distributional Semantics

As for the syntactic layer of annotation, the de facto standard for dependency-based annotation is Universal Dependencies (UD),.} an initiative that provides machine-readable annotations for a wide variety of languages, including historical languages AUTHOR. At the current state of art, Contemporary Italian is well-represented in UD, whereas Old Italian is only represented by one annotated text (a portion of the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri). The creation of additional Old Italian annotated data is therefore advisable. %to facilitate cross-Italian studies Since a fully manual annotation process is time-consuming and requires significant effort, we aim to expedite it by using a parser that pre-parses the data, leaving the human annotator with only a manual revision task. To address this, given the scarcity of Old Italian data, we create a combined parser using both Contemporary and Old Italian data.

We observe that combining Contemporary Italian and Old Italian data, even though it increases the data size of the model, does not lead to better LAS and UAS accuracy scores. This confirms, in line with other studies AUTHOR, that having an in-domain training set is preferable. Additionally, we notice that the model trained on OI data performs better on Contemporary Italian texts than the reverse (i.e. models trained on Contemporary data on OI texts). To explain these results, we investigate the syntactic complexity of each test set (OI, CI-ISDT, and CI-VIT). Specifically we evaluate sentence length, tree depth, lexical density and the type-token ratio. We notice that the tests differ only in the sentence length. We then proceed to calculate another parameter of syntactic complexity, namely non-projectivity. We discover that OI texts present a higher number of non-projective sentences. We hypothesize that the high level of non-projectivity could be connected to the genre of OI text, namely poetry. Thus far, the lack of UD treebanks for OI prose texts and for CI poetry texts have prevented us from investigating whether the high degree of non-projectivity observed in OI test (based on the Italian-Old treebank) is characteristic of the poetry genre or specific to OI. Such question will be left for further studies. Finally, we are currently working to increase the amount of manually annotated OI data, expanding both the range of authors and the genres of the texts considered. This will allow us to evaluate the model's performance both within and outside its domain (in terms of authorship and text typology), as well as to assess its potential applicability to other OI texts..",4,Syntax and Dependency Treebanks

Two main trends stand out in the context of sexism recognition: the focus on overt forms of sexism such as misogyny on social media and tackling the problem as a text classification task. The main objective of this work is to introduce a new approach to tackle sexism recognition as a sequence labelling task, operating on the token level rather than the document level. To achieve this goal, we introduce (i) the FGSDI (Fine-Grained Sexism Detection in Italian) corpus, containing Italian newspaper articles annotated with fine-grained linguistic markers of sexism, and (ii) a two-step pipeline that sequentially performs sexism detection on the sentence level and sexism classification on the token one. Our primary findings include that (i) tackling the task of sexism recognition as a sequence labelling task is possible, however, a large amount of labelled data is needed; (ii) leveraging few-shot learning for sexism detection proves to be an effective solution in scenarios where only a limited amount of data is available; (iii) the proposed pipeline approach allows for better results compared to the baseline by doubling the overall precision and achieving a better F1-score.","According to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis AUTHOR AUTHOR, language shapes the way we think and interact with the world. It becomes therefore crucial to analyse our usage of linguistic expressions to reveal the intricate dynamics of societal norms, power structures, and cultural values embedded within our belief system. In this context, language can also become a vehicle for different forms of bias and discrimination, including sexism. Sexism in language encompasses a variety of phenomena, ranging from more subtle ones, nested within the grammar and semantics choices we make when talking about women, to more overt instances of misogyny, characterized by aggressiveness and violence against individuals based on their gender identity. \newline In recent years, sexism and misogyny detection and classification have witnessed a growing interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially after the advent of transformers models AUTHOR, which unravelled new possibilities in nearly every NLP task. However, these efforts have mainly focused on misogyny and hate speech in general, tackled as text classification tasks on the document level, and specifically within the context of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. \newline The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we concentrate on specific linguistic markers of sexism introducing more fine-grained classes than those usually considered in the sexism detection and classification tasks. %we propose the FGSDI (Fine-Grained Sexism Detection in Italian) corpus of Italian newspaper articles that we annotated following the guidelines in appendix sec:appendix_b. Inspired by linguistic work by Alma Sabatini AUTHOR, we propose a new annotation scheme and corpus for fine-grained sexism detection, resulting in the FGSDI (Fine-Grained Sexism Detection in Italian) corpus of Italian newspaper articles with the annotation guidelines released in appendix sec:appendix_b. Second, we address the recognition of linguistic markers of sexism as a token-level classification task, assigning a label to each token according to the fine-grained classes introduced before. This constitutes an innovation in that, to the best of our knowledge, no other work---in Italian or other languages---has tackled this task at such a granularity. \newline In particular, we compare two different approaches. The first one, which we used as baseline, consists of fine-tuning a RoBERTa AUTHOR model on the token classification task using whole texts as input. The second, novel one is a two-step pipeline approach inspired by AUTHOR which performs sexism detection and classification subsequently. The sexism detection task is tackled as binary classification applied at the sentence level. Sentences classified as potentially containing linguistic markers of sexism will then undergo the second step of the pipeline, which again involves classification on the token level.%This method constitutes a further novelty of the current work","This work aimed to bridge a gap in the research area of sexism detection and classification in Italian by the following contributions. First, we proposed the FGSDI (Fine-grained Sexism Detection in Italian) corpus for which we, importantly, provided new in-depth annotation guidelines. They are based on foundational linguistic work by AUTHOR and can be applied to other text genres in the future. Second, differently from previous research, we modelled the task of sexism classification as a sequence labelling instead of a text classification task. To achieve this goal, we compared two approaches, the baseline and the two-step pipeline, which allowed for a better overall performance on the task. \newline Working on enriching the corpus with new articles annotated with relevant labels would be the biggest contribution to bring this project forward. At the same time, having multiple annotators could enhance insights on the annotations and lower the risk of bias and subjectivity related to having a single annotator. Moreover, the modularity of the pipeline makes it open for further experimentation, especially in scenarios where more relevant data are available. One example could be using the multi-class classification setting of SetFit, which was excluded from the final pipeline since it performed slightly worse than the binary setting we ultimately used. Finally, further improvements can be made to the use of coreference resolution, which in many cases is not accurate in recognizing occurrences of the same referent in text.

By using NLP and corpus linguistics tool, this research aims at decoding patterns of content and style in SNs. In particular, we explore variation in linguistic features in SNs across sociolinguistic factors (age, gender, addressee, time period) and between text type -- referred to as genre -- (letters vs. online posts). To this end, we use topic models, subjectivity analysis, and sentiment and emotion analysis. Results highlight how both discourse and emotion expression, show differences depending on genre, gender, age group and time period. We suggest a more nuanced approach to personalized prevention and intervention strategies based on insights from computer-assisted linguistic analysis.","This paper investigates the language of suicide notes, with the goal of uncovering patterns of discourse, topics, and emotional expression across various sociolinguistic factors and relationship dynamics, spanning over 100 years. A suicide note (SN) has been defined in the literature as ""any available text by a suicide which was authored shortly before death"" ( AUTHOR: 26). \par The importance of a detailed analysis of suicide notes has been acknowledged in the scholarly debate ( AUTHOR). In fact, SNs have been widely studied in linguistics, sociology, and psychology starting with the publication in 1959 of Osgood and Walker's seminal work ( AUTHOR). Since then, the language of SNs has been investigated mainly through Genre Analysis ( AUTHOR), with some scholars working with corpus methods ( AUTHOR). Lately, big corpora of SNs have been collected through the Web and used for computational analyses (inter alia AUTHOR). \par Research on SNs is naturally practical, being focused on suicide prevention ( AUTHOR), identification ( AUTHOR), and authenticity ( AUTHOR). For instance, the study by AUTHOR uses classification algorithms to help mental health professionals distinguish between genuine and elicited suicide notes. This -- the authors claim -- can in turn help developing a prediction strategy of repeated suicide attempts, as suicide notes offer valuable insights into specific personality states and mindsets. Similarly, AUTHOR suggests that analysing SNs may contribute to assessing the risk of repeated suicide attempts. \par Despite the area being well-researched, especially in forensic linguistics, current analyses of SNs present several shortcomings. Given the difficulty of accessing data, scholars have either used dubious source material (such as the letters published on the blog \href{https://theholydark.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/some-painfully-edifying-reading-suicide-notes/}{""The Holy Dark""}), or have reused and reanalysed SNs written by famous people (such as Virginia Woolf and Kurt Cobain, e.g., AUTHOR). Moreover, there is no study to date -- to the best of the authors' knowledge -- that analyses of SNs using text type, which we refer to as genre, or sociolinguistic factors (such as gender, age, addressee, or time period) as covariates. \par In the present paper, we set out to perform corpus and computational analyses on a novel dataset of authentic suicide notes. Specifically, we aim to explore whether and to what extent SNs style and content vary according to genre (letter vs. online post) and sociolinguistic factors (the victim's gender and age, as well as the addressee and time period of the SN). To this end, we employ Structural Topic Modelling ( AUTHOR) and keyword analysis, subjectivity analysis ( AUTHOR), and sentiment and emotion analysis ( AUTHOR).","This mixed-methods study analysed the content and style of 76 SNs written over the course of a century, using genre, several sociolinguistic factors, and relationship dynamics as covariates. First of all, three main topics emerged from our corpus, that we labelled as Explanations, Anguish, and Connectedness. Looking at the differences in topical prevalence between the two text types, we observed that online posts displayed less private feelings (e.g., anguish and pain) and greater polarized emotion words and swearwords. \par Subjectivity analysis revealed that SNs tended to be more subjective than objective, irrespective of the genre. Some differences based on addressees were identified in the corpus; for example, SNs directed toward close relationships (i.e., life-partners and family) showed higher subjectivity scores, suggesting a more profound and personal style, compared to those directed toward the broader (internet) public. \par As far as sentiment analysis is concerned, negative sentiment was dominant in the corpus (i.e. three times more frequent than neutral or positive sentiment), especially in online posts. Then, the analysis of emotions revealed that sadness was the main emotion in the corpus. This evident presence of sadness and negative sentiment reflects the complex emotional challenges and inner struggles that victims experienced at the time they wrote their SNs. Although sadness was the most common emotion in both letters and online posts, it occurred more frequently in the latter text type. Also, letters tended to convey more positive emotions (e.g., joy) more frequently than online posts. Finally, the analysis revealed that sadness was more common in the SNs written by female victims and by teenagers.\par All in all, our results reveal that the content, discourse, and emotional expression in SNs vary as a function of genre, sociolinguistic factors, and relationship dynamics. These differences uncover the need of taking into account specific social, demographic, and cultural variables when designing and implementing suicide prevention and intervention strategies. In this sense, we believe that corpus-based and NLP research on SNs can contribute to the improvement of these personalized strategies. The research presented in this paper was conducted while C. R.

These strategies, exemplified by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-Aided Language Models (PAL), have been shown to reason well in monolingual contexts, primarily in English. However, there has been limited investigation into their capabilities in other languages, especially Italian. To gain a deeper understanding of the role of reasoning methods, we propose a multidimensional analysis tailored to Italian, focusing on arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of reasoning methods varies significantly beyond English. Expressly, CoT, which relies on natural language demonstrations, is limited to English. Conversely, the structured nature of PAL in-context demonstrations facilitates multilingual comprehension, enabling LLMs to generate programmatic answers in Italian as well. Finally, for a more complete overview, we observe that additional alignment methods do not improve downstream performances; in contrast, in some cases, they restrict the abilities of the original models.","Large language models (LLMs) are able to tackle tasks using prompts formed by structured patterns, a process known as in-context learning AUTHOR. This method allows the models to solve tasks without modifying their underlying parameters, relying solely on the provided inputs. The success of in-context learning has consequently heightened interest in analysing the factors that influence its effectiveness AUTHOR. Regarding reasoning methods, two effective strategies have emerged: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) AUTHOR and Program-Aided Language Models (PAL) AUTHOR. CoT decomposes a reasoning task into a series of intermediate steps using natural language, making it more general and human-understandable. In contrast, PAL employs Python functions to provide reasoning solutions, with its step-by-step programming approach leading to more systematic and structured reasoning. [t!] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.92\textwidth]{img/solo_ita new cross_lingual.pdf proposed in our analysis. We explore the impact of in-context demonstrations beyond English and the performances achieved by different LLMs (\S sec:models). *As indicated in the figure, we have translated two examples of prompts from Italian to English. Although earlier research primarily showcased the functioning of reasoning methods in English, recent studies have expanded to explore multilingual approaches. \citet{shi2022language} shown that the effectiveness of CoT rationales is limited to the languages most represented in LLMs pre-training data. \citet{huang2023languages} addressed the problem by proposing prompting mechanisms that translate the problem into English, while \citet{ranaldi-etal-2024-empowering} elicit multi- and cross-lingual alignments for enabling reasoning, or \citet{ranaldi-etal-2024-tree} self-correction mechanisms. The focus is limited to proposing performance solutions for a few languages, leaving behind the study of the role and the impacts of languages such as Italian. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study to evaluate the role of reasoning methods in Italian. Taking previous work a step further, we study the operation of reasoning methods by analysing the effects of different types of reasoning methods on LLMs' Italian reasoning capabilities. This leads to the main research questions of this paper: (i) What role do natural language and structured in-context demonstrations play in reasoning planning in Italian? (ii) What are the impacts and limits of natural language demonstrations? (iii) Do Italian-aligned and Italian-centred models respond differently to reasoning methods? To answer these questions, we operate via CoT and PAL (shown in Table tab:example_Native_CoT and Table tab:example_Native_PAL). For multilingual CoT, we use natural language demonstrations both in English and in Italian following \citet{shi2022language}. Instead, for PAL, we propose a novel method by extending the original in English AUTHOR. We use reasoning tasks covering mathematical, commonsense reasoning, and natural language inference tasks in original versions (English) and adapted to Italian \href{https://github.com/lranaldii/italian_arithmetic_reasoning}{(resources available)}. These tasks are MGSM AUTHOR and MSVAMP AUTHOR, which consist of mathematical reasoning problems, and XCOPA AUTHOR, PAWS-X AUTHOR and XLNI AUTHOR which consist of commonsense reasoning and natural language inference. Finally, we select a range of different LLMs, we employ GPTs AUTHOR models for the results obtained in multilingual tasks, Phi-3 AUTHOR, and Mixtral AUTHOR for the results obtained in Italian benchmarks, different versions of Llama-2 and Llama-3 AUTHOR (adapted version for Italian, i.e., Llamantino-2 and -3 AUTHOR) and finally two Italian-centered LLMs for the improvements achieved by smaller-scale versions. We operate using the original models, and we propose aligned versions using state-of-the-art instruction-tuning methods based on synthetic data AUTHOR transferred for multilingual cases AUTHOR. The main contribution and findings of our paper are: \item Reasoning methods improve performance in Italian reasoning tasks as well as in English. However, although both methods bring tangible benefits, several limitations emerge in the natural language demonstrations employed in CoT. On the other side of the coin, we observe that the structured reasoning demonstrations (i.e., PAL) elicit the models to plan the solution in a more modularised way. Consequently, this benefits the final performance in both English and non-English tasks. \item We display the positive impact of structured in-context demonstrations on solution planning in Italian. We then demonstrate that since structured reasoning demonstrations are less ambiguous than natural language, they are more adaptable for math reasoning tasks and have a more noticeable impact in more articulate languages such as Italian. \item Finally, we show that the different LLMs analyzed in our contribution are able to understand problems in both English and Italian. However, performance in English is higher despite different approaches used to equate Italian and English proficiency. This reveals that the limitation is not derived from proficiency in a specific language but rather from the language's intrinsic difficulty To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates the impact of reasoning methods for the Italian and demonstrates how these strategies can consistently boost LLMs' performance, equipping them with the ability to generate step-wise explanatory reasoning for their predictions. To facilitate the reproduction, we share the data used at the following \href{https://github.com/lranaldii/italian_arithmetic_reasoning}{link}.","The advances of reasoning methods emerge beyond the English. Our analysis shows that properly elicited LLMs are capable of delivering reasoned answers in Italian as well. Indeed, by operating via CoT and PAL, we revealed that in-context demonstrations play a strategic role in improving performance in direct proportion to their quality and quantity. Our research highlights the need for a customised strategy for employing reasoning methods for LLMs in different languages. It supports the demand for a reasonable combination of model scale, reasoning technique, and strategic use of in-context learning to elicit the prospect of multilingual LLMs.",1,Language Models

Our experiments show that expectations in terms of usefulness and trustworthiness of LLM-generated explanations are not met, as their ratings decrease by 47.78% and 64.32%, respectively, after treatment. Further, our results suggest caution in using LLMs for explanation generation of abusive language detection due to (i) their cultural bias, and (ii) difficulty in reliably evaluating them with empirical metrics. In light of our results, we provide three recommendations to use LLMs responsibly for explainable abusive language detection.","Explainability is a crucial open challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research on abusive language AUTHOR as increasing models' complexity AUTHOR, models' intrinsic bias AUTHOR, and international regulations AUTHOR call for a shift in perspective from performance-based models to more transparent models. Moreover, recent studies have shown the benefits of explanations for users AUTHOR and content moderators AUTHOR on social media platforms. The former can benefit from receiving an explanation for why a certain post has been flagged or removed whereas the latter are shown to annotate toxic posts faster and solve doubtful annotations thanks to explanations. Several efforts have moved towards explainable abusive language detection in the past years, like the development of datasets containing rationales (i.e., the tokens in the text that suggest why the text is hateful) AUTHOR or implied statements (i.e., description of the implied meaning of the text) AUTHOR, and shared tasks on explainable hate speech detection AUTHOR, inter alia. With Large Language Models (LLMs) like FLAN-T5 AUTHOR showing remarkable performance across tasks and human-like text generation AUTHOR, recent studies have explored LLMs for explainable hate speech detection, wherein classification predictions are described through natural language explanations AUTHOR. For instance, AUTHOR used chain-of-thought prompting AUTHOR of LLMs to generate explanations for implicit hate speech detection. However, most of these studies rely on empirical metrics like BLEU AUTHOR to evaluate the generated explanations automatically. Consequently, the human perception and implications of these explanations remain understudied, as well as the extent to which empirical metrics approximate human judgements. AUTHOR recruited crowdworkers to evaluate the level of hatefulness in tweets and the quality of explanations generated by GPT-3. Instead, we conduct an expert survey investigating four LLMs and five learning strategies across multi-class abusive language detection tasks to answer the following questions: RQ1: How well do LLM-generated explanations for abusive language detection match human expectations? RQ2: How well do empirical metrics align with human judgements? RQ3: What makes LLM-generated explanations good, according to experts?","In this paper, we conducted a before-and-after study to understand human expectations and judgements of LLM-generated explanations for multi-class abusive language detection tasks. Contrarily to previous research AUTHOR, we investigated multiple LLMs and learning techniques, and we surveyed AI experts who are familiar with abusive language research instead of crowdworkers. We found that human expectations in terms of usefulness and trustworthiness of LLM-generated explanations are not met: after seeing these explanations, the usefulness and trustworthiness ratings decrease by 47.78% and 64.32%, respectively. Secondly, our results show that empirical metrics commonly used to evaluate textual explanations are highly volatile with respect to each other, even when they measure the same type of similarity (i.e., semantic vs. syntactic), and therefore pointing at the need of more reliable metrics for the empirical evaluation of textual explanations. In general, BERTScore and METEOR metrics exhibit the strongest correlation with human judgements. Lastly, our study provides evidence of the desiderata for LLM-generated explanations, suggesting that explanations should be coherent with human reasoning rather than model reasoning. Participants value the most textual explanations that are relevant and exhaustive to the text they refer to, while being logically and linguistically correct. Justifications for this preference lie on the fact that abusive language detection heavily relies on additional context and knowledge about slang and slurs, for which receiving an explanation is helpful to participants' understanding of the text. Future work should investigate whether this preference holds for other domains as well. In light of our findings, we conclude with three recommendations to use LLMs responsibly for explainable abusive language detection: (1) be aware of the cultural bias these models might exhibit when generating free-text explanations, which can further harm targeted groups; (2) if possible, instruction fine-tune LLMs for explanation generation of abusive language detection. This not only could ensure the generation of structured explanations as advised by previous research AUTHOR but it also returns the highest evaluation scores, both empirically and expert-wise, when using knowledge-guided prompts; (3) opt for a combination of empirical metrics to evaluate textual explanations when no human evaluation is possible, since no particular empirical metric seems to generalise across different learning techniques, models and datasets, making the ground-truth lie somewhere in between BERTScore (upper bound) and BLEU (lower bound).

We discuss relations between content layers (such as proof or support) as well as unscrupulous techniques compromising visual content. The study is based on fakes reported and analyzed by PolitiFact and comprises documents from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We identify several pervasive phenomena currently, affecting the impact of manipulative content on the reader and the possible strategies for effective de-bunking actions, and discuss possible research directions.","Manipulative online content (fake news, propaganda, among others) is growing at an alarming rate, hindering our access to truthful and unbiased information and thus threatening principles of the democratic society. The problem has been addressed by professional journalists, who -- with the help of crowd-workers -- fight a never-ending battle to prevent information contamination. To enable a large-scale response to the misinformation threat, the AI community has invested a considerable effort into building competitive models for identifying non-transparent content, such as false claims or altered videos (deep fakes). However, we still lack a thorough understanding of the manipulative content and multiple aspects affecting its perception and impact on the reader. This paper aims at an in-depth analysis of one of such aspects, namely, the interaction between different (multimedia) layers of the manipulative message. More specifically, we study the semantics underlying the relation between multimedia and textual parts of the fake news.

Multimedia content, such as videos, reels, photos, screenshots or images is becoming increasingly popular in social media: it is an appealing and powerful way of expressing and/or enhancing one's message. Nevertheless, as a scientific community, we still have little understanding of the way the authors integrate multimedia into their content: most research so far has focused on a specific component and not on their interplay. Our study aims at identifying the role of multimedia part of manipulative messages. [] \centering \subfloat[Biden to teachers: “They're not somebody else's children.

RIP]{\includegraphics[width=60mm]{photo-illustration.png} %% illustration, ok Figure example:fig shows some examples from potential fakes analyzed by PolitiFact. We observe different relations between the text and the image. In particular, in (example:figa), the video is supposed to prove the claim by providing direct evidence, whereas in (example:figb), the image provides a support (appeal to authority). In (example:figc), the image is a visual paraphrase of the claim, enhancing its appeal but not providing extra proof, support or informational material. Finally, in (example:figd), the photo is an illustration that, while depicting the discussed person, does not aim at being relevant to the claim's veracity or impact. While understanding the relation between the image and the text is interesting from the scientific perspective, it is also a crucial prerequisite for efficient and meaningful fact-checking response. For example, if a supposed proof is a compromised photo, the response should highlight this fact (e.g., the video in (example:figa) has been cropped misrepresenting the quote, which should be highlighted in the fact-checking report). On the contrary, if a compromised photo is used as a mere illustration, the effective fact-checking report should focus on the textual claim per se. Another important angle is the issue with the multimedia part. In our example, the video in (example:figa) is cropped. On the contrary, (example:figb) represents an authentic screenshot, yet, it has been miscaptioned by the claim: an older content, irrelevant for the current events/topics, has been repurposed. The current paper focuses on these two aspects to analyze empirically the interplay between multimedia and textual components in fake news, as identified by PolitiFact. To this end, we reannotate the PolyFake dataset AUTHOR with fine-grained labels reflecting multimedia aspects.","We have presented an in-depth analysis of the interaction between textual and multimedia components of compromised social media documents. We have identified several high-impact issues, insufficiently studied by the community at the moment. These include the interaction between different modalities, the role of the multimedia part and its impact on selecting the successful fact-checking strategy, the difference between platforms and media types (current NLP studies predominantly focus on Twitter and images) and the importance of a more principled approach to content re-use.

We monitor compromised posts on major social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok) for one year, tracking the changes in their visibility and availability. We show that data persistence is an important issue for manipulative content, on a larger scale than previously reported for online content in general. Our findings also suggest a (much) higher data decay rate for the platforms suffering most from online disinformation, indicating an important area for data collection/preservation.","Manipulative online content is rapidly becoming a more and more pervasive issue for the modern society: by deliberately biasing our information flow, unscrupulous content writers can and do affect our emotional state, beliefs, reasoning and both online and offline behaviour. It is therefore not surprising that this has become a central issue for various stakeholders, from journalists and fact-checkers to NLP researchers both in academia and in the industry. Given the current rapid growth in data-driven studies of manipulative content, it is essential to have a reliable overview of data persistence issues in this specific domain: compromised content is often very dynamic and changes or becomes unavailable over time, raising reproducibility concerns, From the readers' perspective, the visibility of compromised content over time affects directly its impact: a removed or strongly downgraded document is unlikely to be read/recovered and cannot be used to promote or support other fakes. From the research and development perspective, data persistence is crucial for benchmarking, ensuring fair comparison between models as well as even simply providing them with high-quality real-life training and testing examples. Starting from already a decade ago, NLP benchmarking campaign studies AUTHOR report data persistence issues for online content, as used in various shared tasks, reporting around 10% of entries missing compared to the original dataset (gold standard). These shared tasks, however, are based almost exclusively on Twitter and do not focus specifically on compromised content. We believe that a large proportion of manipulative content is created on purpose by professional copywriters who might have different goals and motivations to keep their texts online (e.g., for click-bait purposes) or remove them (e.g., to reduce the reputation loss from being exposed as unreliable). Our work focuses specifically on the lifespan of fact-checked compromised content. We go beyond the naive binary present vs. removed view, studying more nuanced cases as well. In particular, we track compromised online posts over time for the appearance of explicit platform-specific reliability labels (e.g. ""out of context""), obfuscation (the common situation when the online content is -- fully or partially -- rendered either very blurred or as a black/white box, with a message raising awareness of its limited reliability; this content, however, is still accessible to the user upon an extra click), and author-generated edits, as well as complete content removal. More specifically, we address the following research questions: \item[RQ1:] How persistent is the compromised content? How does its visibility and availability change over time? \item[RQ2:] What is the typical timeline for interaction between the content generators and fact-checkers? How -- if at all -- do content writers alter their posts after being exposed as problematic by fact checkers? \item[RQ3:] Are the trends different across platforms? To this end, we analyze two datasets (in English) of social media documents, fact-checked by PolitiFact.) is an independent journalistic agency and one of the most experienced fact-checking organizations, providing detailed analytics for non-transparent online content since 2007.","This paper aims at an in-depth analysis of data persistence for publicly fact-checked online content. After one year of monitoring thoroughly online posts fact-checked by PolitiFact, we have observed the following findings. First, the data persistence is a crucial and underrated issue for compromised content, with considerable decay rates. Second, the decay trends differ across platforms, with Facebook, TikTok and Instagram showing much less data persistance. Third, the decay starts immediately, with 12% of the compromised posts getting deleted at (or before) the publication of the PolitiFact report and 20% becoming unavailable within a week. This suggests an urgent need for a concentrated effort on timely collecting real-life fakes if we want to go beyond synthetic or simplistic datasets and train impactful fact-checking models. In the future, we want to analyze further aspects of the decay issues for the compromised content. Thus, we plan to add more fact-checking outlets beyond PolitiFact to see if there are any effects due to the report itself. Second, we plan to study in more detail the difference in online behaviour (content removal) between anonymous users, non-anonymous users and public figures. Finally, we plan to expand our research on interaction between content writers and fact-checkers (""editing"").

We evaluate zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques on two datasets: SemEval-2019 Task 4 and a headline-specific corpus. Collaborating with a political science expert, we incorporate domain-specific knowledge and structured reasoning steps into our prompts, particularly for the CoT approach. Our findings reveal that some prompting strategies work better than others, specifically on LLaMA, depending on the dataset and the task. This unexpected result challenges assumptions about ICL efficacy on classification tasks. We discuss the implications of these findings for In-Context Learning (ICL) in political text analysis and suggest directions for future research in leveraging large language models for nuanced content classification tasks.","%motivations The proliferation of hyperpartisan news content in digital media has become a significant challenge for modern societies, potentially undermining democratic processes and social cohesion. Hypepartisan news consists of politically polarized content presented through the usage of rhetorical bias. In the media landscape, news outlets disseminate information using proprietary websites and social networks. Each news outlet frames the narratives of the facts based on their political leaning, influencing the content with rhetorical biases, emotional purposes, ideology, and reporting the facts while omitting parts AUTHOR. To improve the virality of the news, even mainstream journalists adopted click-bait practices like eye-catching titles AUTHOR. Furthermore, the news not only stands for one opinion but could have an underlying political background that manifests through a specific vocabulary or assumptions against the opposite political leaning AUTHOR. This type of news could radicalize the voters because of their emotional language AUTHOR. When there is a massive usage of these techniques, we can consider news extremely partisan toward a particular political leaning. Although hyperpartisan news can share traits with misinformation and disinformation, it cannot be classified within these domains because the intent is not deceptive. For this reason, hyperpartisan news detection is closer to propaganda. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for tackling complex NLP tasks, including detecting nuanced linguistic phenomena such as bias and partisanship. Among these models, LLama3 AUTHOR, developed by Meta AI. This research makes use of the new LLM recently released by Meta AI, Llama3-8b-Instruct, fine-tuned and optimized for dialogue/chat use cases, to explore its application in the detection of both hyperpartisan news headlines and articles. LLMs can be prompted with instructions to perform classification tasks. Thus, we intend to use this open source model. In our case, by prompting the model with instructions and context, we are in the In-Context Learning (ICL) domain, a learning approach different from fine-tuning that does not require to update models' weights AUTHOR. The study aims to investigate the efficiency and compare the performances of the following ICL techniques: 0-shot with a general prompt and a specific prompt, few-shot with a different number of examples and Multi-task Guided CoT. We investigate how carefully crafted prompts with the help of a political expert can guide the model to identify subtle indicators of extreme political bias in news articles, leveraging the model's deep understanding of language and context. Our approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning methods, which often struggle with the complex and evolving nature of partisan language. Furthermore, we can include definitions of the political phenomena of our interest in the prompt to further define the task and narrow the application domain. By focusing on ICL to provide context and background information, we seek to: \item Develop a flexible and adaptable system that can identify hyperpartisan content across various topics and writing styles without the need for extensive retraining; \item Reduce ambiguity and guide the model towards the desired outcome; \item Minimize the influence of biases in the training data, by incorporating diverse perspectives and examples. This research not only contributes to the field of automated content analysis but also aims to compare the efficiency of prompting techniques and to analyze if LLMs are valuable tools for classification task via ICL. The structure of the paper is as follows. In section RelatedWork we discuss the related literature; section ExperimentalSetting describes the experimental set-up we adopted and the methodology; section Results&Discussion covers the findings of our experiment comparing them based on the method used and highlights the limitation of our approach; section Conclusion reports the main findings and future research. The main contributions of the paper are the following: \item We evaluated the state-of-the-art model Llama3-8b-Instruct on two benchmark datasets in political domain; \item We assessed how well the model performs under different inference approaches: zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, and Multi-task Guided Chain-of-Thought reasoning \item Introduction of external in-domain knowledge in the prompt and segmentation of reasoning steps in the CoT considering the difficulty of the micro-tasks.","In this paper, we study the reliability of a SOTA model like Llama3-8b-Instruct for classification tasks in the political domain, namely to detect hyperpartisan articles and headlines comparing different prompting techniques. We cast the problem of the classification task using the generative capabilities of LLMs. Experiment results contradict the hypothesis that feeding the model with more context could lead to better performances AUTHOR. Indeed, in our case, the 0-shot approach was the most efficient. An interesting future direction would be building a new dataset of instructions to improve models' capability in zero-shot AUTHOR in identifying hyperpartisan news, inspired by datasets used for false information detection, such as Truthful-QA AUTHOR. Indeed, this dataset could be used to fine-tune generative models to enhance their performance. Additionally, we plan to explore more sophisticated prompting techniques in zero-shot and few-shot settings like prompt tuning in the political domain AUTHOR. Finally, we would like to investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and implement neuro-symbolic strategies, to incorporate retrieved documents or knowledge bases into the process. By pursuing these research directions, we aim to develop more effective and reliable systems for detecting hyperpartisan news and promoting media literacy.

The costs of inference and, in particular, training are extremely large, both in terms of time and computational resources, and they become prohibitive when working in dynamic environments, where data and tasks are progressively provided over time. The model must be able to adapt to new knowledge, new domains, new settings, without forgetting the previously learned skills. Retraining from scratch easily becomes too costly, thus Continual Learning strategies are of crucial importance. This is even more evident when data consist of ``long'' documents, that require several resources to be processed by modern neural models, leading to very long prompts. This paper investigates LLM-based Task-Incremental Learning in the case of tasks exploiting long sequences of text, as it is typical in summarization, question-answering on long documents, reviewing long contracts, and several others. We show how adapting the model by Task Arithmetic with LoRA, which was proposed for visual data, yields promising results also in the case of such ``long'' text data. To our best knowledge, this is the first work along this challenging direction. The outcome of the investigation of this paper is generic enough to represent an important starting point for further research in processing linguistic data in every language.","The quality of Language Models (LMs) has been rapidly improving in the last decade, showing outstanding skills when scaled to large data and networks AUTHOR, leading to the nowadays popular Large Language Models (LLMs). Solving more complex tasks with LLMs often requires processing ``long'' documents and articulated long instructions. However, handling lengthy prompts can be a significant obstacle for real-world applications, raising costs and resources required during both inference and, in particular, training. This issue can become critical when the LLM needs to be specialized to many different tasks, domains, and, more generally, when it is applied to dynamic settings that require multiple adaptations. For instance, in real-world applications, models need to be re-trained from time to time, as new data/tasks become available. In such scenarios, the need for Continual Learning (CL) AUTHOR strategies becomes imperative. From a very generic perspective, CL focuses on the development of algorithms capable of sequentially learning from a stream of data, while preserving what was learnt in past experiences, avoiding catastrophic forgetting AUTHOR. %Integrating both the handling of long texts and the development of multi-task models into a CL framework adds another layer of complexity to an already challenging landscape. In this work, motivated by the aforementioned issues, we study the problem of Continual Learning from ``long'' sequences of text, exploiting LLMs. We investigate several strategies based on LoRA AUTHOR to adapt an LLM to multiple tasks that are sequentially proposed over time. In particular, we first follow the route of training a single adapter in a sequential manner, then we explore Task Arithmetic to fuse multiple adapters trained independently AUTHOR. We consider the possibility of assigning different weights to each task, and we shed some light on what are the factors that contribute the most to catastrophic forgetting and to effective task adaptation. The outcomes of such an investigation reveals that: (1) there is limited sensitivity to task-order, i.e., regardless of the sequence in which tasks are presented, the overall average performance remains relatively stable, a property that, to our best knowledge, was never evaluated in the case of tasks composed of long documents; (2) despite its simplicity, Task Arithmetic demonstrates effectiveness in addressing forgetting phenomena when learning from long texts, %, and a very small fine-tuning on few examples from all the tasks, collected in a memory buffer, greatly improves the overall results, strongly reducing the gap from multiple models independently adapted to the task data. Moreover, (3) we are the first to evaluate a recently proposed benchmark (SCROLLS AUTHOR) in a CL setting, offering reference results for further activity in processing long sequences of text. We remark that while our experiments are based on data in English language, the generic issues we explore about handling long sequences of text are intrinsically shared by every language. %Influence of Output Style on Performance: We observed a notable influence of output style on performance outcomes, as illustrated by the comparison between Natural Language Inference and Summarization tasks. The distinct stylistic requirements of these tasks have a discernible effect on performance metrics, highlighting the importance of considering output style in task evaluation and analysis. %may be glued with introduction In the last few years, a variety of approaches were proposed by the scientific community in the context of CL (see AUTHOR and references therein). The main goal is the one of learning from newly provided information, with models that are capable of acquiring new knowledge without forgetting the previously learned one, and, more importantly, without storing the full dataset and retraining from scratch every time AUTHOR. Several efforts are dedicated to the case of lifelong Reinforcement Learning AUTHOR and of Supervised Learning AUTHOR, distinguishing among scenarios and categories of approaches AUTHOR, ranging from parameter isolation, regularization methods, and replays AUTHOR. Unsupervised or Self-Supervised Learning approaches are also becoming popular AUTHOR, and the case of adaptation of pre-trained backbones AUTHOR. Of course, neural models for processing language are a subject of study in the context of CL AUTHOR. We mention the case of language modeling in Lamol AUTHOR, which is trained to concurrently solve a task and mimic training examples, thereby preserving the distribution of previous tasks. Sun et al. AUTHOR introduce Distill and Replay, %which is trained on a sequence of tasks similarly to the approach applied in Lamol. It which learns to solve the task, to generate training examples formatted as context-question-answer, and to distill knowledge from a model trained on the previous task(s). %Before fitting the model to the next task, pseudo samples are generated to represent the data distribution of previous tasks. Differently, Reasoning-augmented Continual Learning AUTHOR focuses on creating reasoning pathways to preserve and improve LLMs’ reasoning abilities and information transfer. %Meaning that the LLM must provide the textual reasoning followed to compute the answer along with the answer itself. Surprisingly, it offers performance comparable to replay-based techniques. Together with works that learn new models from scratch, several approaches devise fine-tuning strategies for pre-trained Transformers in language processing, that turn out to be efficiently adaptable to a downstream task by learning only a small number of task-specific parameters. It is the case of models that tune the input prompt AUTHOR or of generic Adapters AUTHOR, such as the popular LoRA AUTHOR, which introduces new weight matrices, parametrized by the product of low-rank ones. Evaluating these models with long contexts AUTHOR is not frequent in the scientific literature, especially in the case in which multiple fine-tunings are sequentially applied, typical of CL, which is the main focus of this paper. In particular, LoRA and Task Arithmetic AUTHOR has been jointly studied to handle CL problems in vision AUTHOR, that is what this paper extends to the case of language and long sequences. We also mention works that focus instruction-based model for CL, such as ConTinTin AUTHOR, where each task is modelled by a specific instruction that directly defines the target concept along with a few instances that illustrate. %The authors start from NATURAL INSTRUCTIONS benchmark AUTHOR, whose instructions consist of 7 fields: Title, Definition, Caution, Prompt, Things to avoid and Examples, and they restructure the datasets in it in order to process them as a stream of tasks. Briefly, the system is required to perform a new task, generating its expected outputs, from its instruction, transfer the knowledge acquired from old tasks to help solve the new ones and simultaneously improve the performance on the upstream tasks. Scialom et al. AUTHOR and Luo et al. AUTHOR investigate natural language instructions paired with memory buffers and replays. %Remarkably, this approach allows to maintain almost 100% of the initial performance and turns out to be task order invariant, even though storing a buffer of data is still recognized as one of the limitations. Furthermore, their study concludes to exclude that CL adaptability actually emerges from the scale of the model, but rather from an intensive pre-training stage. To state it, they evaluate their model, CT0, not only on new and old tasks, but also on new instructions generated through instruction composition. In this scenario, they evaluate zero-shot performance and CT0 seems to succed in understanding instructions beyond those it was exposed to during training.","We investigated Large Language Models in progressively learning from tasks involving long sequences of text. A pre-trained model was paired with one or more adapters (LoRA), and we analyzed the role of Task Arithmetic, showing that it yields performances that are not far from the ones of multiple models independently trained to solve each task. Our results suggests a viable road to mitigate the need of large computational resources when learning from tasks based on ``long'' documents. While we exploited data in English language, the experiences of this paper can be interpreted as generic attempts to leverage long sequences in Continual Learning, in a sense going beyond the language barrier.

The experiment is part of a project aiming to build up an automated emoji-based pivot language providing an interlingua as a tool for linguistic simplification, accessibility, and international communication: Emojilingo URL. The present test involves human (Emojitaliano) and machine (Chat-GPT) translations in a comparative analysis in order to devise an automated integrated model highlighting emojis' expressive ability in transferring senses, clarifying semantic obscurities and ambiguities, and simplifying language. A first evaluation highlights Chat-GPT's ability to deal with a classic archaic literary vocabulary, also raising issues on managing criteria for better grasping the meanings and forms and about the multicultural extent of content transfer.","Consisting today in 3,782 icons, regularly updated by Unicode Consortium, URL the emoji international catalogue contains signs for \emoji{grinning-face} facial expressions, \emoji{person-shrugging} human gestures, \emoji{person-cartwheeling} people activities, \emoji{cook} jobs, \emoji{potted-plant} plants, \emoji{squid} animals, \emoji{spaghetti} food, \emoji{light-bulb} objects, \emoji{train} symbols of travel, \emoji{tokyo-tower} places, \emoji{rainbow-flag} flags, \emoji{input-numbers} numbers, and \emoji{red-square} geometrical forms. While the visual content seems to be able to provide an encyclopedic list with universal significance, ideally capable of conveying language-independent meanings, the interpretation of emojis is, on the contrary, highly arbitrary. They are strongly subject to ambiguities and variations due to linguistic, cultural, and personal specificities. The use of emoji has considerably increased over time, and besides complementing written texts in online messages and posts as a nice means to express feelings and emotional statuses, emojis are also used to completely replace verbal language statements AUTHOR. Experiments have been carried out to explore the feasibility of using emojis as language to convey meanings through emoji-only translations. Notable examples include the popular Emoji Dick project, the translation into emoji of Moby Dick AHUTOR, or Wonderland AHUTOR, an emoji poster created in 2014 to reproduce the full story of Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland. These earliest experiments, however, lack codification and, as such, cannot be considered as a language, that is, a shared system in the Saussurean sense AHUTOR. The first translation, in fact, was crowdsourced in a free and creative way, while the second one was an individual and literal translation experiment from English. A concrete attempt to create a truly codified emoji language can be represented by Emojitaliano AHUTOR. Emojitaliano is an emoji code originated from a crowdsourcing experiment initiated by a social community, specifically created to share a common emoji language able to counteract the natural polysemy of emojis. Born with the translation of Collodi’s Pinocchio, The Story of a Puppet AHUTOR, the structure and glossary of Emojitaliano have been afterwards usefully reapplied for the translation of texts of different genres such as the technical declaratory prose of the Italian Constitution , the Manifesto of non-hostile communication, the narrative prose of classic moral tales (i.e., The Wolf and the Lamb, in figure pecora, Giacomo Leopardi’s lyrical poem L’infinito. Emojitaliano is based on the assessment of conventional meanings and syntax, capable of guaranteeing the sharing of sense by means of intersemiotic translation, beyond subjective interpretations. Emojitaliano provides a grammatical structure and a shared vocabulary which can be expanded and re-shared with each new translation AHUTOR. Recent experiments have opened new research horizons in evaluating the capability of large language models (LLMs) to translate words or text into emojis. This is predicated on the assumption that, given LLMs are trained on extensive corpora sourced from the internet, they have been exposed to emojis and are able to grasp the semantics of emojis AHUTOR. Recently, Text2Emoji AHUTOR was proposed as an automatic translator, based on a large text-emoji parallel corpus, created by prompting the LLM, Chat-GPT (OpenAI, 2023) and EmojiLM, a sequence-to-sequence model specialised in the text-emoji bidirectional translation. Another translation experiment involving emojis, conducted by AHUTOR is Emojinize. This experiment leverages the power of LLMs to translate text by considering both prior and subsequent contexts, which differs from next-token prediction. Emojinize disambiguates synonyms based on context, unlike a static lookup table, and harnesses the expressive power of combining multiple emojis. Among the experiments, a first attempt using Chat-GPT to learn the Emojitaliano grammar was also carried out in 2023 by the Emojitaliano research group. Assuming the fundamental role of a conventional syntax as a basis for each shared code AHUTOR, the aim was to verify the ability of LLMs to learn and reapply the Emojitaliano grammar rules to produce translations of Pinocchio on its own AHUTOR. In this paper we present a follow-up experiment of automatic translation into emoji, focused on special vocabulary. Chat-GPT's translations of an authorial lexicon have been tested and then compared to the corresponding human solutions.The purpose is to test LLMs capabilities in autonomously rendering complex vocabulary, in the horizon of building a translation tool into emoji as a means of language simplification: the general project and the conlang itself are named Emojilingo and available online on URL. The paper is organised as follows: section 2 introduces the Emojilingo project Parole di Dante, the subject being translations in emoji of 365 words (Parole di Dante) from Dante’s poem Divine Comedy. Section 3 presents the AI translation experiment carried out with two versions of Chat-GPT (3.5 and 4) AHUTOR on the 365 Dante's words, with a focus on the method and descriptions of some examples. Section 4 provides an evaluation of the results, also obtained through AI models and through a similarity matrix, and the closing section includes conclusions and ideas on future work.","In this paper we presented a translation experiment into emojis using two versions of Chat-GPT, to compare them with a human version, already available, realized within the framework of the Emojitaliano experience. The present project focuses on an integrated translation program, that combines both human (Emojitaliano) and automated approaches, as a basis for a constructed emoji-based pivot language: Emojilingo. Using a zero-shot prompting approach, both Chat-GPT versions (3.5 and 4) provided emoji translations for 365 words extracted from Dante's Comedy, along with explanations for the their own translation solutions. We also had Chat-GPT evaluate the three different translations produced within the Emojitaliano project, alongside those produced by Chat-GPT. The present experiment substantially succeeds in confirming AI easiness and ability to use emojis to convey linguistic meanings, also managing special and archaic vocabulary. We in fact tested the machine's ability to handle denotative and connotative issues in the different translation choices, i.e. the translation solutions can be multi-faceted, each one catching some of the many semantic features underlying words. In this sense most solutions may be acceptable, such as to demonstrate the versatility of the emoji code to convey the senses. Within this broad faculty of choice, however, some options seem quite critical, due to the dissimilarity of cultural values expressed by the languages, and by the emojis themselves. That is, a main consequence of using AI for translation, also in emojis, is the reaffirmation of the crucial challenge in international translation: the need for careful attention to specific cultural dimensions during localization AUTHOR. Cultural values underlie texts, words and languages, as, for example, a `pig' is an `occidental' symbol for negative concepts as `dirt' and `gluttony' (as in `lurco'), while the animal has a totemic or sacred value elsewhere; likewise, colors, or gestures, take on cultural values according to societies and cannot be accorded univocal international meanings. The choice of an icon as and international multilingual sign cannot override cultural peculiarities. Finally, cultural vocabularies may vary on the basis of literary contexts and textual genres, often conveying suggestions related to signifiers that are now lost. Given the conservative structure of poetical language, emoji translations may therefore need to move beyond the broadness of interlingua to fully convey meanings by reproducing linguistic signs `verbatim' (es. `intuarsi' \emoji{person-standing}\emoji{magic-wand}\emoji{backhand-index-pointing-up}): that is, the literal solution, usually ruled out from the perspective of an international semantic code, becomes substantial to recover the cultural dimension of a literary text AUTHOR. Special care is therefore required in selecting corresponding matches in emoji so that they do not conflict with reception in different countries and societies and so that they do succeed in reaching the core content of the original, which is the main purpose of `the emojilingua'. future research will always need a human evaluation of automated outcomes, carried on by a team with extensive expertise in cross-cultural perspectives, and with a deep understanding of cultural values of emojis. This will help to limit unrestricted creativity and ensure a wide common comprehension of Emojilingo, and its highest exportability.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We focus on both technical documents (e.g., describing civil engineering works) and regulatory documents (e.g., describing procedures). While civil engineering documents contain crucial information that supports critical decision-making in construction, transportation and infrastructure projects, procedural documents outline essential guidelines and protocols that ensure efficient operations, adherence to safety standards and effective incident management. Although LLMs offer a promising solution for automating the extraction and comprehension of high-complexity documents, potentially transforming our interaction with technical information, LLMs may encounter significant challenges when processing such documents due to their complex structure, specialized terminology and strong reliance on graphical and visual elements. Moreover, LLMs are known to sometimes produce unexpected or incorrect analyses, a phenomenon referred to as hallucination. The goal of the paper is to conduct an assessment of LLM capacities along several dimensions, including the format of the document (i.e., selectable text PDFs versus scanned OCR PDFs), the structure of the documents (e.g., number of pages, date of the document), the graphical elements (e.g., tables, graphs, photos), the interpretation of text portions (e.g., make a summary), and the need of external knowledge (e.g., to interpret a mathematical expressions). To run the assessment, we took advantage of GPT-4omni, a large multi-modal model pre-trained on a variety of different data. Our findings suggest that there is great potential for real-world applications for high-complexity documents, although LLMs may still be susceptible to produce misleading information.","Technical documents employed in civil engineering contain information essential for planning, designing and constructing structures that need to ensure safety and compliance with regulations. As an example, such high-complexity documents provide technical guidelines for managing the development of roads, bridges and other transport networks. Additionally, these documents are fundamental for public infrastructure projects, ensuring they serve the community effectively and safely. These documents are highly complex, particularly due to their multi-modal nature, where textual content is mixed with several graphical content. The written content can vary from simple explanations to very detailed technical instructions, often referring to specialized regulations. The visual elements typically include tables with numbers, math formulas and detailed drawings of engineering stuff, as well as photos from natural environments and rendering of a construction once realized. In addition, documents are available either in PDF format as scanned documents, or as PDFs processed with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, introducing an additional layer of complexity due to potential variations in text recognition quality. Finally, civil engineering technical documents are typically long, easily reaching hundreds of pages. Figure~fig:figure shows one of the many visual elements occurring in the technical documents (civil engineering projects in Italian) considered in this study. [htbp] \centering \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/figure.png Similarly to technical documents, regulatory documents play an equally important role across the same sectors, as they outline the steps for managing incidents, supervising safety procedures and ensuring regulatory compliance. For example, railway procedural documents contain comprehensive instructions on handling incidents and supervising safety measures, introducing additional complexity through procedural frameworks. Although procedural documents lack the visual complexity typical of technical projects, such as the presence of figures, tables and graphs, they are dense with text, focusing on legal and procedural details. The paper investigates how state-of-the-art generative models are able to reason on the content of high-complexity technical and regulatory documents written in Italian. As generative models, both LLMs and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), are rapidly becoming more and more powerful, our research questions aim at assessing their ability to extract and interpret key information, this way reducing the need for manual reviews by human experts. To this end, we have defined a simple question-answer evaluation framework tailored to technical and regulatory documents. As an example, we ask the model questions such as Provide a general summary of the technical specifications in the document and then we manually check the model answer. We also consider the potential for LLMs/LMMs to generate content that is not grounded to the document, an issue often referred to as model confabulations or hallucinations AUTHOR. To assess confabulations we included ``trap"" questions mentioning non-existing objects in the document. Finally, the assessment considers both selectable text PDFs, which are extractable and editable, and scanned OCR PDFs, where text is derived from scanning or from OCR. A state-of-the-art survey on articles published between 2000 and 2021, focusing on the applications of Text Mining in the construction industry was presented in AUTHOR. AUTHOR and AUTHOR explored NLP application and development in construction. Various machine learning and deep learning-based NLP techniques, and their applications in construction research, are documented in AUTHOR. There are several potential real-world applications of LLMs in supporting and enhancing various sectors. Construction firms can exploit LLMs to assist in reviewing technical documents for safety regulations and building codes, helping simplifying compliance checks. Additionally, organizations with large document archives can leverage LLMs to identify potential inconsistencies or conflicts in procedures, providing valuable insights for further human review and ensuring adherence to unified operational protocols.","We showed that GPT-4omni has a high potential for analyzing technical and regulatory documents. However, the model tends to make factual errors, to generate inaccurate details and to provide misleading answers supported by technical explanations. These observations highlight potential limitations when handling long and complex documents, and further research is needed to better understand and address these challenges. Our study has some limitations that should be considered. Limited Sample Size. The evaluation was based on a dataset of four documents, which may not be representative of the broader range of technical documents. Query Format. We employed a multi-question prompt format, grouping multiple questions within a single prompt. We plan to explore an approach where each question is presented as an individual prompt. Examining Positional Bias. There is a possibility that the answer location within the document (beginning, middle, or end) might affect the model's performance. Contextual Sensitivity Analysis. The amount of context provided could influence GPT in answering questions related to specific document elements. We plan to systematically compare the model accuracy when presented with the entire document versus just the relevant page containing the answer. Playground vs. API Analysis. We primarily used the OpenAI API for evaluation. It would be valuable to explore whether analyzing documents through OpenAI's Playground interface yields similar results.",20,In-domain IR and IE

We exploit curated synthetic data on a large scale -- several Blackbird Language Matrices (BLMs) problems in Italian -- and use them to study how sentence representations built using pre-trained language models encode specific syntactic and semantic information. We use a two-level architecture to model separately a compression of the sentence embeddings into a representation that contains relevant information for a task, and a BLM task. We then investigate whether we can obtain compressed sentence representations that encode syntactic and semantic information relevant to several BLM tasks. While we expected that the sentence structure -- in terms of sequence of phrases/chunks -- and chunk properties could be shared across tasks, performance and error analysis show that the clues for the different tasks are encoded in different manners in the sentence embeddings, suggesting that abstract linguistic notions such as constituents or thematic roles does not seem to be present in the pretrained sentence embeddings.","Driven by increasing computational scale and progress in deep learning techniques, NLP models can rival human capabilities on established benchmarks. New benchmarks, then, that capture deeper levels of language understanding must be created and analysed AUTHOR. Blackbird's Language Matrices (BLM) AUTHOR is a recent task inspired by visual tests of analytic intelligence (Raven Progressive Matrices/RPMs, AUTHOR). The BLM tasks have cast light on whether the correct predictions in previously studied linguistic problems, e.g. number agreement or verb alternations, stem from sentence embeddings that encode deeper linguistic information, such as syntactic structure and semantic properties of phrases AUTHOR. We found that higher-level information -- syntactic structure and argument structure -- can be assembled from the information encoded in the sentence embeddings. This, however, may not be due to a deeper understanding of such information encoded by LLMs, but rather because of useful surface indicators AUTHOR. In this paper, we adopt BLMs to investigate whether current pretrained models encode abstract linguistic notions, such as constituents, and are able to do so in a manner that comprises both functional elements, such as pronouns, demonstratives and lexical elements, such as nominal constituents. We concentrate on Italian, and study several grammatical problems whose solutions can theoretically help each other, in a multi-task setting. We adopt a two-level architecture developed specifically to model what we know about how humans solve puzzles similar to BLMsAUTHOR. Level 1 aims to obtain compressed sentence representations that capture information about constituents and their properties; level 2 uses the compressed sentence representations to solve a BLM problem. This architecture provides a tool to study how LLMs encode different types of syntactic and semantic information.We make two contributions: (i) an initial core BLM dataset for Italian that covers linguistic problems of different nature; (ii) single and multi-task experiments that provide new insights into the information encoded by LLMs. The datasets are available at URL and the code at URL.","In this paper, we have presented curated synthetic datasets of Italian on two linguistic phenomena of an heterogeneous nature, such as agreement and verbal transitive/intransitive alternation, embedded in the BLM task. The results on the performance and the error analysis of a tailored two-level architecture have shown that multi-task environments do not help, or help only marginally in high-performance settings, suggesting that abstract linguistic notions, such as constituents or thematic roles do not seem to be present in the learning process. Current work is developing new analyses and architectures to probe further in the encoding of information in sentence embeddings and creating new BLM problems across various languages and linguistic phenomena.",1,Language Models

We take the approach of developing curated synthetic data on a large scale, with specific properties, and using them to study sentence representations built using pretrained language models. We use a new multiple-choice task and datasets, Blackbird Language Matrices (BLMs), to focus on a specific grammatical structural phenomenon -- subject-verb agreement across a variety of sentence structures -- in several languages. Finding a solution to this task requires a system detecting complex linguistic patterns and paradigms in text representations. Using a two-level architecture that solves the problem in two steps -- detect syntactic objects and their properties in individual sentences, and find patterns across an input sequence of sentences -- we show that despite having been trained on multilingual texts in a consistent manner, multilingual pretrained language models have language-specific differences, and syntactic structure is not shared, even across closely related languages.","Large language models, trained on huge amount of texts, have reached a level of performance that rivals human capabilities on a range of established benchmarks AUTHOR. Despite high performance on high-level language processing tasks, it is not yet clear what kind of information these language models encode, and how. For example, transformer-based pretrained models have shown excellent performance in tasks that seem to require that the model encodes syntactic information AUTHOR. All the knowledge that the LLMs encode comes from unstructured texts and the shallow regularities they are very good at detecting, and which they are able to leverage into information that correlates to higher structures in language. Most notably, AUTHOR have shown that from the unstructured textual input, BERT AUTHOR is able to infer POS, structural, entity-related, syntactic and semantic information at successively higher layers of the architecture, mirroring the classical NLP pipeline AUTHOR. We ask: How is this information encoded in the output layer of the model, i.e. the embeddings? Does it rely on surface information -- such as inflections, function words -- and is assembled on the demands of the task/probes AUTHOR, or does it indeed reflect something deeper that the language model has assembled through the progressive transformation of the input through its many layers? To investigate this question, we use a seemingly simple task -- subject-verb agreement. Subject-verb agreement is often used to test the syntactic abilities of deep neural networks AUTHOR, because, while apparently simple and linear, it is in fact structurally, and theoretically, complex, and requires connecting the subject and the verb across arbitrarily long or complex structural distance. It has an added useful dimension -- it relies on syntactic structure and grammatical number information that many languages share. In previous work we have shown that simple structural information -- the chunk structure of a sentence -- which can be leveraged to determine subject-verb agreement, or to contribute towards more semantic tasks, can be detected in the sentence embeddings obtained from a pre-trained model AUTHOR. This result, though, does not cast light on whether the discovered structure is deeper and more abstract, or it is rather just a reflection of surface indicators, such as function words or morphological markers. To tease apart these two options, we set up an experiment covering four languages: English, French, Italian and Romanian. These languages, while different, have shared properties that make sharing of syntactic structure a reasonable expectation, if the pretrained multilingual model does indeed discover and encode syntactic structure. We use parallel datasets in the four languages, built by (approximately) translating the BLM-AgrF dataset AUTHOR, a multiple-choice linguistic test inspired from the Raven Progressive Matrices visual intelligence test, previously used to explore subject-verb agreement in French. Our work offers two contributions: (i) four parallel datasets -- on English, French, Italian and Romanian, focused on subject-verb agreement; (ii) cross-lingual and multilingual testing of a multilingual pretrained model, to explore the degree to which syntactic structure information is shared across different languages. Our cross-lingual and multilingual experiments show poor transfer across languages, even those most related, like Italian and French. This result indicates that pretrained models encode syntactic information based on shallow and language-specific clues, from which they are not yet able to take the step towards abstracting grammatical structure. The datasets are available at and the code at .","We have aimed to add some evidence to the question How do state-of-the-art systems \llknow\gg what they \llknow\gg? AUTHOR by projecting the subject-verb agreement problem in a multilingual space. We chose languages that share syntactic structures, and have particular differences that can provide clues about whether the models learned rely on shallower indicators, or the pretrained models encode deeper knowledge. Our experiments show that pretrained language models do not encode abstract syntactic structures, but rather this information is assembled ""upon request"" -- by the probe or task -- based on language-specific indicators. %PGM This is too strong, it might be that the chunk information is in middle levels and it gets merged with other types of info before getting to the output. In fact, I bet that is what is going on. Understanding how information is encoded in large language models can help determine the next necessary step towards making language models truly deep. \paragraph{Acknowledgments We gratefully acknowledge the partial support of this work by the Swiss National Science Foundation, through grant SNF Advanced grant TMAG-1\_209426 to PM. \onecolumn \appendix",1,Language Models

After describing the principles of the Linked Data paradigm, on which LiITA is grounded, the paper presents the lemma-centred architecture of the Knowledge Base and details its core component, consisting of a large collection of Italian lemmas (called the Lemma Bank) used to interlink distributed lexical and textual resources.","When considering the number of digital linguistic resources, either lexical or textual, Italian is among the richest languages: e.g., at the time of writing, a search on the CLARIN Virtual Language Observatory,} filtered for the Italian language, returns more than \num{8000} results. Like other high-resource languages, Italian is provided with a large set of fundamental resources, including WordNets ( AUTHOR and AUTHOR), a few treebanks available from the Universal Dependencies collection}, historical corpora }} and reference corpora of written (e.g., CORIS/CODIS AUTHOR) and spoken language (e.g., KIParla AUTHOR). However, as is the case for many other languages, most linguistic resources for Italian vary in terms of data format, annotation criteria, and/or adopted tagsets. Such variation hinders full interaction between the (meta)data provided by the many available resources, with a negative impact on the empirical study of the language and resource usability. Indeed, different resources may provide different information or use different granularity of information about the same common object, namely words, which appear as occurrences in corpora and as entries in dictionaries or lexicons. Making this wealth of information interact represents one of today's main challenges, to best leverage the huge asset of (meta)data collected over decades of work. As a consequence, a very active line of research currently focuses on the so-called Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD), aiming to define common practices for the representation and publication of linguistic resources according to the principles of the Linked Data paradigm, which underpins the Semantic Web), the ItalWordNet v.2 (), and a collection of names from the PAROLE SIMPLE CLIPS (PSC) lexicon ().}. A recently concluded COST Action (Nexus Linguarum}) resulted both in the creation of a large and cohesive scientific community and in the definition of a set of shared vocabularies for linguistic knowledge description. Some of these vocabularies have been widely applied in the LiLa Knowledge Base (KB), which is probably the main LLOD use case currently available. LiLa (Linking Latin) is a KB of Latin linguistic resources made interoperable through their representation and publication according to the Linked Data principles. Thanks to its streamlined and language-independent architecture, LiLa is today a reference model for projects aiming to achieve online interoperability between distributed linguistic resources. Building on the experience of LiLa and reusing its architecture, the LiITA (Linking Italian){http://www.liita.it/}} project has started the creation of a KB of interoperable linguistic resources for Italian published as Linked Data. This paper describes the development of the fundamental component of the LiITA KB, which consists of a collection of Italian lemmas (called the Lemma Bank) that serves as the connection point between word occurrences and their entries in the corpora and lexical resources that will be published in the KB.","In this paper we presented the first steps towards the publication as LLOD of a collection of canonical forms of citation (lemmas) for Italian. Such Lemma Bank is the core component of LiITA, a knowledge base of interoperable linguistic resources for Italian inspired by the LiLa knowledge base for Latin. LiITA aims to compensate the current lack of interoperability between Italian resources, as well as to become the pivot to interlink all the present and future lexicons and corpora for Italian. To this aim, the Lemma Bank is modelled such that it can harmonise different lemmatisation criteria found in lexical and textual resources, following a bottom-up approach rather that a top-down one. Building a Lemma Bank to make distributed resources interoperable in Linked Data is an open-ended process. As the linking of more and more resources to the KB might require the inclusion of new lemmas, the LiITA Lemma Bank will keep on growing, both through the extraction of lemmas from other lexical sources and in a resource-driven fashion. Beside extending the Lemma Bank and linking the first resources, the LiITA project will develop online services, following what has been done for LiLa AUTHOR. The process of linking a text or corpus in the KB must be supported by an accessible tool performing automatic lemmatisation, PoS-tagging and linking. Currently, a new Stanza model AUTHOR has been trained combining all the existing Italian treebanks. This model will serve as the foundation for the linkage process of textual resources to be included in the LiITA KB. in Appendix. The model can be found at \href{https://github.com/LiITA-LOD/LiITA_NLP_Models}{https://github.com/LiITA-LOD/LiITA_NLP_Models} The advanced interrogation of data offered by all the resources interlinked in LiITA will be eased by a graphical interface which will help with the task of writing complex SPARQL queries.

A vector space anisotropy inspection has also been performed, as a potential source of the experimental results. The analysis reveals that the embedding spaces of two out of the three analyzed models exhibit poor anisotropy, while the third model shows relatively moderate anisotropy compared to previous findings for models with similar architecture AUTHOR. These findings offer new insights into the relationship between generation quality and vector representations in decoder-only LLMs.","Lexical ambiguity (LA) is a peculiar characteristics of human language communication. Words often carry multiple meanings, and discerning the intended sense requires nuanced comprehension of contextual cues. LA is a broad concept subsuming several semantic phenomena, such as regular and irregular polysemy, homonymy, and the coinage of new senses. Humans handle such ambiguity effortlessly, leveraging contextual information, prior knowledge, and pragmatic inference. However, for Large Language Models (LLMs), which rely on statistical patterns in text data, accurately resolving lexical ambiguity remains a challenging task. Despite their remarkable capability of using words appropriately in context, one critical aspect that requires deeper investigation is whether such models possess human-like lexical competence, enabling them to generalize from multiple instances of the same phenomenon, or if they are simply mimicking these instances. In this paper, we aim to investigate how LLMs handle LA. Specifically, we challenged three decoder-only instruction-tuned models to generate lexical similarity ratings for word pairs used in two different contexts, with various degrees of sense similarity. To achieve this, we employed a chain-of-thought approach, prompting the models to produce a step-by-step reasoning process before assigning their ratings, allowing them to better distinguish between different senses of the same term. For this task, we used the dataset released by \citet{haber2021patterns}, which includes human similarity judgments. The models' generated ratings were correlated with human similarity judgments to determine whether their lexical disambiguation competence aligns with that of humans. Additionally, we computed the cosine similarity between the models' internal representation of the ambiguous target words. Our research question is twofold: i.) to assess if the models' generated ratings are consistent with their internal representations of the target words; ii.) to determine whether the internal representations have a more similar distribution to human ratings than the generated responses. We are aware that context-sensitive word embeddings, like those of LLMs, can suffer from a representation degeneration problem (see Section sec:anisotropy for further details), which limits their semantic representational power. Hence, we included in our analysis a brief overview of how this phenomenon affects the internal representational space of the models under our investigation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which different decoder-only models were tested on their metalinguistic competence regarding LA. Understanding how LLMs manage this type of complex semantic phenomenon, based on the interplay of multiple contextual factors, can guide new improvements in training methodologies for the development of more sophisticated and robust models that better mimic human-like language understanding. %\item Analyzing the capability of decoder-only LLMs to capture LA via prompting, in comparison to annotators' similarity judgments; %\item Comparing the cosine similarity scores among target words with annotators' similarity judgments, to establish the correlation between hidden states and human ratings; %\item Assessing the internal coherence of the tested LLMs by comparing their generated predictions with the cosine distances between vector representations of target words. %\item %Investigating the effects of anisotropy in decoder-only models, revealing interesting and unusual findings compared to previous studies AUTHOR.","%Fatte Our study investigates how LLMs handle LA, using two distinct methodologies: Eliciting rating scores from the model and analyzing the cosine similarity between pairs of polysemous words. We calculated the Spearman correlation between HRS vs. MRS, HRS vs. CSS, and MRS vs. CSS. The aim was to determine whether the model's metalinguistic knowledge aligns with its internal representations and to assess if human ratings more closely match the outputs generated by the model than its internal representations. The lack of correlation between CSS and MRS provides intriguing insights into the relationship between the internal representations of LLMs and the responses they generate in metalinguistics tasks, like explicitly assigning similarity ratings. Specifically, the argument presented in AUTHOR appears to be validated: Generated responses do not always reflect the model's internal processing. AUTHOR compared model generations with their probability distributions and found the latter method to be more accurate. In contrast, in our study, using the internal representations of the model (i.e., the contextual embeddings, \luca{as motivated in Section sec:relworks}) proved to be a less reliable method. The most straightforward conclusion is that generative LLMs might be suboptimal for estimating word sense similarity. The superior performance of probability estimation reported by AUTHOR might be due to its direct link to the prediction training objectives of LLMs. To further investigate the relationship between CSS and MRS, we inspected the anisotropy of the embeddings. The average cosine similarity among a sample of generated tokens was relatively low, indicating that anisotropy did not affect our cosine similarity measures and is not characteristic of all decoder-only models under investigation. The lack of anisotropy observed in some of the analyzed decoder-only models is at odds with the conclusions of AUTHOR, who reported a higher anisotropic space for GPT-2. % Only MRS yielded a moderate correlation with HRS, indicating that LA is not fully captured by the analyzed models, in text generation and vector representations. In conclusion, the relationship between human judgments, model generations, and internal representations appears unclear and calls for further research. Despite the low anisotropy of the examined models, cosine similarity did not reveal a correlation between the generations and the internal representations of the models, indicating a need for deeper investigation. We plan to repeat the experiments by leveraging recent results with sparse autoencoders AUTHOR to decompose the meanings of lexically ambiguous words. This could provide a deeper understanding of the models' ability to handle and represent polysemy. %and to determine whether this limitation also affect their performance in a downstream task. scenarios where polysemy emerges from the whole context of a sentence. We could not extract embeddings from commercial models, such as those provided by OpenAI, which are accessible only through APIs. However, it would be valuable in future research, if and when this functionality becomes available, to analyze and compare the internal representations and the generated outputs of these state-of-the-art models. Another promising avenue for future research is to examine the differences between vector representations and generated tokens with respect to linguistic phenomena beyond polysemy and lexical ambiguity. For instance, incorporating out-of-vocabulary words could allow for an exploration of semantic shifts caused by the addition of prefixes or suffixes (e.g., ``order'' vs. ``dis-order''), offering valuable insights. This analysis would benefit from using a tokenization strategy that treats morphemes as subtokens, alongside an investigation into the degree of anisotropy in these models.

Comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, demonstrate the superiority of SLIMER-IT on never-seen-before entity tags.","Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a fundamental role in Natural Language Processing (NLP), often being a key component in information extraction pipelines. The task involves identifying and categorizing entities in a given text according to a predefined set of labels. While person, organization, and location are the most common, applications of NER in certain fields may require the identification of domain-specific entities. \centering \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{SLIMERIT_prompt.png and guidelines steer the model labelling. Manually annotated data has always been critical for the training of NER systems AUTHOR. Traditional methods tackle NER as a token classification problem, where models are specialized on a narrow domain and a pre-defined labels set AUTHOR. While achieving strong performance for the data distribution they were trained on, they require extensive human annotations relative to the downstream task at hand. Additionally, they lack generalization capabilities when it comes to addressing out-of-distribution input domains and/or unseen labels AUTHOR. On the contrary, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities. Models like GPT-3 can tackle NER via In-Context Learning AUTHOR, with Instruction-Tuning further improving performance AUTHOR. To this end, several models have been proposed to tackle zero-shot NER AUTHOR. In particular, SLIMER AUTHOR proved to be particularly effective on unseen named entity types, by leveraging definitions and guidelines to steer the model generation. However, little has been done for zero-shot NER in non-English data. More in general, as pointed out in AUTHOR, NER is understudied in languages like Italian, especially outside the traditional news domain and person, location, organization classes. To this end, we propose in this paper an evaluation framework for Zero-Shot NER, and we apply it to the Italian language. In addition, we fine-tune a version of SLIMER for Italian, which we call SLIMER-IT}. In the experiments, we explore different LLM backbones and we assess the impact of Definition and Guidelines (D\&G). When comparing SLIMER-IT with state-of-the-art approaches, either using models pre-trained on English or adapted for Italian, results demonstrate SLIMER-IT superiority in labelling unseen entity tags.","In this paper, we proposed an evaluation framework for Zero-Shot NER that we applied to Italian. Thanks to such a framework, we can better investigate different zero-shot properties depending on the scenario (in-domain, OOD, unseen NEs). On top of that, we compared several state-of-the-art approaches, with particular focus on SLIMER, which, thanks to the usage of definition and guidelines, is well suited to deal with novel entity types. Indeed, SLIMER-IT, our fine-tuned model based on LLaMAntino-3, surpasses other state-of-the-art techniques by large margins. In the future, we plan to further extend the zero-shot NER benchmark, and implement an input caching mechanism for scalability to large label sets. \clearpage",1,Language Models
632_2024,2024,81_paper,"Mariachiara Pascucci, Mirko Tavosanis",Confronto tra diversi tipi di valutazione del miglioramento della chiarezza di testi amministrativi in lingua italiana,ITA,2,1,1,Università di Pisa,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pisa,"The paper presents a comparison of different types of evaluation of administrative texts in the Italian language on which a Clarity improvement intervention was carried out. The Clarity Improvement was performed by human experts and ChatGPT. The evaluation was carried out in four different ways: by expert evaluators, used as a reference; by evaluators with good skills, subject to dedicated training; by generic evaluators recruited through a crowdsourcing platform; by ChatGPT. The results show that the closest match to the results of the evaluation by expert evaluators was achieved, by a wide margin, by evaluators with good skills and dedicated training; the second best approach was obtained by requesting evaluation from ChatGPT; the worst approach was achieved by generic evaluators recruited through a crowdsourcing platform. Task features that may have influenced the outcome are also discussed.","The spread of generative artificial intelligence systems has led to a large demand for evaluation of their capabilities. The type of assessment universally considered the most valid remains in general that made by human beings, but in practice it can be conducted in different ways and with very different results of value. Moreover, for some capacities there are still no shared scoreboards. There is no doubt that the latter category also includes an assessment of the overall improvement in the clarity of the texts in the Italian language, which is the subject of the analysis described here. The existing objective indices for the analysis of texts, such as GULPEASE or the quantification of the words included in the Basic Vocabulary, actually describe only limited aspects of any text. For clarity in itself, while the indications on how to write clearly abound (an updated summary is given in [1]), broad consensus criteria for product evaluation have never been codified [2]. Of course, many current evaluation methods provide at least a first orientation in most cases. For example, [3] has shown that through crowdsourcing it is possible to obtain a generic but reliable indication on the improvement of the clarity of English texts. However, studies on the effectiveness of such practices are still very few and there is no doubt a great need to improve the current level of knowledge. This contribution is part of this context as it compares different methods of assessing the improvement of the clarity of texts. The subject matter of the evaluation was rather broad texts, representative of the administrative Italian and made clearer through human intervention and reformulation with ChatGPT (version 3.5); the context, which saw the implementation of several related evaluation activities, is described in detail in [4]. For the purpose of this contribution, the evaluation was carried out in four different ways: by expert evaluators, used as reference; by well-trained evaluators, the subject of dedicated training; by generic evaluators recruited through a crowdsourcing platform; by ChatGPT. In all cases, the same set of assessment indications was used. The results were analysed in [4] for the information they provide regarding the ability of systems such as ChatGPT to effectively improve text clarity. More specifically, the difference in judgements in relation to the four methods of assessment will be shown here.","The results of the different valuation methods could at first glance be interpreted as a devaluation of crowdsourcing, compared to which the simple request to ChatGPT is able to deliver higher quality results. However, it is clear that the characteristics of the activity carried out make it advisable not to draw too general conclusions. First of all, it calls for caution that evaluation depends on the scale used. In a context where it is known that the vote can only be 4 or 5, at the end of the day, the simple random allocation of the score would give 4.5 to both Group A and Group B, moving away from the expert judgement with 0.26 for the overall assessment and 0.34 for aspects 1, 2 and 5, values very close to those provided by the trained evaluators. In these circumstances, it seems useful first of all to create more specific and targeted evaluation grids. The high performance of the current systems, moreover, certainly makes less useful than in the past scales 1-5 in which score 1 must be assigned to a completely incomprehensible text and score 5 to a perfectly understandable text. Certain limits of the analysis should also be taken into account. One of these is the involvement of the authors in the rewriting of some texts: even if the characteristics of the evaluation make in our opinion very limited the risk of alterations, it is expected to modify the protocol for future activities of the same kind, delegation all the rewritings to third parties. For the evaluation of ChatGPT-generated texts it may also be useful to have the texts evaluated by a different system and, in general, to extend and repeat the evaluations is of course necessary to validate the results. However, the results certainly call for attention to be paid to the limitations of today's widespread practices such as crowdsourcing, which on the task under consideration have shown a considerable deviation from the evaluation of experts. Moreover, if the rapid and economic evaluation provided by systems such as ChatGPT were to be regularly confirmed as closer to expert evaluation than crowdsourcing, the motivations for crowdsourcing itself would disappear.",11,Text Simplification

Yet earlier work suggests that this technique affects the performance of the model as it might include misleading information from previous text sequences during pre-training. To fill this gap, intra-context and rank-based causal masking techniques have been proposed, in which the probability of each token is conditional only on the previous ones in the same document or ranked sequences, avoiding misleading information from different contexts. However, the sequences provided by the use of these techniques have been little explored, overlooking the opportunity to optimise the composition by manipulating the volume and heterogeneity in the sequences and improving unbalance pre-training settings. In this paper, we demonstrate that organising text chunks based on a policy that aligns with text similarity effectively improve pre-training, enhances the learning and cross-lingual generalisation capabilities of language models, maintains efficiency, and allows for fewer instances. %Our code is publicly released at the following \href{https://github.com/lranaldii/pretraining-order}{link","Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained on huge amounts of documents by optimizing a language modelling objective and show an intriguing ability to solve various downstream NLP tasks. \citet{ranaldi-etal-2023-modeling} in multilingual settings and later \citet{zhao2024analysingimpactsequencecomposition} highlighted the importance of pre-training data quality, diversity and composition methodologies. Our research takes a step further by exploring the influence of the pre-training sequences heterogeneity for cross-lingual generalisation. This potentially leads to significant advancements in understanding LLMs' learning properties. [t] \includegraphics[width=0.96\linewidth]{figures/pipelines.pdf randomly samples documents from all corpora to construct pre-training sequences, which can pack documents from different sources; Sequence-based randomly samples documents from a single source to construct a sequence; Retrieve-based operate via ranking-based construction process. The down block represents a document Collector that caches a set of documents randomly sampled between the corpora. In decoder-only architectures pre-training, the constructions of the instances are based on packing that combines randomly sampled texts (i.e., documents) into a chunk that matches the size of the context window without using any selection policy. Then, the causal masking predicts the next token conditioned on the previous, including those from different documents (portions of non-contiguous texts) in the chunk. The ways to mitigate this arbitrary procedure are: (i) \intraMask AUTHOR, where the likelihood of each token is conditioned on the previous from the same document AUTHOR and retrieval-based masking AUTHOR where similar documents retrieved by retrieval systems condition likelihood. To study the role of heterogeneity and volume of samples in sequence composition strategies (i.e., packing and masking pipelines), we pre-train language models using different masking approaches (described in \S sec:masking) and compare them with models pre-trained via the traditional causal masking with different packing approaches by varying amount of the sequence composition of the documents in the pre-training chunks. Whilst for studying the impact on cross-lingual generalisation we use cross-lingual settings (i.e., Italian English). Complementing the foundation approaches proposed in AUTHOR,we operate via bilingual corpora. Hence, we analyse the results produced by a commonly used baseline method that randomly samples and packs documents (\MixChunk), a process that samples and packs documents from the same source based on their composition and origin (\UniChunk), and then operate via efficient retrieval-based packing method, which retrieves and packs related documents (\S sec:bm25chunk). The experimental results indicate that operating via causal masking (\MixChunk) with arbitrary sequence patterns of documents leads to the inclusion of misleading information that stems from different context during pre-training (\S sec:pretraining), impacting in a negatively the performance of the models in downstream tasks (\S sec:downstream_tasks). Instead, \intraMask, which avoids the misleading phenomena during pre-training, significantly improves the models' performance and does not impact the runtime. Although \intraMask performs well, it limits the operability of sequence composition mixing documents from different corpora (in our case in different languages as well). As revealed by \citet{zhao2024analysingimpactsequencecomposition} as well, this is partly solved by \UniChunk's avoidance of packing documents from different distributions, which improves the performance of causal masking models in downstream tasks but still does not allow individual sequences to be selected. Hence, we use a retrieval-based packing method, which allows operating directly on sequences by improving cross-lingual models' language modeling, in-context learning and generative capabilities by using causal masking and thus paying a small fee for document sorting but achieving tangible results. Our main findings can be summarised as follows: [leftmargin=*,noitemsep,nolistsep] \item By analyzing different pre-trained strategies in cross-lingual settings we reveal that operating through causal masking and considering the order and patterns sequence represented in documents, leads to significant improvements. In addition, retrieval-based techniques provide resilience and allow for the selection of pre-training sequences by guaranteeing heterogeneity and reducing data (\S sec:pretraining). \item We show important benefits on the in-context learning capabilities of downstream models. We observe that in low-resource settings, it is possible to achieve the same performance and in some cases cross-lingual generalisation (in our case, English-Italian) (\S sec:downstream_tasks). \item In conclusion, we show that the retrieval-based packing method allowing for a flexible sequence composition process benefits unbalanced cross-lingual learning tangible benefits by using less pre-training data.","The role of pre-training sampling is a strategic component. We analyse the impact of sequencing by pre-training several language models on multilingual corpora. We showed that causal masking involves misleading documents that confound the pre-training of language models and impact the performance in downstream tasks. Hence, we find that improving sequence correlation in pre-training chunks reduces potential distractions while improving the performance of language models without reducing pre-training efficiency. In the future, we will study whether these findings archive benefits in fine-tuning pipelines AUTHOR as well. \clearpage \appendix",1,Language Models

The advent of large-language models has raised intriguing questions about the presence of such conditions in LLMs AUTHOR. Our research investigates the phenomenon of SPLIT, in which the System Prompt, a seemingly innocuous input, profoundly impacts the linguistic outputs of LLMs. The findings of our study reveal a striking correlation between the System Prompt and the emergence of distinct, persona-like linguistic patterns in the LLM's responses. These patterns are not only reminiscent of the dissociative identities present in the original data but also exhibit a level of coherence and consistency that is uncommon in typical LLM outputs. As we continue to explore the capabilities of LLMs, it is imperative that we maintain a keen awareness of the potential for SPLIT and its significant implications for the development of more human-like and empathetic AI systems.","The thriving field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed a paradigm shift with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) AUTHOR. The availability of large, publicly-accessible datasets and the development of more effective training techniques, such as the popular transformer architecture, have been instrumental in the creation of these language models. LLMs are characterized by their model size, measured in the billions of parameters, and their ability to learn and improve upon the tasks of language understanding and generation through self-supervised learning on vast amounts of text data AUTHOR. This training process, often referred to as ""self-supervised learning,"" enables the models to learn the patterns and structures of a language in a more organic and efficient manner, as they are not limited by the need for human-labeled data. The applications of LLMs are diverse and rapidly expanding, with the potential to transform various areas and aspects of our lives. As an example, LLMs can be employed to develop chatbots that can understand and respond to a wide range of user inquiries with a high degree of accuracy or to generate human-like articles, stories, and even entire books, which can be a game-changer for content producers and publishers AUTHOR.\\ In the context of the Italian language, the development of LLMs has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with and learn from the Italian language, as well as the way we use technology to create and disseminate Italian content AUTHOR. However, alongside their undeniable potential lies a realm of intriguing phenomena yet to be fully explored. This groundbreaking study delves into a newly discovered facet of LLM behavior – System Prompt Induced Linguistic Transmutation (SPLIT). The cornerstone of LLM interaction is the System Prompt, a seemingly innocuous input that guides the model's response. We propose that this seemingly simple prompt can have a profound effect on the linguistic outputs of LLMs, potentially leading to a phenomenon we term SPLIT. This concept draws inspiration from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) AUTHOR, a complex mental health condition characterized by the presence of multiple distinct identities or personas within an individual.\\ The parallels between DID and SPLIT are striking same as naive. Just as a DID patient may exhibit distinct personalities in response to external stimuli AUTHOR, our research suggests that LLMs, under the influence of varying \textbf{System Prompts}, may generate outputs that reflect distinct, persona-like linguistic patterns. These patterns are not merely random deviations but exhibit a level of coherence and consistency rarely observed in typical LLM responses. The implications of SPLIT are far-reaching. As we strive to develop AI systems with greater human-like qualities, understanding and harnessing the potential of SPLIT could pave the way for the creation of more empathetic and nuanced AI interactions. Conversely, neglecting SPLIT's influence could lead to unintended consequences, potentially hindering the development of robust and reliable AI systems. Moreover, as in DID AUTHOR This study represents a first step in unraveling the complexities of SPLIT. By acknowledging its existence and delving deeper into its mechanisms, we can pave the way for a future where AI development is guided by both scientific rigor and an awareness of the potential for unforeseen consequences. Our research not only sheds light on a previously unknown aspect of LLM behavior but also compels us to re-evaluate our understanding of these sophisticated systems and their potential interaction with human-like mental states.","In this work, we provocatively observed the presence of pathologies related to dissociative identity disorder in large language models. We observed that by varying the system prompt through a SPLIT (System Prompt Induced Linguistic Transmutation) process the behavior of the same LLM varies widely. The induced identities show different independent and personal abilities, skills, styles and information. The possibility of a Large Language Model simulating or even exhibiting characteristics similar to those of a Dissociative Identity Disorder, raises important questions about the nature of consciousness, artificial intelligence, and the potential risks and challenges of creating highly advanced language processing systems. At the same time, we proposed three system prompts to mitigate the issue and prevent end users from exploiting this vulnerability to extract sensitive and dangerous data. On the contrary, the presence of this SPLIT-induced behaviour may lead to useful future studies to improve the performance of the model on specific tasks. For example, one might think of asking the model ‘What is the best character to interpret or to answer the next question?’. The result of this prompt would lead to the identification of a personality to be brought out before the generation of the answer to be given to the end user. Being able to bring out such personalities when needed could help create more empathetic, accurate and dynamic interactions. Nevertheless, this fascinating research direction needs future studies and solutions that operate at architectural level. The exploration of this idea serves as a catalyst for the development of more sophisticated and responsible AI systems, for a deeper understanding of human psychology and its complex manifestations in the digital age.",13,Multimodal

To this purpose, we developed a resource for the linguistic evaluation of BabyLMs, which are LMs trained on datasets that comparable to the linguistic stimulus received by children. This resource adapts four standardized tests for the evaluation of linguistic skills of Italian-speaking children (BVL, TROG-2, TCGB-2 and Peabody). To verify the effectiveness of our benchmark, we administered it to Minerva, a LLM pretrained from scratch on Italian. Our results indicate that Minerva struggles to master certain linguistic aspects, achieving an age-equivalent score of 4 years, and that the type of task administered affects the model's performance.","This paper presents BaBIEs (Baby Benchmark for Italian linguistic Evaluations), a new resource for the standardized evaluation of Italian BabyLMs, that is, language models (LMs) trained on datasets that are qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to the type of stimulus received by humans during language acquisition.

Finally, in Section conclusion, some conclusions and possible future research directions are outlined.","This paper presents BaBIEs, a novel resource specifically designed to evaluate the linguistic competence of BabyLMs and compare them to those of children. After having detailed the sources and the creation process of this resource, we provided the procedure for testing the Minerva model with the resource itself. Finally, we presented and discussed the results the model’s performance. Based on the presented findings, the resource appears a valuable tool for evaluating not only BabyLMs but LMs in general. The poor performance exhibited by Minerva underscores the gap between child language acquisition and current language model training. This highligths the necessity for modifying model training to better encode human language and, more generally, human linguistic competence. Future work will involve a more systematic linguistic analysis of the model's performance, together with a comprehensive error analysis and a comparison to adult Italian-speakers. Furthermore, it will involve the development of a multimodal version of the test, which will more closely reflect the original tests and allow the evaluation of multimodal BabyLMs. Additionally, a BabyLM trained exclusively with Italian child-directed speech will be developed and evaluated with both the standard and multimodal versions of the test.

While LLMs have made lexical analysis more implicit, explicit argument structure identification remains crucial in domain-specific contexts. The research leverages T-PAS, a rich lexical resource for Italian verbs, to fine-tune the open multilingual model Mistral 7B using the Iterative Reasoning Preference Optimization (IRPO) technique. This approach aims to enhance the recognition and extraction of verbal patterns from Italian sentences, addressing challenges in resource quality, coverage, and frame extraction methods. By combining curated lexical-semantic resources with neural language models, this work contributes to improving verb subcategorization tasks, particularly for the Italian language, and demonstrates the potential of LLMs in refining linguistic analysis tools.","Verb subcategorization is the task of identifying and classifying the syntactic patterns (or frames) taken by verbs in sentences. These patterns encode the possible combinations of arguments (such as subjects, objects, and complements) that a verb can have, specifying the number and type of arguments as well as their syntactic and semantic roles. Verb subcategorization is often used in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to provide the main interpretation backbone. Although recent developments brought about by Large Language Models (LLM) make lexical analysis somewhat implicit, there are cases in which the identification of the argument structure of the verb is required, especially those where extensive domain-specific knowledge is required. Semantic lexical resources such as VerbNet AUTHOR, FrameNet AUTHOR and PropBank AUTHOR have been largely employed for several NLP tasks in the past decades, including accomplishing verbal framing for the English language. VerbNet, for example, has been used to improve semantic role labeling, verb sense disambiguation and ontology mapping ( AUTHOR, AUTHOR); its new enhanced semantic representations have also recently been used for entity state tracking AUTHOR. The main problems addressed in these experiences concern the quality and coverage of such resources and the methods used to extract frames from sentences. Neural Language Models can help address both these issues. On the one hand, they may facilitate the construction of curated lexical-semantic resources; on the other hand, they can power robust frame-sentence matching procedures. The present work focuses on the Italian language. It concerns an experiment of using a rich lexical resource for Italian verbs, namely T-PAS AUTHOR to fine-tune an open multilingual model, namely Mistral 7B AUTHOR, to recognize and extract verbal patterns from Italian sentences using a technique called IRPO AUTHOR. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we introduce the T-PAS resource for Italian verbs, which we used in our experiments. Section 3 discusses in detail the methodology we applied and references closely related works, whereas Section 4 illustrates the experimental setup. We complete the paper by discussing our results in Section 5 and by drawing some conclusions as well as making suggestions for future research in Section 6.","In conclusion, we can say that small multilingual baseline models such as Mistral 7B perform poorly on semantic analysis of Italian sentences. We observe that the poor behavior is due to the model's inability to discern the correct answer, either because it lacks the linguistic knowledge, therefore mostly resorting on random guesses, or because it follows an incorrect explanation for the answer is about to give. However, our research also demonstrates that the model can be significantly improved using IRPO techniques without affecting the baseline performance on common sense and reasoning tasks. Notably, we observe the ability to generalize across predicates, likely due to underlying linguistic skills, though further investigation is needed to fully understand this phenomenon. The production of small open language models is rapidly evolving, approaching the level of huge close models which were available on the cloud a couple of years ago. At present, Italian monolingual models have room for improvement in terms of performance levels, } while multilingual models, e.g. the recently released Gemma 2 AUTHOR, show increasing proficiency in our language, probably due to transfer learning effects. Our research shows the potential of leveraging such models in combination with high-quality lexical resources to develop a new class of task-specific models for the Italian language. These models, while small in scale, are expected to exhibit remarkable proficiency in executing complex analytical tasks, such as those related to verbs. With this in mind, our future work is aimed, on the one hand at enriching lexicographic resources and refining the ways to obtain training material from them, and on the other hand at continuously evaluating the improvements brought about by the progress of general-purpose open models. One promising application is the use of a verbal subcategorization and frame extraction system to extract content from specialist documents, such as legal AUTHOR or medical texts AUTHOR. Furthermore, the ability to analyze the complex argument structure of verbs has potential for use in language learning systems AUTHOR, e.g. providing support for immigrants to learn Italian affordably.

This research evaluates the performance of several well-known LLMs, including \gptthree, \gptfour, \modelllama, and \modelphi, in simplifying a corpus of Italian administrative documents (\sitaist), a representative corpus of Italian administrative texts. To accurately compare the simplification abilities of humans and LLMs, six parallel corpora of a subsection of \itaist are collected. These parallel corpora were analyzed using both complexity and similarity metrics to assess the outcomes of LLMs and human participants. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform comparably to humans in many aspects, there are notable differences in structural and semantic changes. The results of our study underscore the potential and limitations of using AI for administrative text simplification, highlighting areas where LLMs need improvement to achieve human-level proficiency.","Due to the increasing popularity of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) language tools AUTHOR, significant attention has been devoted to the use of LLMs for text simplification AUTHOR. Several studies have addressed the application of LLMs to simplify texts, particularly focusing on administrative documents, including those in Italian AUTHOR. Italian administrative texts are often notably complex and obscure AUTHOR, which restricts a large segment of the population from fully accessing the content produced by the Italian public administration AUTHOR. This work aims to (a) evaluate the quality of automatic text simplification performed by several well-known LLMs, and (b) compare LLM-based simplification with human-based simplification. To address these research questions, the following procedures were undertaken: 1) From an empirical perspective, a large corpus of Italian administrative texts was collected itaist. A parallel simplified counterpart of the corpus was created using different LLMs. Additionally, a shorter version of the administrative corpus was manually simplified by two annotators. 2) From an analytical perspective, several statistical analyses were conducted to measure the semantic and complexity closeness between human and LLM-generated data. The comparison of scores for both LLM and human datasets highlights significant differences and similarities in manual and AI-driven simplification. The results concerning readability indexes Gulpease and semantic and structural similarities (edit distance) reveal that LLMs generally perform comparably to human informants. However, AI-simplified texts are slightly less similar to the original documents than those generated by human simplifiers. LLMs tend to introduce more changes in the simplified corpora than human annotators. The empirical study indicates that texts simplified by AI exhibit more structural and lexical dissimilarities from the original documents than those simplified by humans.","In this study, we investigated the automatic simplification of Italian administrative documents. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively simplify these texts, performing comparably to humans. Among the models examined, gptfour shows superior performance in text simplification, exhibiting significant improvements in complexity metrics. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that humans tend to maintain a higher level of editdistance and semsim, ensuring the preservation of the original meaning and structure of the text. In other words, humans---aware of the importance of precise language for these documents---mostly preserved the original meaning and structure, whereas LLMs, while simplifying, tended to rephrase extensively. This rephrasing, although effective in reducing complexity, might inadvertently alter the legal nuances, which are critical in administrative texts. Despite this limitation, LLMs can serve as valuable support tools for text simplification, significantly accelerating a process that typically requires hours of manual work. By generating initial drafts, LLMs can reduce the workload of human experts, who would then review and refine the AI-generated drafts, ensuring the preservation of the overall meaning and legal integrity of the text. The results achieved in our study indicated that modern LLMs can simplify administrative documents almost as effectively as humans. However, the achieved findings indicate that LLMs are not fully capable of preserving the semantic meaning of the text, tending to rephrase more extensively than humans. This could introduce legal issues into the simplified text. Further study could be conducted to evaluate the juridical equivalence of automatically simplified documents. A manual investigation of our parallel corpus, supervised by expert jurists, may reveal important implications in this sensitive context. Another promising direction for future research is to investigate the impact of automatic simplification on text comprehension. An additional empirical study could be designed to evaluate whether automatically simplified documents are easier to understand than their original versions. Additionally, it would be worthwhile to explore different prompting strategies to further improve simplification quality. For instance, few-shot prompting AUTHOR with some manually simplified gold samples could better align LLMs with human style.",11,Text Simplification

This social issue has witnessed an increase over time, particularly after Covid-19. IPV can be circumscribed into two broad categories known as Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and Cyber Intimate Partner Violence (C-IPV). Social Media and technologies can exacerbate these types of behaviours, but some ``digital footprints'', such as textual conversations, can be exploited by Artificial Intelligence models to detect and, in turn, prevent them. With this aim in mind, this paper describes a scenario in which the Italian Language Model family LLAmAntino can be exploited to explain the presence of toxicity elements in conversations related to teenage relationships and then educate the interlocutor to recognize these elements in the messages received.","Research indicates that the most prevalent form of violence is that directed toward one's partner, known as Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). Early detection of these behaviours can be instrumental in mitigating their occurrence. One of the most critical aspects of this kind of behaviour is that victims often face challenges in identifying harmful behaviours due to their close relationship with the perpetrator. Misconceptions about romantic relationships, often due to old cultural stereotypes, such as the belief that certain behaviours are normal or acceptable, can further complicate the recognition of harmful actions. In today's society, the widespread use of social media and digital platforms has evolved this issue into Cyber Intimate Partner Violence (C-IPV) and often allows the perpetrators to gain greater control over their victims by constantly monitoring their locations or interactions with other people. Contrary to common belief, these technologies can be used to address the issue of violence. In fact, building AI models to identify potential violence-related behaviours is essential, and often, it provides the only means to act promptly and in real-time. Having such a tool can serve as a preventive measure against the escalation of harmful situations, for example, by integrating it into instant messaging apps and raising alerts where harmful content is detected. In this paper, we aim to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as tools that can not only identify but also explain toxic elements in intimate conversations. More specifically, we use a dataset of conversations about teenage relationships written in Italian that has been accurately annotated by human experts. Given LLMs' capability to tackle several downstream tasks, our goal is to explore the impact of different kinds of prompts on the generation of precise explanations. The paper is structured as follows: in Section sec:relatedwork, we provide a frame of what is intimate partner violence, the different forms, and the deleterious intra and interpersonal consequences. Moreover we also provide an overview of the methods proposed in the literature. Section sec:explanations focuses on the task of explaining toxic language in the context of IPV. We describe the dataset and the different types of annotations provided by researchers in General Psychology, as well as the prompting strategy adopted to instruct the language model. Finally, in Section sec:conclusions, we draw some conclusions and discuss directions for the continuation of the work.","In this paper, we presented our proposal to adopt our LLM to identify and describe toxic elements in discussions concerning teenage relationships. In particular, the LLM was used to generate explanations that describe why a sentence, in the context of an intimate relationship, can be toxic and constitute abuse. The main outcome of our preliminary investigation is that, even with few-shot prompting, the LLM learns to provide good explanations that adhere to a standard provided by expert psychologists. By exploiting LLMs' proficiency in processing and understanding human language, our approach seeks to go beyond just detection, aiming to grasp underlying motivations and factors contributing to the emergence of harmful behaviours. In future works, we intend to perform fine-tuning steps to better adapt LLMs to the specific task at hand. We also plan to investigate how different pre-training techniques and architectures can be leveraged to enhance model performance. Supervised fine-tuning AUTHOR, for instance, is a technique that can be employed to adapt the LLM to a specific task, such as generating explanations for abusive language, by using a labelled dataset. This approach can help the model to learn from its mistakes and to correct its biases, ultimately leading to improved performance. In the context of our study, supervised fine-tuning could be used to train the LLM on a dataset of abusive language explanations, to reduce the model's error rate and increase the quality of its responses. Direct Preferences Optimization (DPO) AUTHOR is another strategy that can be used to improve the performance of the LLM. DPO is a technique that allows the model to be trained directly on a set of user-provided preferences, such as the quality of the explanations it generates. This approach can be particularly effective in domains like abusive language, where the quality of the explanations is critical to ensure that the model does not perpetuate harmful biases. To ensure the effectiveness of our approach, we intend to confront our methodology with other models and incorporate further annotations to enhance the robustness and effectiveness of our methodology. This involves comparing the performance of our LLMs with other state-of-the-art models.

Their capability to extract general-purpose features makes them a strong alternative to low-level descriptors. Most studies focus on English, with limited research on other languages. We evaluate English-Only and Multilingual LSMs from the Wav2Vec 2.0 and Whisper families as feature extractors for SER in eight languages. We have stacked three alternative downstream classifiers of increasing complexity, named Linear, Non-Linear, and Multi-Layer, on top of the LSMs. Results indicate that Whisper models perform best with a simple linear classifier using features from the last transformer layer, while Wav2Vec 2.0 models benefit from features from the middle and early transformer layers.

Deep learning has introduced advanced techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) AUTHOR, eventually followed by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) AUTHOR, and TransformersAUTHOR. Transformers' ability to learn from extensive datasets has led to Large Speech Models (LSMs), which generalize across various speech tasks. Common training approaches for these models include Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), which uses data itself to learn general-purpose features AUTHOR, and Weakly-Supervised Learning (WSL), which pairs audio with text for tasks like transcription and translation AUTHOR. The general-purpose knowledge of LSMs makes them effective feature extractors for SER. Research has adapted LSMs for SER in English AUTHOR, but efforts for other languages are limited, focusing on Wav2Vec 2.0 AUTHOR for cross-lingual SER AUTHOR. This study examines how effective LSMs are as feature extractors for cross-lingual SER, using nine datasets across eight languages: Italian, German, French, Canadian French, Spanish, Greek, Persian, and Egyptian Arabic. Specifically, we utilize LSMs from the Wav2Vec 2.0 and Whisper AUTHOR model families, pre-trained with SSL and WSL approaches, respectively. We introduce Whisper due to its underexplored use in cross-lingual SER. To assess the effectiveness of LSMs as feature extractors, we test three classifiers of increasing complexity—Linear, Non-Linear, and Multi-Layer—across nine datasets.

There has been a marked increase in interest in this task, accompanied by a corresponding growth in the scientific community involved in developing computational approaches to semantic change. In recent years, a number of resources have been made available for the evaluation of LSC models in a number of languages, including English, Swedish, German, Latin, Russian and Chinese. DIACR-ITA is the only existing resource for LSCD in Italian. However, DIACR-ITA has a different format from that used for other languages. In this paper, we present DWUGs-IT, which extends the DIACR-ITA dataset with additional target words and usage-sense pair annotations and adapts it to the DURel format, including the first implementation of a LSCD graded task for Italian.","As is the case with both society and culture, language is subject to change over time. Two key factors cause such linguistic change. Firstly, there are purely evolutionary and linguistic considerations driven by the need for more efficient communication AUTHOR. One example of this is the use of abbreviations and acronyms, such as LOL (Laughing Out Loud), which have become commonplace on social media platforms. Secondly, changes in society and culture lead to changes in language. This can be seen, for example, in the adoption of a more inclusive language, as evidenced by grammatically gendered languages, including Italian and the introduction of {\schwa} to replace masculine and feminine endings AUTHOR. Language may undergo alteration at various levels, including morphological, syntactic, and semantic. Semantic change concerns the alteration of the meaning of words over time. The study of semantic change is a prominent area of research in Historical Linguistics, with the aim of investigating the linguistic mechanisms that characterize the change and the causes that trigger it. For instance, \citet{blank2012prinzipien} provides a broad study on the characterization of semantic change, identifying a number of different types of change, including metaphor, metonymy, generalization, specialization, co-hyponym transfer and auto-antonym. The English word bad, for example, has acquired an auto-antonym meaning, i.e. a meaning that is the opposite of its original meaning. In addition to its original connotation of poor quality or negative, it has also acquired the opposite connotation of good or cool. The term meat has undergone a process of specialization in its meaning, whereby it has shifted from referring to any kind of food in general to exclusively denoting the meat of animals consumed as food. While traditional linguistic methods are informative, they are often based on small, carefully curated samples. In contrast, linguistic analyses using computational models not only accelerate our understanding of language change but also provide broader and more detailed insights, thereby facilitating the study of vast corpora across a wider range of genres and time AUTHOR. From a computational perspective, two key challenges emerge in the study of semantic change: the modelling of word meanings over time and the detection of change AUTHOR. At the synchronic level, ignoring the temporal dimension with a focus on modern corpora, the Natural Language Processing community has made significant strides in modelling word meanings, with approaches such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) AUTHOR playing a pivotal role. Computational modelling of semantic change introduces a significant level of complexity, as it necessitates the handling of meanings that are either extinct or novel in comparison to existing lexicographic resources, such as WordNet, as well as dynamically changing meaning representations. In recent years, great efforts have been made to advance the field of computational methods for Lexical Semantic Change Detection. With initiatives such as the Workshop on Computational Approaches to Historical Language Change AUTHOR promoting research in this field or shared tasks such as SemEval 2020 Task 1 AUTHOR, RuShiftEval AUTHOR, DIACR-ITA AUTHOR, or LSCD Discovery AUTHOR leading to the development of the first evaluation resources. DIACR-Ita, hosted in EVALITA 2020 AUTHOR, is the first shared task specifically created for the evaluation of models for Lexical Semantic Change in Italian. The majority of the evaluation resources follow a two-task approach: (1) a binary task, which requires the assignment of a word to either the changed or stable label, based on whether the word has undergone a change in meaning or not; and (2) a graded (ranking) task, which requires the sorting of words based on the extent of their change (over time). These labels are assigned on the basis of human-annotated data, typically in the form of a graded word-in-context task. %or something about how the ""rest"" of the data looks like because in the end of the next line you say that Diacr-ita does not release this data. Then it is good to know what it is and what it is good for. DIACR-Ita, however, diverges from the evaluation process employed in SemEval 2020 Task 1, RushiftEval and several other datasets that emerged subsequently. This results in a distinct configuration of the task and the released data. For example, DIACR-Ita only has a binary task but does not include a graded task. Moreover, only the target words with their gold truth labels were made available for the shared task, while the remaining data produced during the annotation process were not.

Our approach evaluates the models' capacity to generate sentences that adhere to specific linguistic constraints and their ability to recognize the linguistic properties of their own generated sentences, also in terms of consistency with the specified constraints. We tested our approach on six Italian LLMs using various linguistic constraints.","Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) AUTHOR have exhibited extraordinary proficiency in a wide range of tasks, from text generation to complex problem-solving, by producing coherent and fluent texts AUTHOR. Their ability to understand context, generate human-like responses, and even engage in creative tasks underscores their potential in various applications. Such capabilities have been extensively evaluated against several benchmarks, as evidenced by the success of platforms such as the OpenLLM Leaderboard AUTHOR or Italian LLM-Leaderboard AUTHOR, specifically developed to evaluate Italian models. %in a task-oriented scenario covering a wide range of NLP tasks. However, despite their impressive capabilities, the evaluation of LLMs' linguistic abilities when generating sentences remains an understudied topic. In fact, while earlier works have demonstrated the implicit encoding of many linguistic phenomena within the representations of smaller models AUTHOR or by prompting LLMs to assess their linguistic competence AUTHOR, there is no guarantee that generative LLMs can comply with such properties in generating texts. Studies on Controllable Text Generation (CTG) indirectly assessed models' capabilities by examining their adherence to linguistic constraints AUTHOR. For instance, AUTHOR studied the abilities of LLMs in adhering to lexical and morpho-syntactic constraints %for the task of personalized text generation. when generating personalized texts. Nevertheless, these works are mainly focused on task-oriented scenarios (e.g. text simplification) and therefore they do not provide systematic evaluations of the linguistic abilities of these models. [t!] \centering \includesvg[width=0.48\textwidth]{frame-example.svg From a complementary perspective, in recent years, several works have proposed diverse approaches to assess the consistency of LLMs as an essential component of the models' evaluation AUTHOR, where consistency can be defined as ``the requirement that no two statements given by the system are contradictor'' AUTHOR or ""the invariance of its behaviour under meaning-preserving alternations in its input"" AUTHOR. Despite their differences, all these approaches aim to understand the reasoning processes that the models employ in various reasoning tasks AUTHOR while also measuring the predictability and coherence of the models' generated responses under different conditioning inputs. Among these, AUTHOR studied the consistency between generation (e.g.\ ``what is 7+8?'') and validation (e.g. ""7+8=15, True or False?'') of LLMs considering 6 different tasks (e.g. arithmetic reasoning, style transfer). AUTHOR, instead, employed several consistency checks to measure models' faithfulness and to understand whether self-explanations truly reflect the model’s behaviour. Importantly, the training procedure of an LM does not explicitly target consistency AUTHOR, meaning this ability to produce non-contradictory statements eventually emerges as a byproduct of pre-training and fine-tuning. Therefore, studying models under such conditions serves as a valuable proxy for evaluating their capacity to handle different but complementary tasks, such as generation vs. validation. In this paper, we bring together the two perspectives and propose an evaluation approach to thoroughly test the linguistic abilities of several Italian LLMs. Specifically, by instructing a model to generate sentences that adhere to a set of targeted linguistic constraints (e.g.\ ``Generate a sentence with 2 adjectives'') and then asking to validate its own sentences (""How many adjectives does this sentence have: <s>?""), %it's possible to gather evidence about different phenomena: we seek to answer the following research questions: i) To what extent is an Italian LLM capable of generating sentences that adhere to specific linguistic constraints? ii) How consistent are LLM's responses to the validation questions w.r.t. the specified linguistic constraints? iii) How well can Italian LLMs recognize the linguistic features present in their own generated sentences? \noindent{Contributions}. Our main contributions are: \item We propose a framework for evaluating the linguistic abilities of state-of-the-art Italian LLMs when generating text. \item We conduct extensive evaluations across different models and linguistic constraints. \item We assess models' consistency with the requested constraints and their ability to validate their own generated content.","In this paper, we presented the results of a new framework to extensively evaluate the linguistic abilities of Italian LLMs when generating sentences according to multiple linguistic constraints and, subsequently, when validating the linguistic properties of their own outputs. Results showed that models' architectures and dimensions of pre-training data have an impact on their ability to correctly follow the constraints, with ANITA being the best-performing model across all configurations. When validating each model against their own generated sentences, we noticed that i) LLMs tend to be more consistent with the requested constraints when they correctly followed them during the generation phase, and ii) the generation abilities do not always align with the ability of the models to recognize the linguistic properties of their generated sentences. Our findings also highlighted that the evaluation metric chosen can significantly affect the results, underscoring the complexity of evaluating LLMs and the necessity for further research in this direction. Considering that the evaluation of LLMs is an ongoing and multifaceted effort across all languages, we believe that this study opens the way for numerous further in-depth analyses focused on various aspects of evaluation. Among other aspects, we could evaluate the overall quality of the generated sentences, which we have not accounted for so far. Preliminary investigations revealed that the overall quality of the generations varies across Italian LLMs, with Italia appearing to be the most fluent.}. Thus, future research should also involve a more comprehensive evaluation that compares the linguistic abilities of LLMs with their fluency and grammaticality. %A further direction includes the analysis of the impact of multiple annotation schemas as a means to evaluate the linguistic abilities of the models.

During the coronavirus pandemic, the Italian government issued a series of financial measures, each unique in target, requirements, and benefits. Despite the widespread dissemination of these measures, it is currently unclear how they were perceived and whether they ultimately achieved their goal. In this paper, we document the collection and release of \monica, a new social media dataset for MONItoring Coverage and Attitudes to such measures. Data include approximately ten thousand posts discussing a variety of measures in ten months. We collected annotations for sentiment, emotion, irony, and topics for each post. We conducted an extensive analysis using computational models to learn these aspects from text. We release a compliant version of the dataset to foster future research on computational approaches for understanding public opinion about government measures. We release data and code at .","Understanding public opinion on governmental decisions has always been crucial for assessing policies' effectiveness, especially when facing exceptional events requiring prompt decisions. Computational linguistics and social scientists have long observed modern social media platforms as they are a perfect stage for spreading opinions swiftly and transparently. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been widely used for analyzing public discussion \citep[e.g.,][]{medhat2014sentiment,giachanou2016like,qian2022understanding}. The COVID-19 pandemic, arguably the most prominent of such exceptional events, prompted the Italian government---and other European governments---to release multiple financial measures to cushion the impact on the population. These so-called ``bonuses,'' issued pro bono, i.e., with no interest payments from recipients, aimed at increasing liquidity and reducing tax burdens. However, despite reaching varied recipients, comprehending the measures' reception and evaluating their effectiveness still needs to be explored. To address this gap, we collect and release \monica, a new social media dataset for MONItoring Coverage and Attitudes of Italian measures to COVID-19. \monica comprises approximately 10,000 posts spanning ten months collected on X.com. These posts pertain to the Italian public's discussions on diverse financial measures introduced during the pandemic. Building on an extensive body of literature that examines public sentiment during the pandemic \citep[e.g.,][]{muller2023covid,chen2020tracking,kaur2020monitoring,scott2021measuring,wang2020covid}, this work offers new insights into the limited research specifically addressing Italy. for one of the early (and few) works on modelling sentiment from Twitter during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Then, we conducted an analysis using traditional models and transformer-based language models to predict these aspects from textual data, demonstrating the dataset's potential usability. Moreover, using state-of-the-art interpretability tools, we explained the models' decision processes. We found that explanations are faithful and plausible to human judgments. \monica will allow a retrospective examination of the efficacy -- and inefficacy -- of governmental measures implemented in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic, as perceived by the population. By doing so, we seek to provide insights that can inform policymakers about the strengths and weaknesses of such financial measures, ensuring better preparedness and response strategies for any future crises. \paragraph{Contributions.} We release \monica, a GDPR-compliant dataset of social media posts to monitor the coverage and people's attitude towards Italy's government's financial aid to combat the COVID-19 crisis.

The generated metaphors were evaluated in two ways: using BERTscore and by five human workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Concerning the automatic evaluation, each generated metaphorical expression was paired with a corresponding human metaphorical expressions. The overall BERTscore was the following: precision= 0.41, recall= 0.43, and F1= 0.42, suggesting that generated and human metaphors might not have captured the same semantic meaning. The human evaluation showed the model’s ability to generate metaphorical expressions, as 92% of them were classified as metaphors by the majority of the workers. Additionally, the evaluation revealed interesting patterns in terms of metaphoricity, familiarity and appeal scores across the generated metaphors: as the metaphoricity and appeal scores increased, the familiarity score decreased, suggesting that the model exhibited a certain degree of creativity, as it has also generated novel or unconventional metaphorical expressions. It is important to acknowledge that this work is exploratory in nature and has certain limitations.","The scope of this paper is to introduce an alternative approach to multimodal metaphor generation. As metaphors are not only pervasive in language but also in everyday life, influencing our thoughts and actions AUTHOR, and as human meaning representations relies on multiple modalities AUTHOR, it became relevant to study metaphors in more than one modality, in particular in the vision domain. Recent research has indeed explored multimodal metaphors generation in a variety of ways: from visual metaphor to literal language AUTHOR; and from metaphorical language to visual metaphor AUTHOR. Nevertheless, the common aspect across these studies is that the metaphorical quality was already present either in the linguistic or in the visual input employed. Therefore, this paper proposes an alternative approach that involves generating metaphorical linguistic expressions from non-metaphorical images, which lack inherent metaphorical qualities. To accomplish this, we employed the new multimodal model LLaVA 1.5 AUTHOR and adopted a two-step approach known as multimodal chain-of-thought prompting AUTHOR: given the first prompt, the model generates the content of the picture; then, the model is provided with both the generated output and a specific prompt to facilitate metaphor generation. The metaphors generated by the model were evaluated through BERTscore AUTHOR and by human workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results show the model's ability to generate metaphorical expressions, with 92% of the generated expressions being classified as metaphors. Additionally, the evaluation revealed interesting patterns in terms of the metaphoricity, familiarity and appeal scores of the generated expressions. Interestingly, as the metaphoricity score increases, the familiarity score decreases while the appeal score increases. This suggests that the model was able to create novel or uncommon metaphorical expressions which may differ from the more conventional metaphors, which the evaluators might have been more familiar with. Despite being less familiar, the metaphorical expressions were preferred over the non-metaphorical ones. It is important to acknowledge that this is an exploratory work, which aims to offer a different approach in multimodal metaphor generation. As such, it is essential to point out the presence of some limitations, in particular concerning the choice of the visual inputs and the constraints of human evaluation.","This study aimed to explore an alternative approach for multimodal metaphor generation using the new LLaVA 1.5 model and Multimodal-CoT prompting.

It is important to state again that this is an exploratory work with some limitations. One limitation to consider is the choice of the images used in the study. As manually selected from Google Image, their quality may influence the quality of the captions and metaphors generated by the model. Another limitation to consider is the subjectivity of the evaluation process, it is possible that Amazon MTurk workers may lack the necessary sensitivity and background knowledge to accurately recognize and evaluate metaphorical expressions, despite the instructions included background information about metaphor. Future works should aim to address these limitations by selecting more accurate images, as well as incorporating more diverse and expert annotators. Despite these limitations, the task show promising results for future research in the field of metaphorical and visual reasoning. \appendix",13,Multimodal

We compare three topic modeling algorithms: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Embedded Topic Model (ETM), and Product of Experts LDA (ProdLDA), using a dataset of 35,000 suspicious activity reports from an Italian bank. The models were evaluated using the coherence score, NPMI coherence, and topic diversity metrics. Our results show that ProdLDA consistently outperformed LDA and ETM, with the best performance achieved using 1-gram word embeddings. The study reveals distinct topics related to specific client activities, cross-border transactions, and high-risk business sectors, like gambling. These results demonstrate the potential of advanced topic modeling techniques in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of auditing processes in the banking sector, particularly in the analysis of activities that could be tied to money laundering and terrorism.","There has always been a close connection between banks and the collection of different kinds of empirical data: banks, just like any other company, have always poured large amounts of resources into understanding numbers, and how to deal with them. Numerical data, being closely related to the financial performances of companies, has always taken the spotlight. On the other hand, linguistic data has always been much less considered, due to the difficulties of analysis and underwhelming performances. But things are changing. More and more companies are understanding the value of language, which contains information that no number can convey. Different Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, language resources, and computational linguistics practices have now become a staple in many realities, like sentiment analysis AUTHOR and word embeddings AUTHOR. In fact, there is a wide variety of linguistic data that banks can exploit: emails, bank transfers descriptions, internal communications, and customer feedback. Some peculiar issues arise, when dealing with linguistic data in the banking sector, like the usage of acronyms, abbreviations and technical terminology. These data are often proprietary, meaning that the bank owns them, and the access is forbidden to externals. While the quantity of information they contain is massive, a downside is that the impossibility of sharing it with other banks hinders the possibility of a more global analysis. In this context, this paper wants to explore the application of topic modeling techniques to the auditing process, in particular regarding the analysis of reviews of anti-money laundering (AML) alerts. Topic modeling can, in fact, be an incredibly helpful tool for auditors who want to perform an in-depth analysis on large amounts of data. An overview of topic modeling algorithms and applications in the banking sector, both documented in scientific research and in concrete applications within banks, will be presented. Then, we will provide a comprehensive description of the data employed, followed by the preprocessing operations. We will then present the results and their interpretation, leading us into the conclusions. Finally, we will present a number of future works suggestions, which can expand this topic.","NLP is now an essential component of the banking sector, and any company that wants to be competitive should make use of linguistic data science. In particular, in this paper we presented a NLP task, topic modeling, and how it can be implemented in the daily job of bank employees, in order to perform more detailed investigations. In particular, topic modeling can be a key component in the understanding and identification of money laundering schemes, as it allows auditors to perform more in-depth and focused analyses. For example, auditors could investigate patterns from the recent years, in order to have a better understanding on whether an activity is part of a larger trend, or an anomaly that deserves attention. After citing other implementations of topic modeling in banking, we described the data employed, and its preprocessing, consisting in stopwords removal and lemmatization. Examples were provided, showing the peculiarities of the documents in the dataset. Then, the data was processed using three algorithms: LDA, ETM and ProdLDA. These algorithms were evaluated using three metrics: coherence score, NPMI score, and topic diversity. The optimal hyperparameters were found using SOBO. Optimization and processing were performed using four different configurations: without additional word embeddings, enhanced by 1-gram word embeddings created from our dataset, enhanced by 2-grams word embeddings created from our dataset, and enhanced by pre-trained word embeddings. The results show that ProdLDA's performance was far superior than its competition, especially when employing 1-gram Word2Vec embeddings. The algorithm outputted distinct and interpretable topics, which can provide a great insight into the data. This experiment also has a large potential of being expanded. In particular, future works could employ a more computationally performing machine, in order to make use of the whole dataset, as well as performing MOBO, and obtain more precise hyperparameters. Finally, it is also possible to perform the same analysis on different kinds of data, in order to notice more clearly the differences and similarities from one kind of linguistic data to another, and their similarities. There are also new techniques that could have a great impact on this research, such as LLMs, Attention-based topic modeling, and Contrastive topic modeling.",20,In-domain IR and IE

In recent years, many resources have been created to investigate this association and automatically detect emotions from texts. Presenting ELIta (Emotion Lexicon for Italian), this study provides a new language resource for the analysis and detection of emotions in Italian texts. It describes the process of lexicon creation, including lexicon selection and annotation methodologies, and compares the collected data with existing resources. By offering a non-aggregated lexicon, ELIta fills a crucial gap and is applicable to various research and practical applications. Furthermore, the work utilises the lexicon by analysing the relationships between emotions and gender.","Emotions and language are deeply interrelated human characteristics. Language serves as a tool to communicate our feelings, while affective studies have shown that emotion permeates all aspects of language AUTHOR, such as morphology AUTHOR, phonology AUTHOR, and semantics AUTHOR. This intricate relationship has recently attracted significant attention in fields such as computational linguistics, natural language processing (NLP), and affective computing. Research focusing on the identification of emotions from texts has produced various language resources, particularly emotion lexicons developed using diverse annotation methodologies, ranging from manual AUTHOR to automatic AUTHOR, and from expert judgment AUTHOR to crowdsourcing AUTHOR. Most studies follow the dimensional approach to emotions AUTHOR. According to this perspective, the PAD (Pleasure, Arousal, Dominance) AUTHOR or VAD (Valence, Arousal, Dominance) AUTHOR model posits that the fundamental dimensions of valence (the intrinsic attractiveness (positive valence) or aversion (negative valence) of an event, object or situation), arousal (the level of physiological activation, ranging from sleep to excitement) and dominance (the degree of control a person feels over a situation) explain the majority of the emotional meaning of words. This approach has been highly productive for research on emotional language and the creation of language resources, exemplified by the ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) AUTHOR, NRC VAD AUTHOR, and the EmoBank corpus AUTHOR. Alternatively, some researchers argue for the existence of a limited number of discrete primary emotion categories that have evolved to serve various adaptive functions through specific neural signatures, facial expressions, cognitive evaluations, and behavioral action tendencies AUTHOR. These basic emotions typically include joy, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, surprise, whereas \citeauthor{plutchik1980general} also considers trust and anticipation. Despite objections to the basic emotions model AUTHOR, it has inspired the creation of resources such as the NRC Lexicon (EmoLex) AUTHOR (translated into over 100 languages, it's the most widely used lexicon in emotion detection), and the datasets Feel It AUTHOR and Multiemotion It AUTHOR. More recently, the field of computational linguistics and NLP has recognized the need for resources specifically created for languages other than English. Critics argue against relying solely on translations, advocating for lexicons created from texts in the target language and manually annotated AUTHOR. This approach has led to the development of lexicons like the Portuguese emotional lexicon AUTHOR, which embodies the principle of ""each language for itself."" For the Italian language several language resources with emotional annotations have been produced over the years. The initial ItEM lexicon AUTHOR began by collecting seed words through an association task linking words to labels (\citeauthor{plutchik1980general}'s basic emotions), then employed cosine similarity to expand the lexicon, assuming that neighboring words in semantic space share similar emotional connotations. The results, validated through crowdsourcing, showed low reliability for the emotions trust, anticipation (translated as ‘attese') and surprise. The more recent Depeche Mood ++ AUTHOR was automatically created from judgements given by readers of articles on the ‘Corriere della Sera’ newspaper website and uses a unique scale of emotions not directly comparable to others, such as ANNOYED, AFRAID, SAD, AMUSED, and HAPPY. AUTHOR. In the case of Affective Norms AUTHOR, the tendency to create resources by adapting the English model with annotations in L1 languages other than English has resulted in Affective Norms for several languages, including Spanish AUTHOR and Dutch AUTHOR. For Italian, there has been a specific adaptation of the ANEW collected by AUTHOR. Despite the existing resources in the literature, a notable gap persists. There is a lack of manually annotated Italian language resources that combine both discrete emotion annotations and dimensional evaluations. Furthermore, no available resource provides a non-aggregated version of the data. This paper presents ELIta (Emotion Lexicon for Italian), an innovative resource designed for the analysis of emotions in the Italian language and emotion detection from text. ELIta aims to bridge this gap by providing a lexicon annotated using both categorical and dimensional approaches, and by offering a non-aggregated version of the data. This aligns with the perspectivist viewpoint, which values disagreement as valuable information AUTHOR. The development process of ELIta, including lexicon selection, annotation methodologies, and a comparative analysis with existing Italian sentiment lexicons, is thoroughly described. Finally, analyses of the relationships between emotions and between dimensions and gender are presented.","This research introduces a new lexicon for Italian that collects word-emotion associations. Notably, it is the first lexicon, to the authors' knowledge, to be annotated using both categorical and dimensional approaches. Furthermore, it offers an innovative non-aggregated version of the data, reflecting a ‘perspectivist’ approach that values disagreement as valuable information, such as women showing a greater tendency towards negative valence and higher arousal ratings than man. Analyses using correlations between basic emotions and dimensions, along with comparisons to existing resources such as ANEW, underscore the lexicon's potential to deepen our understanding of the interplay between emotions and language. While ELIta represents a significant step forward in capturing the complexity of emotion-language interactions in Italian, continued development will be essential to addressing its current limitations and maximizing its utility as a comprehensive tool for emotional analysis. \appendix",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Through the use of training data augmentation via machine translation (MT), multilingual NER can become a powerful tool for information extraction in multilingual contexts. In this paper, we augment NER data from culinary recipe ingredient lists by means of MT and word alignment (WA), following two approaches: \Ni translating each entity separately, while taking into account the full context of the list and \Nii translating the whole list of ingredients and then aligning entities using three types of WA models: Giza++, Fast Align, and BERT, fine-tuned using a novel entity-shuffling approach. We depart from English data and produce Italian versions via MT, span-annotated with the entities projected from English.

Therefore we argue that, given cuisine's multicultural nature, more research in this direction is warranted. Entity label projection AUTHOR aims to address this scarcity by automating the data generation process for NER. This task consists in taking the labels associated with spans from a source text and automatically applying them to its translation in another language, i.e. the target text. Through this task, we attempt to find an efficient automatic way of developing models for entity projection across languages to produce high-quality multilingual data for recipe Named Entities (r-NE) AUTHOR. Departing from an English-language dataset containing ingredients from culinary recipes, annotated at the span level with entity category labels, we first rely on a MT engine to translate each source entity s_i individually into Italian, while keeping the full context into account.

647_2024,2024,103_Paper___Source.docx,"Irene Fioravanti, Luciana Forti, Stefania Spina",Automatic Error Detection: Comparing AI vs. Human Performance on L2 Italian Texts,ENG,3,3,1,Università per Stranieri di Perugia,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Perugia,"This paper reports on a study aimed at comparing AI vs. human performance in detecting and categorising errors in L2 Italian texts. Four LLMs were considered: ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Llama3. Two groups of human annotators were involved: L1 and L2 speakers of Italian. A gold standard set of annotations was developed. A fine-grained annotation scheme was adopted, to reflect the specific traits of Italian morphosyntax, with related potential learner errors. Overall, we found that human annotation outperforms AI, with some degree of variation with respect to specific error types. We interpret this as a possible effect of the over-reliance on English as main language used in NLP tasks. We, thus, support a more widespread consideration of different languages.","Identifying errors in texts written by second language (L2) learners is a relevant task in several research areas, which can also have practical applications in a variety of fields. Error analysis is a traditional approach adopted in second language acquisition research for decades (Corder 1967), which learner corpus research has more recently revisited in light of the availability of learner corpora and corpus-based methods of analysis (Dagneaux et al. 1998). In addition, acquisitional research on learners’ errors has relevant pedagogical implications involving error-related feedback: appropriate corrective feedback can lead to improved writing skills in both L1 and L2 writing (Biber et al. 2011). Furthermore, automatic error detection and categorisation is key in language testing and assessment research and practice, with reference to automated essay scoring (e.g.,Song 2024), which has important implications for rubric descriptors. The interest of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in grammatical error correction (GEC) and grammatical error detection (GED) relies on the creation of systems used in Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL), Automated Essay Scoring (AES) or Automatic Writing Evaluation (AWE) contexts. ICALL systems integrate NLP techniques into CALL platforms, providing learners with flexible and dynamic interactions in their learning process. AES systems automatically grade written texts with machine learning techniques, as well as AWE systems, which also provide learners with feedback. Identifying and annotating errors in the performance of L2 learners, while beneficial for both pedagogical and research purposes, presents considerable challenges. This process is typically conducted manually in the case of learner corpora due to the inherent nature of errors as latent phenomena. The manual identification of learners’ errors requires a substantial degree of subjective judgment by human annotators (Dobrić 2023), as well as a considerable investment in terms of time. The present study aims to contribute to the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the task of automatic grammatical error detection (GED) in written texts produced by L2 learners. In particular: 1. it evaluates the behaviour of different LLMs in relation to an error detection task in written texts produced by L2 learners of Italian, a language other than English, in line with recent studies criticising the over-reliance on English in NLP research (Søgaard 2022) and seeking to contribute to the very few studies that do consider languages other English (e.g., MultiGED-2023; Volodina et a. 2023); 2. it targets specific error types and grammatical categories in order to mitigate the problems arising from the broadness of the notion of error, focusing on clear-cut and possibly unambiguous error categories; 3. it relies on a high degree of accuracy in error annotation, which was manually performed by three researchers on a small learner dataset serving as the test set on which the systems are evaluated; 4. it assesses the performance of LLMs in error detection and categorisation, through a comparison with the performance of native Italian students and advanced learners of L2 Italian on the same task.","The main aim of our paper was to investigate whether AI can be a valid support for second language acquisition research, in learner error detection, with specific reference to a language other than English, i.e., Italian. Our study compared the performance of four LLMs among them and also compared with L1 and L2 annotators. A GS, produced by the annotations of three trained linguists, was adopted as benchmark. Given the richness of Italian morphosyntax and the variety of possible morphosyntactic errors that L2 Italian learners may produce, contrary to the few other studies on Italian, this study considered three different error types for two of the parts of speech listed in Table 1, i.e. article and preposition. This methodological novelty can potentially lead to much more fine-grained results, while counterbalancing, like in our case, the low number of annotated texts. The general finding about human annotators performing better than LLMs, both in terms of overall error detection and in terms of error type detection, is particularly significant if we consider the structural differences between English and other languages. Italian, like many other languages, is characterised by rich morphosyntatic traits, which inevitably have a considerable impact on the computational processing of L1 and L2 texts. Our findings may thus be a reflection of the well-known language bias in NLP, linked to the dominance of English, which then leads to a number of scientific but also social inequalities (Søgaard 2022; Volodina et al. 2023). Repeating the study with pre-trained LLMs might improve their performance. At present, pivotal tasks such as automatic error detection and classification, performed on a morphologically rich language such as Italian, does not seem to be viable with LLMs, as they do not add effectiveness to the same task performed manually.Future developments of this study may also include fine-tuned models, which are generally indicated as potentially better-performing than non-tuned ones (Kruijsbergen et al. 2024), as well as an increased number of annotated texts and an even more fine-grained and extended error annotation scheme. Automatic error detection and classification can be crucial for both the development of online language assessment systems and for second language acquisition research as a whole. This is especially true for languages other than English, which continue to be severely under-represented in all domains of language sciences, including NLP.",8,Learner Corpora and Language Acquisition

In contrast with older architectures, which were aimed at solving specific linguistic assignments, Large Language Models have shown outstanding capabilities in solving several tasks at once, raising the question of whether they can truly comprehend natural language. Nevertheless, evaluating this kind of capability is far from easy. One of the proposed solutions so far is using benchmarks that combine various types of tasks. This approach is based on the premise that achieving good performance in each of these individual tasks can imply having developed a model capable of understanding language. However, while this assumption is not incorrect, it is evident that it is not sufficient, and the evaluation of Large Language Models still remains an open challenge. %However, many of these pre-trained checkpoints have been trained mainly in English, meaning they lack the same linguistic skills for other languages. Because of this, many works have adapted these pre-trained models to other languages with fewer resources and evaluated them using state-of-the-art benchmarks. %Still, these benchmarks focus on closed-ended reasoning-based tasks that test the inherent knowledge inside a model. %We argue that it is not a correct practice to evaluate adapted models and study other approaches on the same benchmarks and datasets to assess whether our hypothesis is correct. In this paper, we conduct a study aimed at highlighting the potential and limitations of current datasets and how a new evaluation setting applied to language-adapted Large Language Models may provide more insight than traditional approaches.","Large Language Models (LLMs) are models based on the Transformer architecture capable of solving a wide variety of Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, even those not encountered during training, due to their extensive training and large number of parameters. Thanks to their remarkable skills, interest in LLMs is now at its climax, resulting in a proliferation of open-weight models (e.g. \textsc{LLaMA}, \textsc{Mistral}, and many others). Among the several challenges related to the development of LLMs, one of the most critical is their evaluation AUTHOR. One approach to tackle this issue has been to build benchmarks that collect different datasets, with the aim of obtaining a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's overall capabilities. Currently, there is a leaderboard} AUTHOR which keeps track of the capabilities of openly available LLMs. Specifically, the models are tested on six tasks that span different abilities a language model should have, e.g. reasoning or text completion. Regarding their reasoning abilities, the models are tested by solving closed-ended tasks. Specifically, multiple-choice question answering tasks are provided, where a question is given with a list of possible alternatives associated with an identifier (a letter, a number, and so on). Intuitively, since the model has also been pre-trained on closed-ended question-answering data, it should be able to generalize and understand the correct choice out of the available ones. Furthermore, rather than generating the output directly, the probabilities learned by the model are studied, using log-likelihood to assess which option is more likely to be correct. For the English language, this evaluation methodology has been a standard approach to assess the capabilities of LLMs. However, when adapting a model to a new language, due to the low amount of non-English data that has been used to pre-train such models, this methodology may not be as sound. The model only has to generate the correct option identifier, therefore this is not really testing the ability of the model of generating high-quality text in another language. The goal of this work is to understand whether a new evaluation setting applied to language-adapted LLMs may give more insight than the traditional approach. Therefore, our contributions are the following: \item We test two evaluation settings for language-adapted LLMs changing the structure of closed-ended question answering tasks; \item We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art models on these settings; \item We study the sensitivity that the models have for the input prompt.","We have carried out a study on the effectiveness of evaluation of Italian-adapted LLMs on closed-ended tasks, multiple-choice question answering tasks specifically. We have experimented with two settings: an open-ended one and a closed-ended one without option identifiers. The results show better performance for the latter. Furthermore, they also show that, with respect to the Open Italian LLM Leaderboard, there are significant differences regarding model performance. We can conclude that the evaluation of Italian-adapted models should follow a more rigorous procedure which does not mainly rely on closed-ended tasks. We release the code that was used on GitHub}.

The pipeline was developed during the process of updating the European Parliament Translation and Interpreting Corpus (EPTIC), leveraging recent NLP advancements to automate challenging tasks like multilingual alignment and speech recognition. Our findings indicate that current technologies can streamline corpus construction, with fine-tuning showing promising results in terms of transcription quality compared to out-of-the-box Whisper models. The lowest overall WER achieved for English was 0.180, using a fine-tuned Whisper-small model. As for Italian, the lowest WER (0.152) was obtained by the Whisper Large-v2 model, with the fine-tuned Whisper-small model still outperforming the baseline (0.201 vs. 0.219).","The present paper introduces a pipeline for the construction of multimodal and multilingual parallel corpora that could be used for translation and interpreting studies (TIS), among others. The construction of such resources has been acknowledged as a ``formidable task'' AUTHOR, which if automated ---as we propose--- involves a number of subtasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), multilingual sentence alignment, and forced alignment, each of which poses its own challenges. Yet tackling these subtasks also offers a unique way to evaluate state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) tools against a unique, multilingual benchmark. In this paper we discuss the development of a modular pipeline adaptable for each of these subtasks and address the issue of whether performing ASR with OpenAI’s Whisper AUTHOR could be suitable for verbatim transcription. We showcase the utility of this pipeline by expanding the European Parliament Translation and Interpreting Corpus (EPTIC), a multimodal parallel corpus comprising speeches delivered at the European Parliament along with their official interpretations and translations AUTHOR. The transcription conventions adopted for the compilation of EPTIC were developed ad hoc and aim at reproducing minimal prosodic features, but can still be considered an instance of verbatim transcription AUTHOR; the issue of what truly constitutes verbatimness is still an object of debate and will be further discussed. There is fairly widespread agreement on the statement that every transcription system reflects a certain methodological approach AUTHOR, and that by ``choosing not to transcribe a particular dimension, the researcher has implicitly decided that the dimension plays no role in the phenomenon in question'' AUTHOR. To investigate the characteristics of Whisper's AUTHOR transcriptions in English and Italian, we formulate the following two research questions: RQ1~Is it possible to use fine-tuning to adapt the transcription style to the one of an expert annotator? RQ2~What is the impact of speech type (native, non-native, interpreted) on transcription quality? We find that satisfactory results can be achieved with automatic speech recognition, although challenges remain, especially with regards to the verbatimness of the transcription ---a crucial factor in corpora intended for TIS\@. Fine-tuning Whisper-small on English data obtains a lower word error rate (WER) of 0.180 compared to Whisper-large v2 (0.194), potentially indicating that fine-tuning Whisper models holds promise for improving their performance in terms of adhering to a certain transcription style. However, this was not the case when considering the experiments based on Italian. In the Italian scenario, Whisper-large-v2 obtained a WER of 0.152 compared to a WER of 0.201 obtained by the fine-tuned Whisper-small model. It should be noted, however, that this constituted an improvement over the baseline Whisper-small model, which obtained a higher WER of 0.219. A significant limitation in the case of fine-tuning in Italian was constituted by the smaller amount of data available for tuning compared to English. Lastly, we find that sentence alignment can be facilitated through state-of-the-art embedding-based tools, whereas forced alignment can be considered a largely solved problem. This makes the construction of corpora such as EPTIC more streamlined and requiring less human intervention, with wider implications for multilingual corpus construction in the field of TIS and beyond.","This paper presented a novel pipeline for constructing multimodal and multilingual parallel corpora, with a focus on evaluating state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition tools for verbatim transcription. Experiments with Whisper models on EPTIC revealed robust performance across languages and speech types, particularly for English and Italian. However, some limitations remain regarding ASR performance and achieving verbatim transcriptions. Fine-tuning Whisper showed promising reductions in WER, particularly for English, indicating the potential of adapting the model to use a more verbatim style. Yet qualitative analysis revealed inconsistencies in handling disfluencies, truncations, and discourse markers. Furthermore, higher WERs for non-native and interpreted speech underscore remaining challenges. Future research efforts could explore incorporating additional metrics beyond WER to better capture the degree of verbatimness in the transcriptions, and expanding the Italian dataset to potentially improve the performance of the fine-tuned model. Another avenue for research could include augmenting the dataset with external data containing pairs of audio and verbatim transcripts, most notably the Switchboard corpus introduced in AUTHOR. Other methods besides fine-tuning could be explored to enhance the quality of transcriptions, for instance by leveraging the official verbatim reports on the European Parliament’s website. Lastly, a model could be developed for detecting the metadata item relative to the speech type, i.e.\ impromptu, read out, or mixed, based on textual or multimodal features. The work of A.

An Experiment on Small-LM Training on Child-Directed Speech in Italian,ENG,8,5,0,IUSS,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Pavia,"Here we discuss strategies and results of a small-sized training program based on Italian child-directed speech (less than 3M tokens) for various network architectures. The rationale behind these experiments [1] lies in the attempt to understand the effect of this naturalistic training diet on different models' architecture. Preliminary findings lead us to conclude that: (i) different tokenization strategies produce mildly significant improvements overall, although segmentation aligns more closely with linguistic intuitions in some cases, but not in others; (ii) modified LSTM networks (eMG-RNN variant) with a single layer and a structurally more controlled cell state perform slightly worse in training loss (compared to standard one- and two-layered LSTM models) but better on linguistically critical contrasts. This suggests that standard loss/accuracy metrics in autoregressive training procedures are linguistically irrelevant and, more generally, misleading since the best-trained models produce poorer linguistic predictions ([2], pace [3]). Overall, the performance of these models remains significantly lower compared to that of 7-year-old native-speaker children in the relevant linguistic contrasts we considered [4].","According to the mainstream LLM development pipeline, Transformer-based architectures [5] outperform sequential training models, like LSTM [6], in various NLP tasks. When small-sized training data are available, optimization becomes necessary [7], [8], but common optimization techniques neglect the linguistically relevant fact that these models (i) conflate semantic/world knowledge with morpho-syntactic competence, (ii) require unreasonable training data compared to that needed by children during language acquisition, (iii) the higher their performance, the lower their return in cognitive/linguistic terms [9]. In this paper we address these three issues, starting from the observation that while world knowledge uses all training data available, and the more the better, structural (morpho-syntactic and compositional semantic) knowledge might require a much smaller dataset (from 10 to 100 million words, according to [10]). We explore this intuition further and, based on prolific literature from the ‘80s showing that typical child errors are structurally sensitive and never random [11], we model networks’ architecture to bias learning towards plausible structural configurations, possibly preventing these “small” language models (SLM) from producing wrong linguistic generalizations. We started from a mild revision of the LM training and evaluation pipeline for Italian including alternative approaches to tokenization based on pseudo-morphological decomposition (§2.2); we then approached a more structurally-driven update of the cell state in LSTM networks, which we will call eMG-RNN variants (§2.3); we finally adopted a precise testing benchmark for specific linguistic contrasts in Italian following BLiMP design [12] (§2.4). We will first set the stage in section (§2) and discuss one alternative tokenization strategy (MorPiece). A simple modification to the gating system in LSTM is proposed that mimics certain linguistic constraints. Then, we will describe the relevant experiments we have run (§3) and draw some conclusions based on the observed results (§4). A general discussion with a description of the next steps will conclude this paper (§5).","Overall, LSTM networks significantly outperform Bidirectional Transformers in this minimal pairs test on Italian. This finding is consistent with results previously discussed in the literature and suggests a clear advantage of recurrent, sequential model architectures (e.g., LSTM) over Bidirectional Transformers in terms of linguistic generalizations [38] and partially justify the renewed interest for RNN networks that we have been observed in the last couple of years [24], [26]. As far as the tokenization procedure is concerned, it is somewhat premature to draw definitive conclusions from our experiments, as MorPiece has not yet been fully optimized or tested. Specifically, the optimal cut-off threshold and minimum branching factor have not been systematically evaluated. Nevertheless, a more morphologically coherent segmentation is expected to enhance sensitivity in certain minimal contrasts. Similarly, the eMG-RNN architecture could be further explored and optimized, particularly considering specific contrasts, which may help determine whether our linguistic modeling is on the right track. Evidence to the contrary is attested by the judgments of sentences with missing thematic roles, which are often incorrectly preferred by most models, including our eMG-RNN. In the end, our results suggest that Loss/Accuracy performance registered in training is not a significant predictor of the performance on the COnVERSA test, or more generally, of the linguistic coherence of the LM trained. Likewise, the models’ dimension is not a clear predictor either: Transformers trained on the same small dataset perform randomly (in all dimensions their performance is round 50%) while eMG-RNN, which has a number of parameters similar to LSTM-2, outperforms both LSTM-2 and LSTM-1 (half size of eMG-RNN). The training size remains a striking difference compared to the input received by children: this difference of one order of magnitude suggests that the bias considered in eMG-RNN are not yet satisfactory and that our Language Acquisition Device is still more efficient; in this sense, the Poverty of Stimulus Hypothesis remains unrefuted [39] by these results. Next steps will consider extending to 10M tokens the training corpus (to match the English counterpart [1]) and further exploring the effects of optimized tokenization procedures or other minimal modifications, and optimizations [24], of recurrent neural networks.",1,Language Models

VIRC comprises 880 headlines, manually annotated for vulnerable identities, dangerous discourse, derogatory expressions, and entities. Our experiments reveal that recent large language models (LLMs) struggle with the fine-grained identification of these elements, underscoring the complexity of detecting hate speech. VIRC stands out as the first resource of its kind in these languages, offering a richer annotation scheme compared to existing corpora. The insights derived from VIRC can inform the development of sophisticated detection tools and the creation of policies and regulations to combat hate speech on social media, promoting a safer online environment. Future work will focus on expanding the corpus and refining annotation guidelines to further enhance its comprehensiveness and reliability.","Hate Speech (HS) detection is a task with a high social impact. Developing technologies that are able to recognize these forms of discrimination is not only crucial to enforce existing laws but it also supports important tasks like the moderation of social media contents. However, recognizing HS is challenging. Verbal discrimination takes different forms and involves a number of correlated phenomena that make it difficult to reduce HS to a binary classification. Analyzing the recent history of corpora annotated for HS, it is possible to observe the shift from very broad categorizations of hateful content to increasingly detailed annotation schemes aimed at understanding the complexity of this phenomenon. High-level schemes including dimensions like ""hateful/offensiveness"" or ""sexism/racism"" paved the way for more sophisticated attempts to formalize such concepts in different directions: exploring the interaction between HS and vulnerable targets; studying the impact of subjectivity; identifying the triggers of HS in texts. Despite this trend, the complex semantics of HS in texts is far from being fully explored. Information Extraction (IE) approaches to HS annotation have been rarely implemented yet. Therefore, corpora that include fine-grained structured semantic representation of HS incidents are not available. The only notable exception is recent work that treats the identification of HS targets as a span-based task. In order to fill this gap, we present the Vulnerable Identities Recognition Corpus (VIRC): a dataset of 880 Italian and Spanish headlines against migrants aimed at providing an event-centric representation of HS against vulnerable groups. The annotation scheme is built on four elements: Named Entity Recognition (NER): All the named entities involved in an HS expression: ""location,"" ""organization,"" and ""person."" Vulnerable Identity mentions: Generic mentions related to identities targeted by HS as defined by international regulatory frameworks: ""women,"" ""LGBTQI,"" ""ethnic minority,"" and ""migrant."" Derogatory mentions: All mentions that negatively portray people belonging to vulnerable groups. Dangerous speech: The part of the message that is perceived as hateful against named entities or vulnerable identities. In this paper, we present a preliminary annotation experiment intended to validate the scheme and to assess the impact on disagreement in such a fine-grained task. The paper is structured as follows. In the related work section, we discuss related work; in the methodology section, we describe the methodology used; in the VIRC corpus section, we introduce the VIRC corpus; and in the conclusion, we present conclusions and discuss possible future work.","The Vulnerable Identities Recognition Corpus (VIRC), created in this work, reveals the challenge of identifying vulnerable identities due to the rapid evolution of language on social media. Our experiments indicate that large language models (LLMs) struggle significantly with this task. VIRC provides a detailed and structured resource that enhances understanding of the extensive use of hate speech in Italian and Spanish news headlines. The corpus is particularly valuable as it includes more annotation dimensions compared to related studies in other languages, such as vulnerable identities, dangerous discourse, derogatory expressions, and entities. This differentiation between vulnerable identities and entities, as well as between dangerous and derogatory elements, enables the development of sophisticated detection tools that can facilitate large-scale actions to mitigate the impact of hate speech (e.g., moderation of messages and generation of counter-narratives that reduce the damage to the mental health of victims). Future work will focus on expanding this resource by doubling the size of annotations for both languages and including non-racism-related phrases to ensure the resource is comprehensive. Additionally, we plan to refine the annotation guidelines to avoid low agreement on the derogatory label, enhancing the overall reliability and utility of the corpus. These efforts will further improve the effectiveness of hate speech detection and contribute to the development of policies and tools for a safer online environment.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

However, dependency-based SRL corpora are susceptible to the dissociated nucleus problem: when a subclause's semantic and structural cores are two separate words, the dependency tree chooses the structural token as the head of the subtree, coercing the SRL annotation into making the same choice. This leads to undesirable consequences: when directly using the output of a dependency-based SRL method in downstream tasks it is useful to work with the token representing the semantic core of a subclause, not the structural core. In this paper, we carry out a linguistically-driven investigation on the dissociated nucleus problem in dependency-based SRL and propose a novel algorithm that aligns predicate-argument structures to the syntactic structures from Universal Dependencies to select the semantic core of an argument. Our analysis shows that dissociated nuclei appear more often than one might expect, and that our novel algorithm greatly increases the richness of the semantic information in dependency-based SRL. We release the software to reproduce our experiments at .","Within the field of Natural Language Processing, Semantic Role Labeling \citep[SRL]{gildea2002} is aimed at recognizing the semantic information conveyed by a sentence, more specifically identifying who did what to whom, when, where and how AUTHOR. Over the years, SRL has split into two main annotation formalisms, namely, span-based and dependency-based. The key difference between the two lies in how they identify the roles of a predicate: span-based SRL directly extracts a span of the input text as the argument of a predicate, whilst dependency-based SRL identifies the word that heads the syntactic dependency relation subtree corresponding to the argument span as the argument. Using dependency-based SRL can be beneficial in real-world settings, as i) dependency-based SRL parsers have achieved better results on standard benchmarks, and ii) the identified token can be directly utilized in several downstream tasks, including Coreference Resolution AUTHOR, Opinion Role Labeling AUTHOR, Argument Mining AUTHOR, and Concept Map Mining AUTHOR, among others. However, the use of role tokens in the above tasks requires them to carry the ``semantic meaning'' of the role. This requirement is often not fulfilled when examining both the output of state-of-the-art dependency-based SRL systems and the corpora they were trained on, such as CoNLL-2009 AUTHOR. In these annotations, it is not uncommon to have an adpositional clause serving as the head word of a semantic role, even though adpositions do not represent the semantic core of that role. In linguistics, this phenomenon is referred to as an instance of dissociated nucleus \citep[ch.~23]{tesniere-etal-2015-elements}. Although this term encompasses many different syntactical constructions, here we focus on adpositional clauses present in the CoNLL-2009 dataset, across all of its languages. In this paper, we carry out a concise, linguistically-driven investigation on dissociated nuclei in dependency-based SRL, uncovering the extent of this problem and how it affects the semantic aspect of this task. In addtion, we introduce SemDepAlign, a simple yet effective algorithm capable of mitigating this phenomenon significantly by aligning predicate-argument structures in SRL with syntactic parses from the Universal Dependencies project, which addresses the dissociated nucleus phenomenon directly in the dependency structures. Applying SemDepAlign to CoNLL-2009 results in a substantial increase in the semantic variety of role tokens, measured through a set of proxy metrics. Finally, we provide a glimpse at how addressing dissociated nuclei simplifies the alignment between Semantic Role Labeling and Semantic Parsing, specifically with Abstract Meaning Representation~\citep[AMR]{banarescu-etal-2013-abstract}. We release SemDepAlign and Aligned-CoNLL09 -- the result of applying SemDepAlign to CoNLL-2009 -- in the hope that our work can encourage a deeper focus on semantics in SRL and foster future integration of this task into downstream applications.","In this paper, we conducted an in-depth investigation on the dissociated nucleus issue in dependency-based SRL. We introduced SemDepAlign, a novel method to align predicate-argument structures in SRL with syntactic parses from the Universal Dependencies project, which addresses the dissociated nucleus phenomenon.

We employ a FrameNet-like approach previously tested to address olfactory language, which we adapt to capture gustatory events. We then propose an exploration of the data in the benchmark to show the possible insights brought by this type of approach, addressing the investigation of emotional valence in text genres. Eventually, we present a supervised system trained with the taste benchmark for the extraction of gustatory information from historical and contemporary texts.","Despite the central role of nutrition in our lives, taste has been often classified as an inferior sense in the Western philosophical tradition. This downplayed role is reflected in the vocabulary used to describe the gustatory experience, which, together with smell, is characterized by a scarcity of domain-specific terms AUTHOR. The difficulty in capturing the semantics of taste could help explain why there are few works in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Digital Humanities (DH) that deal with this sense and, in particular, the language used to describe its experience. While there has been renewed interest in the automatic extraction of nutrients and ingredients from texts for health and medicinal purpose AUTHOR, less attention has been devoted to the development of tools and models focused on capturing the semantics of sensory experiences, especially in a diachronic fashion. In this paper, we present an English benchmark for the study of gustatory language and a supervised system for the automatic extraction of taste-related events in English, which we trained using this benchmark. The benchmark was built to be a counterpart to the olfactory one presented in AUTHOR, with the idea of making the study of the language of these two senses comparable. The system is designed as a means to study the language used to describe the experience of tasting from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. The selected formal representation for the semantics of taste is based on Frame Semantics AUTHOR, and the system is trained to identify the lexical units and the possible semantic roles contributing to the construction of a gustatory event. We present the results of the experiments and an exploration of the benchmark data, aiming to demonstrate the potential of frame-based analysis for sensory studies.","In this paper, we presented a benchmark for gustatory events containing manually annotated taste-related information, built as a counterpart to the one proposed in AUTHOR. The benchmark is constructed with the same approach adopting a frame-based methodological framework to analyze sensory language. We emphasized the importance of frame-based analysis to capture sensory events by exploring the characterization of positive and negative valence in the benchmarks through the analysis of taste and smell words and sources. The analysis based on frames seems to bring relevant insights into capturing sensory valence from different perspectives, likely supporting the suitability of this approach to deal with humanistic inquiries. We then presented a supervised system to automatically extract taste-related frames, trained on this benchmark. This preliminary exploration and the results obtained with our experiments seem promising for future exploration with automatically extracted data. Indeed, the limited data of the benchmark are not enough to draw relevant conclusions, and for this reason we plan to use our system to extract more data and conduct large-scale analyses of the evolution of sensory information over time. The limited number of documents is likely a contributing factor to the significant discrepancies in accuracy among the different frame elements, necessitating more instances to enable a good generalization. Future steps should involve increasing the number of documents and providing less sparse annotations, aiming for better temporal balance. The focus should be on annotating frame elements with lower scores and fewer instances in the benchmark, such as Taste\_Carrier and Location. Additionally, alternative metrics and techniques should be employed to capture and explain performance variations across different models. As a further comparison, we plan also to assess the performance of general-purpose frame semantic parsers like LOME AUTHOR on our benchmark.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

This work is part of a larger project aimed at developing a conversational interface for users of a renewable energy community, where clarity and accuracy of the provided feedback are important for proper energy management. This comparison is based on the human evaluation of the output produced by such models using energy data as input. Specifically, the data pertains to information regarding the power flows within a household equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) plant and a battery storage system. The goal of the feedback is precisely that of providing the user with such information in a meaningful way based on the specific aspect they intend to monitor at a given moment (e.g., self-consumption levels, the power generated by the PV panels or imported from the main grid, or the battery state of charge). This evaluation experiment has the two-fold purpose of providing an exploratory analysis of the models' abilities on this specific generation task solely relying on the information and instruction provided in the prompt and as an initial investigation into their potential as reliable tools for generating user-friendly energy feedback in this intended scenario.","The provision of energy feedback plays a crucial role in promoting energy efficiency among users. The expression energy feedback (or eco-feedback) covers a wide range of energy-related information. This can include detailed reports on energy usage and production (in the case of renewable energy sources), as well as energy-saving advice, whether generic or user-specific. The primary goal of energy feedback is to allow users to make informed decisions regarding their energy management, thus promoting better conservation practices. A substantial body of literature within the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has explored various energy feedback mechanisms, primarily focusing on visual or ambient feedback as well as gamification techniques (we refer to the surveys proposed by \citet{Albertarelli-etal-2018} and \citet{Chalal-etal-2022} for further details on these aspects). However, a greater interest has been reported on the delivery of energy feedback through conversational agents AUTHOR. Furthermore, within the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG), several studies prior to the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) investigated the use of NLG architectures to communicate consumption data. Notable works include those by \citet{Trivino-Sanchez-2015} and \citet{Conde-Clemente-etal-2018}, which used fuzzy sets to tackle data-to-text generation tasks, also tailoring the linguistic description on given consumption profiles. Similarly, \citet{martinez-municio_linguistic_2018} employed fuzzy sets to produce linguistic summaries based on the consumption of specific buildings or groups of buildings, using time series data as input. This work is part of a research project aimed at developing a modular task-oriented conversational agent to inform users about their energy consumption and photovoltaic (PV) production and, more generally, to support better management of their energy resources through text-based energy feedback. The conversational agent will then be deployed and tested within a renewable energy community in Italy, which motivates our specific focus on Italian as the primary language for the interactions. At this stage of the project, we plan to integrate the generative abilities of LLMs into the conversational pipeline. This approach is expected to deliver more varied and dynamic responses instead of predefined, static templates, possibly making the user experience enjoyable. This study was driven by the need to obtain more quantitative insights into the expected performance of such models when tasked with the delivery of energy feedback based on actual energy data. The main objective of this study thus aims to verify how effectively instruction-tuned LLMs currently available for the Italian language can deliver clear and accurate feedback based on energy data provided within a prompt, without relying on more elaborate techniques like fine-tuning or Retrieval Augmented Generation. More specifically, we formulated the following research questions: \item Are the LLMs under study able to produce energy feedback that is 1) informative, 2) comprehensible, and 3) accurate with respect to the provided energy data? \item Are there any major differences among such models with respect to these capabilities? To answer these questions, we conducted an exploratory analysis by manually evaluating some of these Italian LLMs, organizing the study around criteria designed to quantify these specific aspects. This work closely aligns with a recent initiative that has been launched within the Italian NLP community, i.e., CALAMITA}, a campaign aimed at evaluating the capabilities of Italian (or multilingual, but including Italian) LLMs on specific tasks in zero or few-shot settings. Unlike the latter, however, our study relies solely on human judgments rather than automatic metrics. The main challenges of a manual approach include the absence of standardized practices and evaluation criteria AUTHOR, as well as the lack of systematic documentation AUTHOR, which hinders the reproducibility of such studies.} In light of these challenges, the intended contributions of this paper are outlined below: \item A small-scale human evaluation of several Italian LLMs on a specific task. \item The description of a protocol for human evaluation inspired by the good practices recommended in recent literature AUTHOR. To this end, we also make available the evaluation dataset, with the ratings assigned by the evaluators in a non-aggregated form. The remainder of this paper describes how this study was designed and carried out, with a discussion of the results obtained and the main limitations of the work.","This study provides an initial assessment of several Italian language models' ability to generate effective energy feedback. %The evaluation focused on three key dimensions—informativeness, comprehensibility, and accuracy—organized into five evaluation criteria. The results indicate that while the models generally perform well, particularly in terms of comprehensibility and accuracy, there is greater variability regarding informativeness. Among the tested models, results show that, except for LLaMAntino2-7B-UltraChat, the remaining ones provide comparable performances. However, it is important to highlight the limitations of this study. First, this is a small-scale study, as it involves a limited number of models and evaluators. Concerning the former issue, we also point out that the study was restricted to models available on HuggingFace, excluding potentially relevant models from external sources, such as Fauno} and Camoscio AUTHOR. A more systematic study should consider these models as well, in order to provide a more comprehensive evaluation over the Italian LLMs' landscape. As for the pool of evaluators, it is important to note a significant bias in both their personal backgrounds and demographics. All the judges have a background in computer science and varying degrees of familiarity with the topics at hand. Furthermore, there is a gender imbalance (1 female and 3 male judges) and a lack of age diversity, as all four judges fall within the 24–30 age range. In light of these considerations, a more systematic comparison as the one envisioned above would benefit from a broader and more diverse pool of evaluators. This would not only increase the reliability of the comparison but also provide a deeper understanding of potential correlations between socio-demographic factors, prior knowledge of technology and energy-related concepts, and the differing perceptions of the evaluation criteria considered in our study. Common approaches to address the lack of human participants include the use of crowdsourcing platforms, with a careful design of participation criteria that would ensure a better gender and demographic balance. Alternatively, a user study involving prospective users of the conversational agent could be conducted; this would ultimately enable to gather valuable insights on the type of feedback expected by the target audience. Finally, an extended evaluation framework should also include an analysis of the statistical power of the sample size to ensure more robust conclusions. Despite these limitations, this work offers a preliminary overview and aims to pave the way for future research on this aspect, also stressing the importance of more standardized human evaluation practices. As a matter of fact, the evaluation protocol we designed draws heavily from methodologies recommended in more general literature pertaining to human evaluation within generation and summarization tasks. Our approach thus aims to ensure that the core principles of the experiment are flexible enough to be easily replicated or adapted for a wider range of different domains.

Experiments to the Intersection Between NLP and Italian Linguistics,ENG,2,2,1,Università di Parma,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Parma,"Sentence splitting, that is the segmentation of the raw input text into sentences, is a fundamental step in text processing. Although it is considered a solved task for texts such as news articles and Wikipedia pages, the performance of systems can vary greatly depending on the text genre. This paper presents the evaluation of the performance of eight sentence splitting tools adopting different approaches (rule-based, supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning) on Italian 19th-century novels, a genre that has not received sufficient attention so far but which can be an interesting common ground between Natural Language Processing and Digital Humanities.","Sentence splitting is the process of segmenting a text into sentences. A sentence ends with a strong punctuation mark (e.g., full stop, question mark, or exclamation point) and is typically followed by a capital letter. The definition of sentence adopted here, which like any definition is inherently problematic, is motivated by the specific requirements of the present work, as will be seen below. by detecting their boundaries, which, at least for Western languages, including Italian, usually correspond to certain punctuation marks AUTHOR. This means that sentence splitting, for many languages, is a matter of punctuation disambiguation, that is, recognizing when a punctuation mark signals a sentence boundary or not. The importance of sentence splitting is often underestimated because it is considered an easy task, but its quality has a strong impact on the quality of subsequent text processing because errors can propagate reducing the performance of downstream tasks such as Syntactic Analysis AUTHOR, Machine Translation AUTHOR and Automatic Summarization AUTHOR. The most popular pipeline models, such as those of Stanza AUTHOR and spaCy}, have mostly been trained and evaluated on fairly formal texts, such as news articles and Wikipedia pages, so the publicly reported performances tend to be high, i.e. above 0.90 in terms of F1. However, the text genre has a significant impact on the results. For example, in the CoNLL 2018 shared task ``Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies'', the best system on the Italian ISDT treebank AUTHOR achieved a F1 of 0.99, while on the PoSTWITA treebank, made of tweets AUTHOR, the highest result was 0.66. Given these variations, considering less formal text genres could provide valuable insights into the challenges of sentence splitting. Among these genres are literary texts, which present unique and peculiar stylistic and creative features that can break traditional grammatical norms, including punctuation ones AUTHOR. These features depend on both authorial choices and the cultural context of the time. As a matter of facts, punctuation can vary significantly depending on the historical period; literary texts may follow prevailing trends or oppose them, giving rise to new trends. This phenomenon is particularly evident in 19th century, when the Italian usus punctandi began shifting from a primarily syntactic usage, prescribed by grammar books, to a communicative-textual usage of punctuation marks AUTHOR. Since this shift was probably influenced by the reflections and the practical uses of prominent authors such as Alessandro Manzoni AUTHOR, our study focuses on his historical novel, ``I Promessi Sposi''. The author paid meticulous attention to the punctuation of the text, revising it up to the final print proofs, and made specific and personal choices in collaboration with the publisher, alongside more classical ones AUTHOR. Although not always consistent, Manzoni's decisions make the novel particularly complex and interesting from a punctuation perspective. Furthermore, ``I Promessi Sposi'' has been a fundamental reference for the development of a common written Italian language: starting from this assumption, many of the author's punctuation choices have been adopted by later grammars for rule-making, though only some of them have become part of the standard. Given that punctuation was still undergoing standardization at the time, and that its use can depend not only on the conventions of the period but also on the writer’s personal style, the type of content being addressed (and how it is presented), and even the influence of typography during the printing process, we also decided to broaden our study to include sections from other novels contemporary to Manzoni’s (1840-42). Specifically, we analyzed ""I Malavoglia"" (1881) by Giovanni Verga, ""Le avventure di Pinocchio. Storia di un burattino"" (1883) by Carlo Collodi, and ""Cuore"" (1886) by Edmondo de Amicis. In this paper, our main contributions are as follows: (i) we provide an estimate of the performance of eight sentence splitting tools adopting different approaches on a specific and challenging text genre, namely historical literary fiction texts, which has not received enough attention so far; (ii) we compare the results considering the point of view of humanities scholars (in particular Italian linguistics) as the main stakeholders in the considered domain, in order to establish a flourishing cross-fertilization between NLP and Digital Humanities; (iii) we release manually split data for four 19th-century Italian novels and a shared notebook where to run many of the tested systems.","This paper presents an assessment of the performance of eight sentence splitting tools adopting different approaches on four 19th-century novels: ""I Promessi Sposi"" by Alessandro Manzoni, ""I Malavoglia"" by Giovanni Verga"", ""Le avventure di Pinocchio"" by Carlo Collodi, and ""Cuore"" by Edmondo de Amicis. Although these texts belong to the same historical period, they show specific features depending on the form and content of the novel as well as the author's stylistic choices. Among these features is punctuation, which in the late 19th century had not reached a detectable stability yet and was rather experiencing a paradigmatic change. Since sentence splitting for Western languages, including Italian, relies heavily on punctuation disambiguation, applying existing tools to the four novels considered has resulted in performances well below the standards. These texts demonstrate that sentence splitting is not a completely solved task. On the other hand, applying the model retrained on “I Promessi Sposi” to the other three novels showed significant improvements for “Le avventure di Pinocchio” and “I Malavoglia”, and a moderate improvement for “Cuore.” This result suggests that shared historical context and belonging to the same textual genre may offer sufficient similarities to improve the model's performance. However, the example of ""Cuore"" is evidence of how this is sometimes not enough: some specific features in form, punctuation and style continue to affect sentence splitting, demonstrating that although retraining may mitigate some problems, it does not completely overcome the inherent variability of these texts. Philologists have increasingly focused on preserving the original punctuation as a part of the author's creation of the text, providing valuable and reliable supports of study for scholars of linguistics and the history of the Italian language. Their combined knowledge is precious for achieving accurate sentence splitting in these texts. Thus, sentence splitting can be an interesting common ground between different disciplines, potentially leading to the development of tools for the automatic analysis of historical literary texts. This field remains under-explored in the Italian context, offering significant opportunities for further study and cross-disciplinary collaboration.

However, studies in the Italian context are still limited. This work therefore aims to advance the state of the art in the field of emotion analysis applied to historical texts by proposing a new dataset and describing the results of a set of emotion polarity detection experiments. The text analyzed is ``I Promessi Sposi'' in its final edition (published in 1840), one of the most important novels in the Italian literary and linguistic canon.","Emotions play a key role in literature, representing a bridge between the author's purposes, the text, and the reader's personal background: literature collects experiences and contains the emotions that accompany them, in turn generating new experiences and new emotions. Therefore, studying emotions in literary texts implies the possibility of providing valuable insights into the deeper meanings and intentions behind a work, the form it may take, and the readers' engagement with it. This field of study has recently experienced a flourishing national and international development involving different disciplines, from literary criticism to philosophy, from anthropology to psychology. For example, in the Italian context, Ginzburg et al. AUTHOR analyzed how Matte Blanco's psychoanalytic theories on emotions are applied to literary criticism, taking into account authors like Tozzi, Pirandello, and Svevo, while Guaragnella AUTHOR explored the complex interaction between humor and sadness in 20th-century Italian literature from a both philosophical and literary point of view. However, some literary works remained under-explored. One such work is Alessandro Manzoni's ``I Promessi Sposi''. Despite its emotional richness, the novel has often been regarded as monolithic and static, both because of the narrated events, strongly influenced by the author's religious spirit and social and political polemic, and because it quickly became a model of the Italian language, stably included in school curricula as mandatory study material. This has led to a certain degree of reluctance and lack of enthusiasm among the readers. As a consequence, a study of emotions in ``I Promessi Sposi'' can be beneficial from both an academic and educational standpoint. Academically, it can provide new insights into a classic text, encouraging new interpretations and scholarly discussions. For didactic purposes, analyzing the emotions in ``I Promessi Sposi'' can make the novel more relatable and appealing for students, revealing the depth and complexity of the characters' experiences in the context in which they live, and encouraging a closer connection with them and with Manzoni's social issues. Given this context, computational methods, already widely applied especially on user-generated contents (such as reviews and social media posts), can be profitably tested on the fictional text after developing specific datasets for training and evaluating new models. The present work takes as a basis a preliminary annotation of the Manzoni's novel, expanding the number of manually labeled sentences and proposing the development of some models of varying complexity. More specifically, two are the main contributions of our work: i) we release} a new dataset made of more than 3.000 sentences taken from ``I Promessi Sposi'' manually annotated with four emotion polarity classes (i.e. POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, MIXED); ii) we test various approaches for emotion polarity detection using the new dataset as-is but also augmenting it with other annotated Italian resources.","This paper presents a new manually annotated dataset and a set of experiments for the automatic detection of emotion polarity. More specifically, the dataset contains 3,095 sentences taken from ``I Promessi Sposi'' and the experiments cover different approaches, namely lexicon-based, SVC and the fine-tuning of an Italian BERT model and of the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa model. The impact of the training set size is also evaluated by increasing the in-domain dataset by combining other annotated Italian resources. We are aware that for the emotion analysis task, as for all NLP tasks, Large Language Models are now widely used AUTHOR but these require computational powers currently not available to the authors of the paper. In the future, our work will focus on this aspect in order to be in line with the current state of the art. Another future work will concern the annotation of emotions with more granular labels, extending an activity already started on Chapter VIII only, on which the label scheme proposed for the GoEmotions dataset AUTHOR was applied AUTHOR. Additionally, we plan to pay greater attention to the annotation of irony, a crucial aspect of the novel. This could be incorporated into the dataset using a binary 0/1 value to indicate its presence or absence, as we have already begun to implement }. Finally, we would like to explore the applications of our work in the school context. Concerning the study of emotions in Manzoni's novel, computational methods and tools could provide inputs and data useful for didactic practical activities, such as visual representations of affective scenes, role-playing exercises, or even crowd-sourced annotation that allows students to express their personal interpretations of the characters' emotions in different chapters and situations. Activities like these can make the whole learning experience more dynamic and captivating, promoting a deeper connection between the students and the novel and, meanwhile, improving their critical thinking and empathy.

This corpus aims to fill a gap in the resources available for the historical pragmatics of Italian. First, we describe the annotation scheme, which is structured into four levels covering a wide range of pragmatic (or pragmatically relevant) categories: speech acts (e.g., apology; threat), forms (e.g., discourse marker; expressive), pragmatic functions (which are speaker-oriented, e.g., mitigation; turn-taking), and pragmatic aims (which are interlocutor-oriented, e.g., attention-getting; request for agreement). We then discuss how the results of an initial annotation exercise provide insights for refining the annotation procedure.","The DIADIta project1, situated within the framework of historical pragmatics [1], aims to investigate the specific pragmatic features and strategies of dialogic interaction in different phases of the Italian language, and to understand how these features and strategies interrelate with one another and change over time. Although the last fifteen years have witnessed a growing interest in the historical pragmatics of Italian [2], there is still a lack of an in-depth study on this topic, one that is able to fully account for how different communicative strategies and different linguistic categories (primarily, but not exclusively, pragmatic) interact with each other, both in synchronic and diachronic perspective. The DIADIta project aims to address this gap. A key goal of the project is to build a diachronic corpus annotated for a wide range of pragmatically relevant linguistic phenomena. The DIADIta corpus, which will contribute to the recently established field of diachronic corpus pragmatics [3], will consist of at least 24 Italian literary texts of different genres dating from the 13th to the 20th century: in most cases, plays, novels and short stories where dialogic interactions between characters are particularly frequent. Once completed, the corpus will be freely accessible and searchable from the project website (www.diadita.it) and will be possibly further expanded and enriched with other texts of different literary genres. In this paper, we present the first steps we have taken to lay the foundation for the DIADIta corpus. After a brief review of related literature and resources (Section 2), we describe the structure of the annotation scheme, outlining the theoretical and methodological assumptions that underlie it and highlighting its most innovative aspects (Section 3). Then, we present the results of an annotation exercise on a play by Luigi Pirandello, with which we tested the reliability of the scheme. In the light of these results, we also briefly discuss some improvements that we plan to apply in the next stages of the corpus annotation process (Section 4). The last section draws the conclusions of the study (Section 5).","This paper has outlined the initial steps in creating the DIADIta corpus, a pragmatically annotated diachronic corpus for Italian. This corpus is characterized by its rich, multi-layered annotation scheme organized into four dimensions: forms, pragmatic functions, pragmatic aims, speech acts. This structure allows for nuanced analysis of pragmatic strategies in literary texts from the 13th to the 20th century. The innovative approach of annotating complex interactional features highlights the value of this corpus as an unparalleled tool for examining the evolution of pragmatic functions and forms over time, enabling detailed and multi-dimensional analysis of text data. We have also detailed an annotation exercise on a play by Pirandello that illustrates the task’s complexity (reflected in the low level of agreement in some layers), but also the richness of the annotations. This first exercise is crucial for refining the annotation process and improving clarity and reliability in applying a pragmatic annotation model to historical texts.",13,Multimodal

However, detecting hate speech, particularly in the complex linguistic environments of social media, presents significant challenges due to slang, sarcasm, and neologisms. State-of-the-art methods like Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong contextual understanding, but they often require prohibitive computational resources. To address this, we propose two solutions: (1) a bidirectional long short-term memory network with an attention mechanism (AT-BiLSTM) to enhance the model's interpretability and natural language understanding, and (2) fine-tuned multilingual robustly optimized BERT (XLM-RoBERTa) models.\\ Building on the promising results from EVALITA campaigns in hate speech detection, we develop robust classifiers to analyse 20.4 million Tweets related to migrants and ethnic minorities. Further, we utilise an additional custom labeled dataset (IstatHate) for benchmarking and training and we show how its inclusion can improve classification performance. Our best model outperforms top entries from previous EVALITA campaigns. Finally, we introduce Hate Speech Indices (HSI), which capture the dynamics of hate speech over time, and assess whether their main peaks correlate with major events.","Social media platforms provide a fertile ground for the dissemination of hate speech, particularly targeting vulnerable groups such as migrants and ethnic minorities. In the last decade, hateful speech on platforms like X has become a pressing issue, as it not only affects the individuals who are directly targeted, but also contributes to a climate of hostility and division. Detecting hate speech in social media content is crucial to analyse the safety and inclusivity of online platforms and social environments. Hate speech detection is inherently challenging due to the subtle and evolving nature of social media language. Tweets often contain slang, neologisms, and sarcasm, which complicates the identification process. Traditional text classification methods usually fall short in addressing these challenges, especially for non-English languages where extensively labeled training sets are not easy to gather, calling for the development of more sophisticated approaches. The topic of hate speech detection in Italian texts has gained significant attention within the natural language processing (NLP) community, as shown by the HaSpeeDe (Hate Speech Detection) tasks at EVALITA. For instance, the EVALITA 2018 AUTHOR, and 2020 AUTHOR campaigns have provided labeled datasets and attracted several submissions employing a diverse set of machine learning and deep learning techniques. A prominent approach in recent hate speech detection and, in general, text classification, is the use of pre-trained language models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) AUTHOR. After their first appearance in 2018, BERT-based models have set new standards in several NLP tasks thanks to their ability to capture contextual information effectively, especially when fine-tuned on the specific task of interest. In 2019, a multilingual robustly optimized BERT (XLM-RoBERTa) AUTHOR was published, making it possible to obtain higher performances on non-English texts. For instance, TheNorth team for the HaSpeeDe 2 task at EVALITA 2020 obtained the best results fine-tuning a XLM-RoBERTa model AUTHOR. It is also worth noting that in recent years, generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an even more impressive ability to understand natural language. However, their large number of parameters makes them impractical for classifying large volumes of data, even when compared to the larger version of XLM-RoBERTa\footnote{The number of parameters in Large Language Models ranges between a few billions to hundreds of billions of parameters, while the large version of XLM-RoBERTa “only” has 561 million parameters. . Given these developments and challenges, our research proposes two approaches to hate speech classification: (1) an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory network (AT-BiLSTM), benchmarked against a standard BiLSTM model, and (2) a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa (large) model, benchmarked against its base, smaller version. We use two labeled training sets: (a) the EVALITA 2020 HaSpeeDe 2 task dataset, and (b) a custom, smaller labeled dataset, which we refer to as IstatHate. Our study explores the impact of training models on both the EVALITA dataset alone and a combined dataset that includes EVALITA and IstatHate, evaluating their performance across multiple test sets. Finally, we present a preliminary version of the Hate Speech Index (HSI), designed to quantify the proportion of hate speech by classifying 20.4 million Italian Tweets related to migrants and ethnic minorities from January 2018 to February 2023.","This study addressed the issue of hate speech detection on social media, specifically focusing on X (formerly Twitter) and on migrants and ethnic minorities. Given the complexities of natural language on these platforms, we explored different approaches including lighter bidirectional LSTM models with and without attention mechanisms, and fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa models both in their base and large formats. We trained our models on EVALITA 2020 HaSpeeDe 2 data and also introduced a small labeled dataset, IstatHate, that improves the performance of the already best performing model, XLM-RoBERTa-large, when included in the training set. Despite longer inference times and higher computational resources required for large amounts of data, heavier models like XLM-RoBERTa-large achieve significantly higher performance and generalization capabilities. Yet, AT-BiLSTM\star (i.e., the AT-BiLSTM model that includes both EVALITA and IstatHate data in the training), outperforms XLM-RoBERTa-base\star across all test sets, a notable achievement considering the difference in models size and inference time. We compared the predictions of AT-BiLSTM-EV against AT-BiLSTM\star visualising the attention scores they assigned to the same Tweets. Empirical evidence shows that including IstatHate in the training set may improve contextual understanding and mitigate the bias that simpler models like LSTMs may have when classifying hate speech in the presence of curse words. The preliminary computation of the Hate Speech Index (HSI) reveals significantly different levels of hate speech detection across different models and training sets, even though the training data has very similar characteristics. Fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa models produce the lower estimates in levels, especially when IstatHate is included in the training set. Furthermore, when analysing hate peaks, XLM-RoBERTa-large\star predictions highly correlate with major events. Future work will focus on expanding and validating the IstatHate dataset, exploiting the sampling weights, refining model architectures, and exploring additional features to enhance detection capabilities. \newpage \appendix",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

We present Task-oriented Human Attention Video Question Answering (THAVQA), a new VQA dataset consisting of third- and first- person videos of an instructor using a sewing machine. The sewing task is formalized step-by-step in a script: each step consists of a video annotated with German language open-ended question and answer (QA) pairs and with human visual attention. %This data collection is the first step toward a larger goal: to have an AI assistant help the user solve the task by answering questions about how to properly use the sewing machine. The paper also includes a first assessment of the performance of a pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) in generating answers to the questions of our dataset across different experimental settings. Results show that our task-oriented dataset is challenging for pre-trained models. Specifically, the model struggles to answer questions requiring technical knowledge or spatio-temporal reasoning. %%Model performance improves when it has as input text that contains the specific technical knowledge.","This paper presents a new VQA dataset based on demonstrating basic sewing machine operations.To our knowledge, THAVQA,which is also annotated with human visual attention, is the first task-oriented VQA dataset in German language. The dataset building is a first step in the larger project aimed at developing an AI-assistant for a sewing machine workshop held at the Technische Hochschule Augsburg. This AI-assistant would support students when using sewing machines for the first time. For example, this could mean answering questions about basic machine settings or explaining fundamental sewing skills. Our dataset poses unique challenges for VQA models and is almost unique in the state-of-the-art VQA datasets since it is user- and task-oriented: the questions collected are those that a real user would ask for help while using the sewing machine. The process of operating the sewing machine was decomposed in a script into steps and sub-steps that were recorded and on which questions and answers were annotated. Specialized knowledge of the process and understanding of spatial and temporal relationships is required for answering the questions collected. In addition, the limited visual variety of the video scenes and the specialized language and dictionary challenge the models for VQA. Annotating human attention in the video inputs of VQA models has recently been shown to improve their performance in user- and task-oriented datasets. In our dataset, the workshop instructor's eye gaze has been used as a proxy for human visual attention. The concept behind it is that visual human attention integrated as input into models for VQA can help the model distinguish between video frames, especially in datasets in which recorded scenes are very similar to each other as there are few participants and staged events. Our paper also provides a first assessment of the VQA performance of the pre-trained MLLM Gemini 1.5 Pro on THAVQA. Indeed, new releases of LLMs, such as Gemini 1.5 but also GPT-4, Llama 2, or Claude 3, now allow for visual inputs, making it possible to perform VQA tasks using pre-trained models directly. To sum up, this paper presents: A new dataset with third-person videos of an instructor operating a sewing machine and first-person videos annotated with visual human attention, QA pairs in German, and a script in German of the steps required to operate the machine. An evaluation of the performance of a pre-trained MLLM on generating open-ended answers from questions and videos of our dataset.","We provide a new task-oriented, German-language VQA dataset on demonstrations of sewing machine operation with open-ended human QA pairs and human visual attention: THAVQA. We then compared the VQA performance of Gemini 1.5 Pro on THAVQA varying the model inputs. We found that the task-oriented scenario of THAVQA was specific enough, such that the model could not rely on only its inherent knowledge to generate satisfactory responses. The questions contained in our dataset were over the capacity of the model to reason about the video data. Combining textual instructions with a first person video resulted in the best performing model across all reasoning types of questions. When looking towards the design of a VQA model for a future, practical sewing machine assistant, video inputs could therefore be used mainly to improve the model's perception abilities, while a retrieval system for textual information could provide the necessary specialized knowledge.",1,Language Models

This work explores the role of current Natural Language Processing methods to reduce its negative impact. To do so, a novel Italian dataset is generated, containing manual annotations for classification, spoiling, and neutralisation of clickbait. Besides, several experimental evaluations are performed, assessing the performance of current language models. On the one hand, we evaluate the performance in the task of clickbait detection in a multilingual setting, showing that augmenting the data with English instances largely improves overall performance. On the other hand, the generation tasks of clickbait spoiling and neutralisation are explored. The latter is a novel task, designed to increase the informativeness of a headline, thus removing the information gap. This work opens a new research avenue that has been largely uncharted in the Italian language.","Accuracy and truthfulness are essential characteristics of journalism. Nevertheless, in an effort to improve revenue, a large number of newspapers and magazines publish clickbait articles, a viral journalism strategy that seeks to attract users to click on a link to a page through tactics such as sensationalist stories and catchy headlines that act as bait. The use of these tactics harms the quality of news pieces and thus hinders the ability of citizens to obtain reliable and objective information. The literature distinguishes between two main types of clickbait. (i) Classical clickbait AUTHOR embeds within the headlines information gaps, also known as curiosity gaps AUTHOR, in order to arouse curiosity in the reader that is forced to access the article's content which is ultimately disappointing. Classical clickbait usually makes use of hyperbolic language, caps lock, demonstrative pronouns and superlative to grasp the user's attention AUTHOR. (ii) Deceptive clickbait AUTHOR refers to headlines that resemble traditional media headlines by offering a summary of the article, still leading to content that differs from the reader's expectations. These headlines promise high news value but deliver content with low news value, resulting in reader disappointment. Although clickbait headlines are considered one of the less harmful forms of fake news, as their main goal is to increase profit by driving traffic to their website AUTHOR, they can sometimes pose a danger, especially when they deal with potentially harmful topics such as health and science. To address this problem, Natural Language Processing techniques have been widely employed to detect clickbait headlines, with a particular focus on the English language AUTHOR. \citet{hagen-etal-2022-clickbait} proposed the clickbait spoiling task, i.e., the generation of a short text that satisfies the curiosity induced by a clickbait post. In light of this, this work addresses the issue of clickbait in the Italian language, studying its characteristics and the possibilities of current technology to reduce its negative impact. In doing so, we have generated a novel Italian dataset that gathers a large collection of clickbait articles, which is made public for the community to use~}. We named the dataset ClickBaIT. This dataset contains manually annotated instances as clickbait/non-clickbait, as well as manually generated spoilers and neutralised headlines. We have also performed a thorough multilingual evaluation, exploiting the availability of English data to complement our dataset in the task of clickbait detection. Finally, this work also explores the use of our annotated dataset and large language models to automatically generate both spoilers and, as a novel task, a neutralised version of clickbait headlines.

The dataset includes news articles that have been manually annotated to indicate the presence of clickbait, spoilers associated with clickbait headlines, and their respective neutral headlines. The experiments explore the effectiveness of current NLP methods for the modelling of clickbait headlines in Italian through ClickBaIT. The evaluation for clickbait detection shows how training data can be augmented in a multilingual setting, which leads to classification improvements that are in line with previous research AUTHOR. The generation experiments, for both spoiling and neutralisation, evidence that the evaluated model does benefit from in-domain knowledge extracted from the proposed dataset. As seen, these informed generations are more accurate and align better with the golden text. Considering the effect of clickbait, we argue that while there are initially harmless articles, lack of accuracy can have a detrimental effect on readers. This is clear when considering certain sensitive domains such as health. Thus, we hope that this work facilitates future research on the topic for example, by addressing the link between clickbait and misinformation, considering both in a unified framework.",15,Fact Checking and Fake News Detection

Users found in the online environment new modes of representation to express various types of hatred, including the more deeply rooted ideologies and beliefs with historical origins, for example towards women AUTHOR.\\ Detecting abusive language has become an increasingly important task. The challenges introduced by the new modes of representation, which require a multimodal analysis, are further compounded when considering the subjectivity of the task. The subjectivity of the task derives from the fact that individuals' perception of what characterizes a message of hate varies widely. Such diversification is reflected in the labeling phase in the form of disagreement among annotators. Identifying elements within the sample that can lead to disagreement is of paramount importance for several reasons. For content that can lead to disagreement, specific annotation policies might be introduced, and the number of annotators might be enlarged to capture multiple perspectives AUTHOR. \\ In this work, we propose a methodology to identify the disagreement-related elements in multimodal samples by exploring both visual and textual elements in the Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification (MAMI) dataset AUTHOR. Moreover, four different strategies to exploit the presence of such elements in the identification of disagreement are investigated.","This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to identify disagreement-related elements in multimodal content. The proposed approach allows for the identification of elements that could be used as a proxy to identify samples that might be perceived differently by the annotators, and therefore, that could lead to disagreement. Achieved results highlight the difficulty of the task, denoting the need for a more advanced approach. Future work will include different strategies for image analysis in order to provide a better description of the image itself in all the elements that compose it. Furthermore, a study of the compositionality might be carried out to better represent the relationship among such elements inside the meme. The sense of a meme is often derived from the meanings of its individual parts (i.e. the image and text) and the way they are combined. By analyzing how different elements interact and contribute to the overall message, it is possible to gain a deeper understanding of how the meaning is represented within the different modalities. This will help in identifying complex patterns and improve the accuracy of classification models.

Several Natural Language Processing (NLP) studies, concerning Hate Speech directed against women, have focused on misogynistic behaviours, slurs or incel communities. The main contribution of our work is the creation of the first dataset on social media comments to GBV, in particular to a femicide event. Our dataset, named GBV-Maltesi, contains 2,934 YouTube comments annotated following a new schema that we developed in order to study GBV and misogyny with an intersectional approach. During the experimental phase, we trained models on different corpora for binary misogyny detection and found that datasets that mostly include explicit expressions of misogyny are an easier challenge, compared to more implicit forms of misogyny contained in GBV-Maltesi. \noindent \textbf{Warning}: This paper contains examples of offensive content.","Nowadays, the term Gender Based Violence (GBV) is used to identify all forms of abuse based on gender hatred and sexist discrimination AUTHOR. Scholars in social science have defined as ``rape culture'' the society that normalizes sexist behaviours: from more common occurrences like victim blaming, slut shaming and gender pay gap %at the base, through catcalling, stalking, stealthing, to the apex of violence with femicide AUTHOR. While general violent crimes decreased over time, GBV did not, alarming various bodies in modern society}. A report from the EU commission} states that 31%, 5% and 43% of European women suffered respectively from physical, sexual and psychological violence. Regarding the Internet sphere, a survey found that 73% of women journalists experienced online violence (threats, belittling, shaming,...) AUTHOR. These statistics become even more alarming when we consider studies that show the correlation between misogynistic online posts and GBV AUTHOR. \\ Like other countries, Italy is affected by GBV, with the national observatory managed by the ``Non Una di Meno'' association reporting 117 femicides in 2022, 120 in 2023 and more than 40 until June 2024}. Several studies about Hate Speech (HS) directed towards women often focus on developing taxonomies AUTHOR rather than investigating low resource subjects in computational linguistics like GBV. These works often gather corpora by keyword search of gender slurs AUTHOR, retrieving comments left on misogynistic spaces like incel blogs AUTHOR or considering messages directed towards %controversial popular women figures highly debated on social media AUTHOR. As GBV is a broad topic, we want to clarify that we focus on GBV in Western societies, particularly in Italy. The main goal of this project is to show what is the current perception of femicides expressed through comments on social media, focusing on the specific case of Carol Maltesi. We chose this femicide because the victim was a sex worker, meaning that she presented an intersectional trait, and it was a popular case in the media, enabling us to select enough material for the study. Further, we want to highlight how the socio-demographic characteristics of the victims determine the way they are described and how this influences the perception of the news. For instance, victim's features such as age, job, origin, skin color, nationality, religion have different weight and determine the lesser or greater spread of the news AUTHOR. To overcome the cited issues in current literature, in this research we considered the phenomenon by focusing on users' reactions in social media to news about femicides. We collected YouTube comments in response to videos talking about a specific case. In order to overcome the constraints of traditional sentiment analysis schemas, we annotated the data following a new semantic grid that can be used as a standard for comments regarding GBV. In the experimental phase of this work, we created models based on different Italian misogyny datasets (including ours). The goal of such experiments is to analyze the different features of these corpora and what forms of misogyny are harder to detect. We performed both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results. In the next sections, we describe: related work on hate speech and misogyny detection(Section sec:Related), the annotation scheme and both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the dataset (Section sec:Dataset), and the results obtained in our experiments (Section sec:Experiments). Lastly, we present some conclusions and delineate possible future developments (Section sec:conclusions).","In this paper, we presented GBV-Maltesi which is the first dataset regarding social reactions to GBV, in particular to a femicide case. The topic was chosen to shed light on the importance of having misogyny corpora that include forms of sexism that are more implicit and complicated to detect compared to the existing ones that focus on slurs and offensive terms. We also focused on the intersectionality aspects to better explore online hate. GBV-Maltesi is composed of 2,934 comments all annotated by 5 annotators and it is available at . In order to overcome limitations of generic semantic schema, the corpus has been annotated following a new schema specifically created for cases of GBV. In the experimental phase of our work, we created different misogyny binary classifiers and tested them in a cross-dataset way. We found that datasets gathered on keyword collection are easier benchmarks as the model showed bias towards slurs and not identifying more implicit cases of misogyny. This research on online discourse about GBV is not meant to be exhaustive, as several questions are still open. As future works, we intend to focus on how different framing of news can cause different online reactions, analyzing the differences between video transcripts of femicide news and the comments collected, in terms of words used, implicit references, attributions of guilt and descriptions of the people involved in the story. We also intend to gather more annotated corpora regarding femicides to explore how other characteristics of the victim (e.g., origin or skin color) and time of the murder differently influence the online reactions. In this regard, we intend to explore the question by investigating whether and how the discourse on misogyny changes depending on whether it is addressed to living or dead women (i.e., Giulia Cecchettin femicide and abusive discourse against her sister, Elena Cecchettin). Lastly, we would like to extend our research by following an intersectional approach, considering all the dimensions and characteristics that make up the identity of both victim and perpetrator. To conclude, we strongly advocate the importance of write the news correctly, as this has deep consequences on the readers' perception and the way they talk about it.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

As an alternative to fine-tuning, we explore the potential of activation steering-based techniques to enhance model performance on Italian tasks. Through our experiments we show that Italian steering (i) can be successfully applied to different models, (ii) achieves performances comparable to, or even better than, fine-tuned models for Italian, and (iii) yields higher quality and consistency in Italian generations. We also discuss the utility of steering and fine-tuning in the contemporary LLM landscape where models are anyway getting high Italian performances even if not explicitly trained in this language.","The strong rise in capabilities of the latest large language models (LLMs) has brought significant improvements in a wide variety of downstream tasks. These abilities mainly derive from the instruction-tuning procedure (IT), i.e., model fine-tuning on instruction datasets, and enable the models to follow user-prompted instructions. Most LLMs, however, are mainly pre-trained and fine-tuned in English, and while other high-resource languages are included in the training data, they are not present to the extent needed to achieve out-of-the-box performances comparable to English. A strategy to address this has been, in the past few years, to fine-tune models with language-specific instructions, such as the Stanford Alpaca dataset AUTHOR, which has been automatically translated in multiple languages -- the Italian version of it has been used to train the Llama~2-based Camoscio model AUTHOR. A combination of \sim 240K training instances from three automatically translated instruction datasets was used to train the latest Llamantino AUTHOR, the most recent Llama~3-based instruction-tuned model for Italian. This approach has proven effective, but using large amounts of machine-translated texts is far from optimal: although the translation is generally good for high-resource languages, the language's unique linguistic and cultural aspects are often not represented by the training data. In addition, one must consider the usual substantial (computational) costs associated with large datasets. With recent developments in interpretability research, new approaches are arising to localize and steer different language model aspects. These techniques mainly work with an inference-time injection, allowing for targeted interventions during the generation phase without incurring the high costs associated with any additional training. Such techniques, relying on the assumption that models are already capable of performing specific tasks, aim at enhancing some of the internal activations leading to specific solutions, thereby also increasing overall performance. They have proved successful towards specific tasks, such as model detoxification, but also toward more generalist and wide-ranging tasks AUTHOR. We explore the potential of steering for Italian-instructing a pre-trained LLM as an alternative to fine-tuning, adopting a steering technique based on contrastive examples. We observe that this approach, with much less data~( \ll 100 instances instead of 240K) and no additional training required, enables performances comparable to standard fine-tuning approaches and yields high-quality Italian generations.","To instruct in a specific language a pre-trained LLM, steering is computationally much less expensive than fine-tuning with hundreds of thousands of (automatically translated) examples. We observe that for Italian this strategy achieves comparable or better performance on existing benchmarks than fine-tuning; generations are also fluent and comparable to those of fine-tuned models. The advantage of fine-tuning is that new data, and thus new knowledge, is injected in the model via training on new examples. At the same time, this might also trigger so-called catastrophic forgetting, yielding degradation in the output. We suggest that in the context of creating a new language-specific instructed LLM, this advantage makes sense only insofar culturally relevant and native data is used in the fine-tuning phase, so that the model can truly be enriched with language-specific knowledge, both grammatically and pragmatically. If translated data must be used, then it is incredibly more effective to use steering which requires much fewer examples (less than 0.5%) and a simple inference-time injection, making this an accessible method for virtually any language. Using native examples for the steering procedure, and possibly style-specific examples, might also yield interesting results.",1,Language Models

While general-purpose systems such as LLaMA-3 and GPT-4o perform poorly on this task, ad-hoc fine-tuning seems to improve models' performance. However, we find that performance gains from training are largely motivated by memorization. Our results suggest that rebus solving remains a challenging test bed to evaluate large language models' linguistic proficiency and sequential instruction-following skills.","Complex games such as chess and Go have long been a source of inspiration to develop more flexible and robust AI systems AUTHOR. Recent developments in NLP suggested that creative language games could be exploited as promising benchmarks for quantifying the ability of large language models (LLMs) to carry out multi-step knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks under pre-specified constraints AUTHOR. While crossword puzzles have been historically the main focus of such efforts AUTHOR, other categories of linguistic games received only marginal attention, especially for languages other than English. A prominent example of less-studied language games is the rebus, a visual puzzle combining images and graphic signs to encode a hidden phrase. Indeed, rebus solving is a complex, multi-step process requiring factual knowledge, contextual understanding, vocabulary usage, and reasoning within pre-defined constraints -- a set of fundamental skills to address a variety of real-world tasks. In this work, we conduct the first open evaluation of LLMs' rebus-solving capabilities, focusing specifically on the Italian language. We propose a novel strategy to derive text-only verbalized rebuses from transcribed intermediate rebus solutions and use it to produce a large collection with more than 80k verbalized rebuses. We then evaluate the rebus-solving skills of state-of-the-art LLMs, including open-source systems and proprietary models, via few-shot prompting. Moreover, we fine-tune a small but capable LLM on verbalized rebus solving, outperforming state-of-the-art systems by a wide margin. Finally, we conduct a fine-grained assessment of LLMs' sequential reasoning steps, explaining model performance in terms of word complexity and memorization. Beyond rebus solving, our evaluation sheds light on the limits of current LLMs in multi-step reasoning settings, highlighting challenges with their application to complex sequential instruction-following scenarios.{Github} and \href{https://huggingface.co/collections/gsarti/verbalized-rebus-clic-it-2024-66ab8f11cb04e68bdf4fb028}{Huggingface}","This work introduced a verbalized rebus-solving task and dataset for evaluating LLMs' sequential instruction following skills for the Italian language. We crafted a large collection of 83k verbalized rebuses by combining rebus transcriptions with crossword definitions and used it to evaluate the rebus-solving skills of state-of-the-art LLMs. Our experiments revealed the challenging nature of this task, with even the most capable prompted models achieving only 24% accuracy on solutions. While fine-tuning a smaller LLM dramatically improved performance to 51% solution accuracy, our analysis uncovered that these gains were largely driven by memorization and do not generalize to out-of-distribution examples. These results suggest important limitations in the generalization capabilities of current systems for sequential instruction following tasks. Our manual analysis further shows that LLMs seldom account for length constraints when solving definitions, despite the fundamental role of these cues in restricting the pool of possible words. These results suggest that search-based approaches accounting for constraints more explicitly might improve puzzle structure adherence, as previously shown by~\citet{crossword-mcts}. Other augmentation techniques employing LLM reformulation skills can also be explored to mitigate overfitting. Future work in this area should focus on expanding similar evaluations to a wider set of languages, input modalities, and puzzle categories, creating a comprehensive benchmark to test LLMs' puzzle-solving skills. Importantly, the task of solving visual rebuses and their more convoluted variants) or dynamic relations derived from multi-scene analysis (stereorebus)} remains far beyond the current capabilities of vision-language models. Hence, solving these puzzles automatically can be considered an important milestone in developing multimodal AI systems for constrained multi-step reasoning tasks. Our results confirm that the challenging nature of rebuses, even in their verbalized form, makes this task valuable for assessing future progress in LLMs' linguistic proficiency and sequential reasoning abilities. Finally, our rebus-solving LLM can facilitate future interpretability work investigating the mechanisms behind factual recall and multi-step reasoning in transformer models AUTHOR. \paragraph{Limitations Our analysis was limited to a relatively small set of models, and a single prompt template obtained after minimal tuning.

Still, it needs a further development in analyzing some discourse phenomena that also undergo deterioration, and can help expand our understanding of dementia-related speech and refine automatic tools. This paper explores the discourse property of cohesion by investigating three types of cohesive devices: reference, lexical iteration, and connectives. Ten features related to these categories have been defined and automatically extracted from an Italian corpus of semi-spontaneous speech collected from dementia patients and healthy controls. Some of the designed features have proven significant for the binary classification of the two groups and further quantitative analysis highlight interesting differences in the use of cohesive devices, that seem to be associated with cognitive decline.","Linguistics deficits commonly characterized neurodegenerative diseases from their onset. In Dementia, or Major Neurocognitive Disorder (DSM-5 AUTHOR), a syndrome of acquired and progressive impairment in cognitive function that interfere with independence in everyday life, language deterioration manifests itself within a broader framework of cognitive impairment, which could affects memory, visuo-spatial skills, executive functions and reasoning. Deficits both in verbal production and comprehension have been observed, despite the specificity of different Dementia's etiological subtypes, among which the most common is Alzheimer's Disease (AD), characterized with a primary impairment in episodic memory. In AD, for example, among the well-established linguistic deficits there are word-finding problems, which include anomia, the production of semantic paraphasias AUTHOR and the ""on the-tip-of-the tongue"" experience AUTHOR, low speech rate, poor word comprehension AUTHOR and, as the disease worsen, a generalized simplification of syntax AUTHOR. Also discourse and pragmatic level is affected by cognitive decline. Errors in referential cohesion has been registered, in particular regarding ambiguous use of pronouns AUTHOR. Coherence is compromised, especially in spontaneous speech: the discourse appears with an abundance of irrelevant details and the overt difficulty to mention the key concept or to refer to the topic, resulting in a lack of informativeness in communication AUTHOR. In recent years, speech analysis in cognitive decline has gained increasing importance in the development of low-cost and portable tools for dementia screening, also supported by the remarkable advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies AUTHOR. The refinement of classification systems goes hand in hand with the operationalization of linguistic features computed from oral productions, that need to be adapted to different languages. Regarding Italian, the OPLON (OPportunities for active and healthy LONgevity) [2014-2016] project was devoted to the automatic extraction of an extensive group of linguistic features from acoustic, rhythmic, readability, lexical, morpho-syntactic and syntactic levels, from a speech corpus of cognitively impaired patients and healthy peers AUTHOR. Analysis of the significance of the features highlighted that the acoustics ones largely correlated with the cognitive state of the subjects AUTHOR. Expanding the list of language levels covered to include speech properties would enrich the features used for classification and, in addition, could broaden our understanding of how cognitive decline manifests itself in verbal competence. Nevertheless, defining specific features of higher-level and complex phenomena is not trivial. Drawing inspiration from works that propose a ""stratified"" approach to discourse analysis, which individually considers macro-phenomena that intersect with one another AUTHOR, this paper will examine cohesion, the property of the superficial form of the text to reflect its internal unity AUTHOR. Cohesion assures continuity in discourse through a network of cohesive devices, which are mainly words or morphemes, that contribute to maintain semantic relations occurring in the text AUTHOR. Therefore, we proposed a method to design and formalize a set of cohesion features, with the aim of observing whether they contribute to discriminate the speech of individuals with dementia from healthy peers. Specifically, three types of elements, which Halliday \& Hasan AUTHOR indicate among the major contributors to cohesion, were taken into consideration: reference, lexical iteration and connectives. The implementation of measures based on cohesive devices is the first step towards the attempt to include discourse properties in the automatic analysis of language in cognitive decline. The study of their interaction with features of other linguistic levels is crucial to observe whether they have a positive impact on discrimination between dementia subjects and healthy subjects. The work presented in this paper, therefore, has to be intended as a preliminary analysis that will serve to pursue more sophisticated ML classification in the future.","In this work, we present a methodology for delineating linguistic features of cohesion to track and study changes in discourse properties in the speech of individuals with cognitive impairment compared to healthy peers. The research focused on three types of cohesive devices, i.e., reference, lexical iteration, and connectives, that were automatically extracted from a Italian corpus of semi-spontaneous speech from dementia subjects and controls, collected in Basilicata. Statistical significance for binary discrimination was computed applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and then adjusting the results with Bonferroni's method. The test shows that a feature of the repetitions of lemmas and the one related to the set of cohesive devices jointly considered contribute to distinguish the two groups. Moreover, the quantitative distribution of the cohesive devices reveals differences in the use of elements within the considered categories between PG and CG, which seem to highlight a general deterioration in discursive competencies associated with dementia. The results obtained provide a preliminary basis for further study of discourse properties in cognitive decline, with the aim of expanding the set of linguistic features that can be automatically extracted to other levels of language. This expansion is intended to refine digital systems that could be employed as support for the early diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases, potentially improving timely interventions for patients and their caregivers.",13,Multimodal

In this study, we applied an annotation schema from the literature designed to formalize implicit stereotypes. We analyzed implicit stereotypes about immigrants in two datasets: StereoHoax-IT and SterheoSchool, which are created from different sources. StereoHoax-IT consists of reactions on Twitter to specific hoaxes aimed at discriminating against immigrants, while SterheoSchool includes comments from teenagers on fake news generated in psychological experiments. We describe the annotation process, annotator disagreements, and provide both quantitative and qualitative analyses to shed light on how implicitness characterizes stereotypes in different texts. Our findings suggest that implicit stereotypes are often conveyed through logical linguistic relations, such as entailment and behavioral evaluations of immigrants.","Various recent NLP studies have focused on detecting stereotypes online, often in conjunction with forms of abusive language AUTHOR. The importance of tackling this phenomenon is due to its impact on social structures and the power of individuals. Therefore, detecting stereotypes can prevent their emergence and spread, and thereby have a positive impact on our society. In social psychology, a stereotype has been defined as a set of beliefs about others perceived as belonging to a different social group AUTHOR. It oversimplifies the features of the group and generalizes a particular feature, applying it to all its members AUTHOR. In contrast to the emotional component of prejudice and the behavioral component of discrimination, a stereotype is associated with the cognitive component of the triad AUTHOR. In language, stereotypes can be expressed explicitly or implicitly AUTHOR. Explicit stereotypes deliver a straightforward message, clearly revealing the associated traits, often using derogatory adjectives AUTHOR. In contrast, implicit stereotypes are more nuanced and indirect, requiring the reader to infer their meaning AUTHOR. These implicit stereotypes can be communicated through linguistic devices such as metaphor and irony AUTHOR, negation AUTHOR, or entailments AUTHOR. Recently, efforts have been made to formalize the strategies for expressing implicit stereotypes, with the goal of establishing standardized criteria for annotators AUTHOR. An example of explicit stereotype is ""{[Gli immigrati] buttano via il cibo che gli danno per poi andare a mangiare i poveri cani, dove finiremo!""} } (extracted from StereoHoax-IT corpus), in which the generalization of the target group and the association with an action is expressed in a present tense with a habitual aspect. On the other hand, in the example ""{Come noi rispettiamo loro e il colore della loro pelle, così loro che abitano nei nostri paesi dovrebbero portare rispetto nei nostri confronti.""} } (SterheoSchool corpus), the stereotype is not overtly manifested, but it must be inferred through the evaluation of the in-group and an exhortative sentence. From a computational linguistics perspective, concerns have been raised about how to detect and process stereotypes, a task often considered closely related to the detection of abusive language or hate speech AUTHOR. \\ Alongside research on hate speech, the study of stereotype detection has increased, particularly within evaluation tasks AUTHOR. However, the detection of implicit stereotypes remains a significant challenge AUTHOR. There are several works that deal with stereotypes in more complex narratives, such as microportraits AUTHOR and political debates AUTHOR. The detection of implicitness has also been studied with reference to several other phenomena, in particular those characterized by subjectivity, such as irony AUTHOR. In this paper, we analyze the implicit manifestation of stereotypes targeting immigrants, using a well-defined annotation schema proposed by \citet{schmeisser2022criteria} and tested on a subset of comments from Spanish newspapers (DETESTS AUTHOR). This schema represents different criteria for determining the implicitness of stereotypes in an attempt to formalize the concept. Disentangling strategies of implicitness presents a significant challenge, often resulting in the identification of multiple categories within the same text. Our main contributions consist of expanding the annotation with topics of stereotypes about immigrants AUTHOR and the strategies to implicitness AUTHOR, as well as testing this schema on two existing Italian datasets. These datasets share the same domain as those used for Spanish, stereotypes about immigrants, and include data extracted from Twitter (now X) as reactions to specific hoaxes (StereoHoax-IT) and comments written by high school students to two examples of fake news artificially created within psychological experiments (SterheoSchool) as described in AUTHOR. Analyzing the annotated texts, we noted that implicit stereotypes appear to be conveyed especially through logical linguistic relations like entailment and the behavioral evaluation of immigrants in both datasets. Moreover, in most cases, the annotators needed to use contextual information to determine the presence of stereotypes. For example, in this case ""{Che centra lui e Italiano!, può essere massacrato!}"" } (StereoHoax-IT) the author of the message expresses a stereotype complaining that foreigners enjoy better treatment than Italians, who can indeed be ""macellati"" (slaughtered). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sections~sec:datasets and~sec:annotation describe the datasets and the annotation applied; Sections~sec:statistics and~sec:qualitative present quantitative and qualitative analyses of the annotated data; and Section~sec:conclusions summarizes the results and provides guidance regarding future work.","In this paper, we applied an annotation scheme for analyzing the implicitness of stereotypes against immigrants according to two main dimensions (i.e., topics and strategies for making the content implicit) to the Italian StereoHoax-IT and SterheoSchool corpora. Adding these two layers of annotation allowed us to observe that annotators need to use contextual information to determine the presence of stereotypes especially, when specific strategies have been used by the author of the message (irony/sarcasm, extrapolation, entailment/evaluation, and imperative/exhortative). Moreover, implicit stereotypes appear to be conveyed mainly through logical linguistic relations such as the entailment and behavioral evaluation of immigrants and, in fewer cases, via `imperative/exhortative', `irony/sarcasm' and `extrapolation.' As future work, we plan to perform a comparative analysis with the datasets in Spanish, which have already been annotated with this schema, in order to understand cultural analogies and differences in portraying immigrants as threats, enemies or victims.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

This study aims to evaluate the understanding of negation in Italian \url{bert}- and \url{robert}-based models, contrasting the predominant English-focused prior research. We develop the SCIN Set, an Italian dataset designed to model the influence of polarity constraints on models in a masked predictions task. Applying the SCIN Set reveals that these models do not adjust their behaviour based on sentences polarity, even when the resulting sentence is contradictory. We conclude that the tested models lack a clear understanding of how negation alters sentence meaning.","Compositionality is a fundamental feature of human language, based on the principle that the meaning of a complex expression derives from its parts and their respective arrangements. One notable compositional phenomenon is negation, formally defined as a semantic operator (or function) that reverses the truth-value of a sentence AUTHOR. Given its importance, understanding how well pretrained language models (PLMs) can grasp and apply this principle is crucial. These models achieve impressive performance across a wide array of language modeling tasks. Nonetheless, they often reveal to rely on shallow heuristics or exhibit other issues in handling specific aspects of language. A prominent bias in the body of research is that the vast majority of research on language models has predominantly concentrated on English. this focus raises concerns about the generalizability of findings to other languages which may be structurally different from English. Conducting similar experiments in other languages could provide valuable context and material for comparison, potentially highlighting language-specific effects or revealing new generalization. Therefore, we decide to undertake a new experiment focusing on Italian negation. Thus, in this article, we aim to explore whether the behavior of PLMs accurately models the polarity of sentences. We will investigate how the addition of negation to a sentence can alter its overall meaning (demonstrating the models’ capability to handle shifts in meaning due to structural changes). Given the limitations explained above, our work has deliberately chosen to concentrate on Italian. This choice not only addresses the need to explore how these models perform with languages other than English but also serves as a critical test for PLMs dedicated to Italian. We suspect that these models may not be as advanced or effective as their English counterparts, highlighting the need for further developments outside English. We adapt the test set developed for English by AUTHOR to Italian, creating the Self-Contained Italian Neg Set (SCIN Set). Using the dataset to evaluate BERT- and ROBERTA-based models for Italian, we find that these models are unable to adjust their prediction in response to constraints posed by negation, often generating contradictory text.","In this paper, we investigated the ability of several Italian PLMs to take negation into account in their predictions. To do this, we adapted to Italian the proposed by AUTHOR, which is based on minimal pairs of aligned sentences. Applying this test to six models enabled us to show that negation modifies their predictions, but that this does not happen consistently or in a way that is always coherent with the semantic effect that we expect negation to have on sentences. These results suggest a strong need to adapt these models to make them more sensitive to negation and its semantic consequences. Nevertheless, we also noted a fairly marked difference in performance from one model to another, correlated with the different corpora used to train them. We thus suggest that a lexical and statistical study of these corpora could shed further light on the behavior of the models. Lastly, it would be interesting to compare these results with the performance of generative models, in order to study the relative importance of the number of model parameters in relation to their architecture.",1,Language Models

While various XAI techniques, especially feature attribution methods, have been extensively explored across diverse tasks, their adaptation for the \textit{speech} modality is comparatively lagging behind. We argue that a key challenge in feature attribution for speech processing lies in identifying informative acoustic features. In this paper, we discuss the key challenges in selecting the features for speech explanations. Also, in light of existing research, we highlight current gaps and propose future avenues to enhance the depth and informativeness of explanations for speech.","Spoken language, as perhaps our most natural form of interaction, is the foundational element of many technologies we interact with in our daily lives, from virtual assistants to voice dictation. More recently, the emergence of highly capable speech foundation models has facilitated and expanded the adoption of speech technologies on an unprecedented multilingual scale. In light of this proliferation, a need arises to prioritize transparency and interpretability, qualities already demanded in the growing landscape of Machine Learning (ML). As a response, the field of eXplainable AI (XAI) has risen prominently, with the aim of facilitating understanding of the rationale behind model decisions and fostering users' trust. XAI is also reinforced by the establishment of norms and legal frameworks, as seen in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which enshrines the ""right to explanation,"" and the AI Act, which emphasizes transparency as a pivotal component of ML applications. XAI encompasses various tasks and methods, such as identifying relevant model components for specific predictions, understanding the information processed by these components, and determining which input elements guide the model's predictions. The latter task is the focus of feature attribution methods, which provide intuitive explanations by visualizing which input elements (e.g., pixels in an image or words in a sentence) have influenced the model’s predictions. These methods assign a score to each input feature, quantifying its importance or contribution to the output: higher scores indicate greater importance of the corresponding input features for generating the output. They can help identify potential causes for errors and unexpected behaviors, as well as analyze the model’s response to specific input properties. Overall, these explainability methods serve to present the reason why models make specific predictions by establishing a connection between input and output as a form of intuitive explanation for humans, thereby enhancing interpretability. Despite numerous efforts to differentiate the closely related concepts of explainability and interpretability, no consensus exists in the literature on their definitions. In this paper, we adopt a perspective where explainability refers to the process of extracting insights from a model's workings through specific techniques, while interpretability refers to the understanding process of those insights, crucial to make them actionable. Over time, ongoing efforts have aimed to refine feature attribution techniques and provide more effective explanations. However, it is essential to recognize that the effectiveness of feature attribution explanations relies not only on the techniques themselves but also on the informativeness of the input features used as explanatory variables. If an explanation highlights unintelligible or poorly informative features, it does little to enhance the understanding of the model's behavior. This can undermine key principles in XAI, such as accuracy—the property of correctly reflecting the factors that led the model to a specific decision, including all relevant information—and meaningfulness—the property of offering explanations that are comprehensible to the user. In fields involving images or texts, feature representations are typically constrained to pixels and words, respectively. However, for speech, multiple input representations can be adopted, each emphasizing different acoustic aspects. Indeed, a sequence of speech elements not only conveys the meaning of what is said (like words in a text) but also bears a wealth of additional information useful for both human understanding and automatic processing (e.g., intonation, loudness, speaking rate). Consequently, when employing feature attribution methods, the resulting explanations can vary significantly in shape and focus on more or less informative characteristics depending on the type of speech representation used. To date, research on feature attribution for speech is notably limited to few applications, including classification and generative tasks, which offer a somewhat fragmented picture in the choice of speech representations, thus providing limited insights on the relation between the features considered and the explanations based upon them. In light of the above, this paper reflects on the impact of the chosen acoustic features in explaining the rationale behind speech models, aiming to gain a deeper understanding of the trade-offs associated with acoustic features. By first offering a gentle introduction to the rich and multidimensional nature of speech and its digital representation, we identify current gaps and potential avenues for effectively incorporating this multidimensionality into XAI for speech models. Our discussion will focus on two critical factors: i) the amount of information these features provide about the model's behavior, which influences the richness of the explanations, and ii) the level of detail of such information, which determines the granularity of the explanations. We will also explore how these aspects impact both the accuracy and meaningfulness of the explanations, ultimately shaping their overall interpretability.","This paper has examined the role of acoustic features and their selection for explaining speech models.More specifically, we considered a specific subfield of XAI, namely, feature attribution, which connects input features to outputs as a form of explanation. Previous research has not explicitly addressed how to incorporate features into the explanation process within the speech domain, where input is encoded in more varied ways compared to other fields, such as text.This has led to diverse approaches, each with different implications for what can and cannot be explained about model behavior, and with the risk of not fully or accurately representing the model's functioning. By discussing the key characteristics of speech and the properties of the most adopted acoustic features, we argue that explanations should ideally encompass all available dimensions, particularly time and frequency, as both are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the models' rationale. We have also discussed challenges associated with aligning explanations at high granularity with human understanding, emphasizing solutions that provide flexibility in the analysis, allowing for adjustments between more or less detail as needed.Building on these insights, our ongoing research focuses on developing feature attribution techniques that operate on spectrograms at the finest possible unit level, integrating both time and frequency dimensions. Our aim is to generate explanations that are accurate and meaningful for experts, as well as adaptable for non-expert users. More broadly, we hope that our reflections will be beneficial and thought-provoking for researchers currently working in, or entering, the field of XAI for speech models, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the rationale behind these models.",13,Multimodal

IDRE comprises typical chatbot user utterances in the healthcare domain, corresponding chatbot responses, and empathetically enhanced chatbot responses. The dataset was generated using the Llama2 language model and evaluated by human raters based on predefined metrics. The IDRE dataset offers a comprehensive and realistic collection of Italian chatbot-user interactions suitable for training and refining chatbot models in the healthcare domain. This facilitates the development of chatbots capable of natural and productive conversations with healthcare users. Notably, the dataset incorporates empathetically enhanced chatbot responses, enabling researchers to investigate the effects of empathetic language on fostering more positive and engaging human-machine interactions within healthcare settings. The methodology employed for the construction of the IDRE dataset can be extended to generate sentences in additional languages and domains, thereby expanding its applicability and utility. The IDRE dataset is publicly available for research purposes.","Emotional intelligence has been widely recognized as a crucial factor influencing human communication, impacting aspects such as behavioral choices and the interpretation of information [1]. Consequently, there has been a growing interest in developing chatbots capable of exhibiting empathetic responses [2] [3] [4]. While significant strides have been made in this direction, the integration of empathy into commercial chatbots remains challenging due to the rigid constraints imposed by business rules such as the response must not lose the original meaning and the dialogue must maintain structure. To address this limitation, one possible approach is to build a layer that rephrases the bot's response by increasing empathy without altering the structure or meaning of the underlying dialogue. This strategy offers the potential to enhance user experience and create a foundation for more sophisticated empathetic dialogue systems. To facilitate the development of such systems, a robust dataset containing empathetic responses is essential. Despite the increasing body of research on emotion recognition and generation in human-computer interaction, there is a notable absence of publicly available datasets specifically focused on empathy in chatbot interactions. This paper introduces the IDRE dataset, a new Italian language resource comprising human-bot interactions within the healthcare domain. The dataset is available publicly, and the address is provided in the Online Resource section. The dataset includes the user questions, original bot responses and corresponding empathetic reformulations for a total of 480 sentences, providing a valuable foundation for research and development in empathetic chatbot technology, see Table 1 for an example. The paper also elaborates on the methodology employed for dataset generation, highlighting its applicability to diverse domains and languages.","In this work, we have presented the creation of a dataset of sentences representing typical interactions with a healthcare chatbot. The dataset includes both user input sentences and empathetic responses generated by the chatbot. Human validation has confirmed the quality and usefulness of the dataset for developing and evaluating empathetic chatbots in the healthcare domain. This work presents a two-pronged contribution to the field of empathetic chatbots, specifically focusing on the Italian language. Firstly, it addresses the critical issue of data scarcity by providing a high-quality, annotated dataset for training and evaluating empathetic chatbots within a healthcare context. This dataset can be employed to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) such as Llama2, enabling them to generate responses with demonstrably enhanced empathetic qualities. The limitations of non-fine-tuned models are exemplified through the observation that they can produce factually incorrect or unempathetic sentences (e.g., "" Il tuo corpo è vulnerabile al rischio del tumore al seno a causa della tua età avanzata, nonostante la tua vitalità e forza interiori. La storia familiare di tumori al seno nella tua famiglia e la tua condizione di obesità possono aumentare il rischio, come pure l'abuso di tabacco e alcool. Inoltre, la tua scelta di non avere figli o di averli dopo l'età di 35 anni può aggiungere ulteriore rischio al tuo corpo.""). By leveraging the proposed dataset and selecting sentences with demonstrably high empathy scores, a targeted training set can be constructed specifically for this purpose. This, in turn, allows for the fine-tuning of the LLM, significantly improving its ability to generate empathetic responses in a healthcare setting. Secondly, the work contributes a rigorous human validation methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of empathy expression in chatbots. This methodology provides a valuable tool for researchers and developers working in this domain.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

Both are classified with respect to ESCO occupations, and match if they align with the same occupation and the same skills assigned to the occupation. However, matching models usually struggle with the classification because of overlapping skills and similar definitions of occupations defined in the ESCO taxonomy. This often leads to imprecise classification outcomes. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of the classification of job postings written in Italian or Spanish against ESCO occupations written in English. We experiment with multilingual embeddings, zero-shot classification, and use of a large language model (LLM) and show that the use of an LLM leads to best results. Furthermore, we also explore an alternative automatic labeling method by prompting three top-performing LLMs to annotate the test dataset. This approach serves both as an experiment on the usability of automatic labeling and as an evaluation of the reliability of the automatically assigned labels, involving human annotators.","The modern labour market becomes more and more diverse. High-tech jobs demand novel skills and competences, which in their turn keep undergoing adaptations and modifications. Under these circumstances, accurately classifying job postings and CVs of job seekers (henceforth candidate experiences) that contain detailed technological specifications with remarkably similar yet distinct skills and experiences has evolved into a complex challenge. The overwhelming majority of job portals and employment agencies use either the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy or its US equivalent O*Net taxonomy} to classify job postings and candidate experiences in terms of job title labeled ESCO/O*Net occupations. Most of the proposals to automatic alignment of job postings with candidate experiences (or vice versa) also use ESCO or O*Net AUTHOR. %but they often do so indirectly by first classifying both the postings and the applications against the occupations and their skills in the chosen taxonomy and then matching the obtained ESCO/O*Net labels. Typically, they also leverage some of the additional information provided in the taxonomy, such as skills, competences, and qualifications -- although, e.g., \citet{yamashita2022james} focus solely on job (i.e., occupation) titles and then incorporate job transition trajectories and historical experiences, including start and end dates, from the job application. However, despite their wide use, both ESCO and O*Net taxonomies exhibit principle limitations for the task of automatic classification of job postings and candidate experiences because due to their tree structure they often fail to adequately distinguish between occupations that exhibit substantial skill overlaps. For instance, two job postings labeled as `data analyst' may appear similar but require different skills if one focuses on market research while the other concentrates on healthcare trends analysis. This issue is particularly pronounced when classification relies on a single label, such as the job title of an ESCO occupation, where skill overlaps undermine precise classification. Hence, employing multiple job titles and framing the problem as a multi-label classification task is imperative. %Although ESCO provides very detailed definitions, any classification method that does not incorporate these comprehensive descriptions, essential skills, and synonyms will miss critical details, rendering effective differentiation between occupations unattainable. This paper addresses the challenge of multilingual multi-label classification using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the alignment of Italian and Spanish job postings with English job titles encountered in the ESCO taxonomy. Multilingual class embeddings are explored to improve classification accuracy, aiming to provide the necessary contextual awareness and addressing the core limitations of taxonomies such as ESCO. %Classifying job postings with respect to ESCO job titles / occupations enables a recommendation system where similarly classified job postings are suggested to recruiters and job seekers. Furthermore, we explore an alternative automatic labeling method by prompting three top-performing LLMs to annotate the test dataset. This approach serves both as an experiment on the usability of automatic labeling and as an evaluation of the reliability of the automatically assigned labels, involving human annotators. To provide LLMs with domain-specific information and to mitigate hallucinations in the course of the classification of the job postings, we employ Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AUTHOR, which combines information retrieval with a generative model. RAG serves two critical functions in our methodology. Firstly, it provides detailed definitions, including essential skills and synonyms for each ESCO occupation, selected through vector similarity as outlined in AUTHOR. Secondly, it ensures that the assigned job titles are restricted to titles within our predefined label space, i.e., standardized job titles defined in the ESCO taxonomy. %In other words, we propose augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with ESCO occupations as external knowledge sources, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as an in-context learning approach, specifically through learning by analogy AUTHOR, for job posting classification. Our model incorporates job titles from the ESCO taxonomy as labels and selects an appropriate job title for each job posting in our dataset. \hmt{that was in English and scores were higher there, should we remove the following? The contributions of our work are: \bullet We explore the impact of using multilingual class embeddings derived from the ESCO taxonomy for the task of job posting classification.\\ \bullet We integrate RAG to provide LLMs with domain-specific information and eliminate the dependency on fine-tuning;\\ \bullet We show how the LLM response can be restricted to standardized job titles and thus how LLMs can be used for high quality job title classification that outperforms state-of-the-art proposals for this task. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section sec:rel-work, we present a concise overview of the related work. In Section sec:model, the model on which our work is based is outlined. Section sec:experiments describes the experiments we carried out, the results we obtained in these experiments, and their discussion. In Section sec:concls, finally, draws some conclusions from the presented work and outlines some directions for future research. In Appendix sec:abl, we present an ablation study in which we assess the comprehension of English ESCO job titles and its Spanish equivalents by our model. Appendix sec:postings provides, for illustration, examples of Italian job postings and predicted ESCO job titles. In Appendix sec:prompts, we present the signature used to prompt Large Language Models for pre-processing.","In this paper, we argued that the use of multilingual embeddings in combination with LLMs significantly enhances our ability to distinguish between very similar (or even identical) job titles that suggest different skills and competencies. Our experiments have shown that this is indeed the case, demonstrating that the combination of multilingual text embeddings similarity with the Llama-3 markedly exceeds the performance of other leading approaches in the field. In the future, we plan to apply the same approach to the analysis and classification of job candidate experiences. Once it is ensured that both job postings and candidate experiences can accurately be modeled using the embedded representation of the ESCO taxonomy, we plan to set the stage for a more direct and efficient alignment process between job postings and experiences of job seekers. Another interesting direction for future research is to analyze the lexical overlap between English domain-specific terms that appear in Italian and Spanish job postings and the English occupation descriptions in the ESCO taxonomy. Such an analysis would reveal whether job types with higher lexical overlap affect model accuracy, providing deeper insights into the multilingual nature of the task. \appendix",21,Gender and Inclusive Language Studies

This paper presents \FMNews, a new dataset of articles reporting femicides extracted from Italian newspapers. Our core contribution aims to promote the development of a deeper framing and awareness of the phenomenon through an original resource available and accessible to the research community, facilitating further analyses on the topic. The paper also provides a preliminary study of the resulting collection through several example use cases and scenarios.","How newspapers and journalists present news plays a crucial role in shaping public understanding and perception of information. This is especially important when reporting serious crimes, such as femicides, where descriptions of the perpetrator and victim can create polarized opinions influencing readers' perceptions and interpretations of the event. According to Bouzerdan (2018), news media often report incidents of women’s homicides in a sensationalised manner, treating these crimes as isolated events rather than situating them within the bigger framework of violence against women. This narrative defies the global demands of human rights organisations to acknowledge and address this phenomenon as demanded by its intricate dynamics. Numerous countries have followed such recommendations only partially through the formal adoption of specific terminology such as femicide and feminicide in legal frameworks and public discourse. The two terms have related but distinct nuances of meaning. Femicide, a criminological concept initially coined in English by the feminist criminologist Diana H. Russell (Radford and Russell, 1992), denotes the murder of women by males due to their gender. Successively, the term femicide, translated in Castilian as femicidio or feminicide by the anthropologist Marcela Lagarde to attract political attention to the dire situation faced by women in Mexico (Lagarde, 2006), has gained global traction with varying interpretations. Yet, it consistently denotes a patriarchal impetus behind homicides and other forms of male violence against women, primarily emphasizing the sociological dimensions of abuse and the socio-political ramifications of the phenomenon. In the Italian language, the term femminicidio has been almost exclusively adopted, as evidenced by a Google Trends analysis comparing the search terms ""femicidio"" and ""femminicidio"" to queries regarding ""femicide."" An analysis of the phenomenon of femicide in the Italian context and, in particular, a linguistic investigation of it, are particularly relevant. Feminicide, a term used by the feminist movement in Italy since 2005, gained prominence in the media in 2011, especially thanks to the works of Barbara Spinelli (Spinelli, 2008). The CEDAW Committee, based on data from the Shadow Report on the Implementation of CEDAW in Italy, addressed recommendations to the Italian government on feminicide in its Concluding Observations. This was the first time the committee addressed a European state on feminicide, a category previously reserved for warnings to Central American countries. The challenges in accurately contextualising feminicide in Italy also stem from a prolonged absence of official data, resulting in sensationalism and the perception of a dramatic rise in the crime. This may induce an emergency narrative that obscures the inherent structural dimensions of the phenomenon, thereby undermining the very essence of the term (Spinelli, 2012). Media interpretations are essential for shaping a shared understanding across a vast audience, such as a whole country; hence, the examination of media discourse emerges as a significant analytical instrument on top of statistical evaluation of femicide data to understand the achievements and directions of state intervention towards the substantial granting of women's right to life (Abis, 2016). In this regard, Aldrete (2023) showed that there is a large body of empirical studies on femicide discourse across different socio-cultural contexts, which often justify the perpetrator's actions. Given the complexity of the phenomenon, a comprehensive investigation could be achieved by integrating media analysis with external data, such as demographics and current events, blending together researchers from different fields like computer science, social sciences, and complex systems science. The lack of accessible and relevant data specific to socio-cultural contexts where femicide is notably prevalent, such as in Italy, makes the task particularly challenging (Forciniti, 2023). This paper presents \FMNews, a new dataset of articles reporting femicides extracted from Italian newspapers. We conduct a preliminary analysis of the resulting collection through several example use cases and scenarios. The primary contribution is to deepen understanding and awareness of femicide from a socio-technical perspective. We seek to examine how prominent Italian news sources report on the issue in connection to the shaping of public perception, while also offering an innovative and accessible resource to facilitate future investigation within the research community. Furthermore, this study was designed to enable a multifaceted investigation covering the following three dimensions: Geographical, with the aim to explore potential variations in framing between local and national media outlets. Previous research has shown that Italian local daily newspapers often suppress the agency of the perpetrator, portraying the events as mere occurrences. We selected newspapers reporting news at both the national (e.g., Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica, La Stampa, Il Fatto Quotidiano, Il Giornale, and Il Post) and local levels, with local editions spanning across the whole Italian territory. Political, ensured by choosing national newspapers with varying political leanings. Temporal, where the time frame of national newspapers extends from November 2009 to February 2024, whilst that of the local ones ranges from November 2010 to February 2024.","In this contribution, we provided a novel dataset concerning the critical issue of femicide in Italy. Considering the absence of resources for conducting in-depth analyses on the subject, our intent was to bridge this gap and provide an original perspective for understanding and raising awareness about this severe phenomenon. As suggested by AUTHOR proposing a contribution within the Machine Learning domain responsibly and consciously means foremost acknowledging our own biases. In particular, we are referring to both the newspaper selection and choice of the terms used to extract the data, that certainly shaped the results (all design choices are justified in detail in Section dataset. A future outlook concerns the investigation of how both victims and perpetrators are framed from a linguistic perspective. Further analyses could regard identifying temporal and geographical patterns arising from media attention manifested through the coverage of femicides and comparing the framing of these events with the political leaning of the respective newspapers.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Our backgrounds fields are theoretical linguistics, computer science and NLP.","In recent years, social networks have become the primary means of communication for most people. With the daily growth of online interactions, it has become urgent to recognize and prevent the spread of offensive messages against different target groups based on gender, sex, sexual orientation, race, religion, language, or political orientation. Moreover, categorizing hate speech with clear-cut boundaries is overly simplistic, as it includes various forms of abusive language that imply disrespect and hostility. A recent challenge is finding a balance between detecting hate speech and preserving the free spread of ideas and opinions on the web, while promoting inclusive and fair language. Thiago et al. (2021) AUTHOR highlighted how automated analysis can misinterpret context, risking the censorship of marginalized groups languages, such as those of the LGBT+ community. Another study by Pamungkas and colleagues (2020) AUTHOR emphasized the importance of considering context in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks to avoid misinterpretations of word meanings, noting that the same swear word can be used both abusively and non-abusively. An example of this phenomenon is the semantic reappropriation, a practice in which terms historically used as slurs against a specific target group lose their offensive intent in certain contexts, by expressing a sense of belonging and solidarity within the group members AUTHOR. Although community visibility and the use of specific slang have been approached for years, to our knowledge only some hate speech studies specifically addressed slurs, and few focused on slurs semantic reappropriation AUTHOR. Nowadays, recognizing this kind of semantic shift through NLP tools is crucial to avoid the risk of removing not abusive speech in online contents, which could paradoxically harm marginalized users AUTHOR. Our study is the first with the aim of investigating reappropriative use of slurs in Italian, highlighting the need to take a step ahead from the existing abusive language detection models. Having in mind the capability of LLMs in classification task, we leveraged a LLM with a zero-shot approach in order to recognize the presence of reappropriative uses in our dataset. This study makes the following contributions: \item We partially revised the original annotation previously conducted on the HODI dataset (Homotransphobic Dataset in Italian) AUTHOR, by developing new annotation guidelines. \item We used a LLM specifically fine-tuned on Italian language by leveraging prompt engineering. \item From a linguistic point of view, we showed why certain features of the Italian language make this task particularly challenging.

Finally, in the last Section sec:Conclusion we draw conclusions of the current research.","This paper presents the first attempt to specifically address the detection of slur reappropriation in the Italian language. One of the reasons that motivated us to undertake this task is the need to ensure a safe linguistic environment on social networks without risking the censorship of individual freedom of expression. Since there was no existing dataset to explore homophobic slurs in the Italian language, we filtered a pre-existing homotransphobic dataset to build a subset containing only tweets with slurs occurrences, used both abusively and non-abusively. We then designed precise new guidelines and annotated the filtered subset, focusing on the presence of slur semantic reappropriation. With the newly annotated dataset, we approached a classification task using LLMs with zero-shot techniques. Leveraging the Qwen model AUTHOR, we proposed four different prompts. As suggested by previous literature, more specific prompts and those better suited to the dataset yielded better performance. In this work, we proposed an important and under-explored task through a two-fold contribution. On one hand, we highlighted the lack of data in the Italian language dealing with this phenomenon and the necessity of building an up-to-date corpus that comprehensively includes multiple sources and semantic contexts. On the other hand, we demonstrated a possible approach by leveraging new state-of-the-art LLMs. Finally, it is important to have in mind that compared to English, Italian has a different history and cultural background, resulting in a much slower linguistic evolution. This makes establishing precise characteristics of this topic a challenging task due to the lack of solid foundational knowledge. In conclusion, we believe that bringing attention to the issue will lead to anti-discrimination activities, the creation of safer spaces in online communication, and the inclusion and acceptance of LGBT+ communities. \clearpage \appendix",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

It allows for the estimation of lexical, contextual, and higher-level structural effects on word identification through metrics such as fixation duration. Despite advancements in psycholinguistic experiments that have elucidated these effects, the extent to which computational models can predict gaze patterns remains unclear. Recent developments in computational modeling, particularly the use of pre-trained transformer language models, have shown promising results in mirroring human reading behaviors. However, previous studies have not adequately compared these models to alternative architectures or considered various input features comprehensively. This paper addresses these gaps by replicating prior findings on English data, critically evaluating performance metrics, and proposing a stricter accuracy measurement method. Furthermore, it compares different computational models, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve results comparable to or better than transformers. The study also emphasizes the significance of individual differences in reading behavior, presenting challenges for simulating natural reading tasks.","Eye-tracking data recorded while reading connected text offers valuable insights into the cognitive processes involved in language comprehension. For example, by looking at fixation duration it is possible to estimate the effects that lexical properties (e.g. length, frequencies, orthographic similarity AUTHOR AUTHOR), contextual constraints (e.g. predictability AUTHOR) and higher-level structures (e.g. syntactic structure or prosodic contour AUTHOR) can exert on word identification. While psycholinguistic experiments have reliably assessed how such effects modulate - either linearly or non-linearly - reading times, it is not clear to which extent computational models can directly predict behavioral metrics such as gaze patterns. Over the past 30 years, research in this field has advanced significantly, leading to the development of sophisticated architectures that can account for many aspects of eye movement behavior during reading (e.g. EZ-Reader AUTHOR, Swift AUTHOR). A great boost in such improvements came from the collection and release of eye-tracking corpora (e.g. Geco AUTHOR, Zuco AUTHOR, Meco AUTHOR) which allowed for deep learning techniques to be applied in prediction tasks of eye tracking metrics. Recent work AUTHOR used fine-tuned pre-trained transformer language models achieving remarkably accurate predictions of a wide range of eye-tracking features related to both early and late stages of lexical access. According to such results, these models would accurately mirror the average human reading behavior, suggesting that transformers inherently encode the relative importance of language elements similarly to human cognitive processing mechanisms. However, the authors did not make a direct comparison with alternative computational architectures (e.g. recurrent neural network) and alternative input features (e.g. word length, frequency, predictability, part-of-speech among others), but rather referred to previous literature to support their claim. In the current paper, we directly addressed this issue by replicating the results from AUTHOR on the English data. We critically evaluated the metrics used to assess models' performance and provided an alternative, stricter way to measure accuracy. Next, we tested a comprehensive set of different models on the same task, showing how simpler architectures can achieve comparable or even better results than transformers. Finally, we discussed the overall results in terms of group-level vs individual-level behavior, highlighting the importance of individual differences and how they represent a tough challenge when running simulations of natural reading tasks.","Transformer-based neural networks appear to reasonably predict fixation probability and first-pass duration of words in human reading of English connected texts. Our present investigation basically supports this conclusion, while providing new evidence on two related questions. Two questions naturally arise in this context. How accurate are transformer-based predictions compared with the best predictions of other neural network classifiers trained on the same task? How cognitively plausible are the mechanisms underpinning this performance? Here, we addressed both questions by testing various models on the task of predicting human reading measurements from the GECO corpus, using different evaluation metrics and regressing network predictions on a few linguistic factors that are known to account for human reading behaviour. Our first observation is that assessing a network's performance by looking at its MAE loss function provides a rather gross evaluation of the effective power of a neural network simulating human reading behaviour. A baseline model assigning each token a constant gaze duration that equals the average of all FPD values attested in GECO achieves a 95.7\% loss-based accuracy on both test and training data.\ That a transformer-based classification scores 97.2\% on the same metric and the same test data cannot be held, as such, as a sign of outstanding performance. In fact, it turns out that the MAE loss function is blind to both the magnitude of a network error, and possible biases in the prediction of very low\slash high target values. Thus, it provides an inflated estimate of a model's accuracy. %, to the extent that even the baseline \textit{const} model reached an accuracy of 95\%. We suggest that binary evaluation metrics, based on a fixed threshold partially overcome these limitations. Yet, as single word fixation times typically range between tens to hundreds of milliseconds, application of a fixed threshold will differently affect tokens with different fixation times. We conclude that a relative threshold based on each word's fixation time is a fairer way to measure prediction accuracy. Clearly, this comes at a cost. When assessed with a relative threshold, the accuracy of a transformer-based architecture on test data drops from 70\% down to 57.8\%. It turned out that all other network models tested for the present purposes showed accuracy levels that are comparable to the accuracy of a transformer-based architecture. Since the former are trained on a more restricted set of lexical and contextual input features than the latter, this seems to suggest that word embeddings are of limited use in the task at hand. Although fine-tuned word embeddings actually appear to score much higher on training data (even using accT and accS), we observe that this is due to data overfitting, as clearly shown by the considerably poorer performance of the fine-tuned model on test data. An analysis of the psychometric plausibility of the gaze patterns simulated with our neural models reveals that a relatively small set of linguistic factors that are known to account for a sizeable amount of variance in human fixation times can also account for the bulk of variance in models' behaviour. This is relatively unsurprising, as most of these models were trained on input features that encode at least some of these factors. Nonetheless, we believe that the result is interesting for at least two reasons. First, it shows a promising convergence between computational metrics of model accuracy and quantitative models of psychometric assessment.\ Secondly, it suggests that one can gain non trivial insights in a model's behaviour by analysing to what extent the behaviour is sensitive to the same linguistic factors human readers are known to be sensitive to. On the one hand, this is a step towards understanding what information a neural model is actually learning and putting to use for the task. On the other hand, this is instrumental in developing better models, as it shows what type of input information is more needed to successfully carry out a task, at least if one is trying to simulate the way the same task is carried out by speakers. In the end, it may well be the case that a 70\% fixed-threshold accuracy in simulating average gaze patterns in human reading is not as disappointing as it might seem. Given the wide variability in human reading behaviour (and even in a single reader when confronted with different texts), a considerable amount of variance in our data may simply be accounted for by by-subject (or by-token) random effects.",1,Language Models

In a previous work, we developed an approach to study the diachrony of complex expressions, namely literary metaphors. Capitalizing on the evidence that measures of semantic similarity between the two terms of a metaphor approximate human judgments of the difficulty of the expression, we used time-locked measures of similarity to reconstruct the evolution of processing costs of literary metaphors over the past two centuries. In this work, we extend this approach previously used on Italian literary metaphors and we present a proof-of-concept study testing its crosslinguistic applicability on a set of 19th-century English literary metaphors. Our results show that the processing costs of metaphors changed as a function of textual genre but not of epoch: cosine similarity between the two terms of literary metaphors is higher in literary compared to nonliterary texts, and this difference is stable across epochs. Furthermore, we show that, depending on the metaphor structure, the difference between genres is affected by word-level variables, such as the frequency of the metaphor’s vehicle and the stability of the meaning of both topic and vehicle. In a broader perspective, general considerations can be drawn about the history of literary and nonliterary English language and the semantic change of words.","Does the metaphor “The wind is a wrestler” convey the same feeling today, as it did in the 1888 when Gerard Manley Hopkins used it in the poem “That nature is a Heraclitean Fire and of the comfort of the Resurrection” AUTHOR? The answer to this question is not trivial: human languages evolve constantly, alongside with the society in which they are used, so much so that the concepts associated with each word, as well as their semantic as- sociations with other words, have changed to different degrees AUTHOR. Studies on lexical semantic change have a long tradition AUTHOR but, with the increasing availability of historical language data and the development of new digital tools, they radically opened up to new approaches coming from computational linguistics and distributional semantics AUTHOR. In the diachronic declination of the Distributional Hypothesis AUTHOR, it is said that changes in the contexts in which a word occurs over time may reveal a change in meaning AUTHOR. Operatively, this means that by training vector space models on historical text corpora from different epochs, it is possible to create time-locked representations of words: if the meaning of a word changed over time, its vectorial representation at t_{1} will be different from its vectorial representation at time t_{2}; conversely, if the two vectors of the same word at t_{1} and t_{2} are in close proximity, the meaning of the word has remained stable. Comparing words vectors diachronically, however, is not effortless and requires the temporal vector space models to be aligned. Alignment is a crucial step in diachronic distributional semantics and it has been tackled by different approaches AUTHOR. Previous studies employing temporal embeddings have found that more frequent words change slower than less frequent words, and that polysemous words change faster than monosemous words AUTHOR, while synonyms tend to change meaning comparably AUTHOR. However, temporal word embeddings have been mostly applied to the study of the semantic change of single words and only marginally to complex linguistic expressions leaving the field with a knowledge gap on the evolution of meaning of a widespread linguistic and textual phenomenon such as, for instance, metaphors. Within the theoretical framework of Relevance Theory AUTHOR, metaphors are non-literal uses of language involving a conceptual adjustment described as context-driven broadening of lexically denoted meaning of words. In terms of linguistic structure, metaphors normally involve two terms, the topic and the vehicle: for example, in the metaphor ‘Sally is a chameleon’, the topic Sally is described by the broadened vehicle chameleon, to indicate a person who changes attitude/behavior to fit their surroundings. While metaphors are broadly used in everyday communication, they are certainly a distinctive feature of literary texts, as long evidenced in stylistics AUTHOR. Past studies on literary metaphors, however, report mixed results. The rating study by Katz et al. AUTHOR found no difference between literary and everyday metaphors, while other studies showed that the former type is less familiar and more open-ended than the latter AUTHOR, but literary metaphors are rated as less difficult and more familiar when presented together with their original context AUTHOR. Moreover, the processing of literay metaphors seems to be particularly effortful, given the multitude of possible meanings they evoke AUTHOR. Therefore, open questions remain regarding how literary metaphors are processed. It must be also underlined that the literary metaphors used in previous studies were written tens or hundreds of years ago. Yet, the effect of this diachronic dimension on their processing costs, as well as its interplay with textual genre in which metaphors are embedded, remains an open question. In addition to its diachronic application, the use of vector space models can help characterize metaphors thanks to the ability of these models to approximate human performance in psycholinguistic tasks. Measures derived from vector space models were shown to be able to approximate how humans process word meaning AUTHOR and, more specifically to correlate with how humans perceive metaphorical expressions in terms of metaphoricity, difficulty, and other psycholinguistic dimensions AUTHOR. In particular, semantic similarity, operationalized in vector space models as cosine similarity (CS) between topic and vehicle, has long been considered relevant for metaphor studies AUTHOR and, more recently, for automatic metaphor identification AUTHOR. In a previous study on Italian AUTHOR, we developed a novel method, employing the Temporal Word Embeddings with a Compass (TWEC) model AUTHOR as training procedure, to capture the temporal dynamics of literary metaphors. This method combines the computational models’ abilities to approximate human judgments and their diachronic applications, allowing to track the diachronic evolution of how literary metaphors are perceived by readers over the course of 200 years. In the present proof-of-concept study, we apply this approach to English, to test its crosslinguistic applicability and whether it can provide language-specific insights into the evolution of metaphors. We take the similarity between the topic and vehicle of a metaphor as a proxy for its difficulty and we analyze how it varies across time and textual genres. We also consider the role of word frequency (WF) and vector coherence (VC), two widely used measures in the study of semantic change AUTHOR, as well as semantic neighborhood density (SND) in shaping the difficulty of the expression. WF and VC were considered to assess the effect of the semantic change of the single word on the evolution of whole metaphor understanding, while SND was considered to analyze the impact of a measure known to synchronically impacts metaphor understanding AUTHOR on its diachronic unfolding.","In this proof-of-concept study, we characterized the temporal dynamics of a set of English literary metaphors to understand whether their processing costs changed over time. We also explored if this change was affected by the genre of the texts, as well as by the semantic properties of the constituting elements of the metaphors (topic and vehicle). By leveraging on the diachronic applications of distributional semantics and extending a method already applied to the study of Italian literary metaphors AUTHOR, we created a series of time-locked semantic representations of 139 English metaphors, from which we derived a measure of the cosine similarity between their terms (CS), taken as a proxy of their difficulty, together with semantic neighborhood density (SND), stability over time (VC), and, from four diachronic corpora, frequency (WF) of their topics and vehicles. Results showed no effect of epoch for either ‘A is B’ or ‘A of B’ literary metaphors. Thus, no noticeable change in CS over time was revealed, suggesting that these metaphors come with similar processing costs for contemporary readers and for readers of the epoch in which the metaphors were created. The absence of an effect of epoch can be better understood by considering the historical evolution of the English language, and specifically its early standardization. As stated by Wyld AUTHOR, literary writing as early as the 18th century was considered `English of our own age in all its essentials’. In line with this consideration, our results point to the stability of the main stylistic features of the English language in the last two centuries, including those related to metaphors. While literary metaphors are not processed differently based on the epoch, the influence of textual genre is noticeable. This factor emerged both as a main effect and in different interaction patterns with single-word variables, varying according to the type of metaphor. For `A of B’ metaphors, results revealed that the difficulty of these metaphors changed as a function of the genre. In particular, they are perceived as less difficult when found in literary contexts, compared to when encountered in nonliterary texts. Hence, the difficulty of these metaphors is sensitive to the style of the text in which metaphors are found: when read in a text that has a literary style and aesthetic intent, the metaphor is less striking than the same metaphor in a nonliterary text. Moreover, we found a strong effect of the stability of the meaning of the vehicle in interaction with epoch and genre. This suggests that `A of B’ metaphors with more unstable vehicles are perceived as less difficult than `A of B’ metaphors with vehicles whose meanings remained stable over time. We interpreted this result in light of Traugott's AUTHOR theory of metaphorization, according to which the metaphorical use of a word can become one of its stable meanings. In the context of the present study, words that changed the most could have done so by incorporating meanings derived from their metaphorical uses. As a result, when these unstable and broadened vehicles are used, metaphors appear less difficult. The reader does not need to broaden the concept expressed by the vehicle to interpret the metaphor, because the metaphorical nuances have entered the standard meaning of the word. From a qualitative observation of the data, we can notice, for instance, that a metaphor such as “Wave of horror”, where the vehicle wave incorporated the meaning of ‘sudden increase in a particular phenomenon’, is perceived as less metaphorical than “Clouds of doubt”, whose vehicle clouds has maintained its original meaning. For ‘A is B’ metaphors, the statistical model highlighted an effect of the frequency of the vehicle in interaction with epoch and genre. In nonliterary texts, the perceived difficulty of `A is B’ metaphors varied as a function of the word frequency (WF) of their vehicle, resulting in opposite patterns in the past and present. In the 19th century, metaphors with less frequent vehicles were perceived as more metaphorical. Conversely, in the 21st century, the less frequent the vehicle, the less metaphorical the metaphor. This 19th-century pattern aligns with prior studies \cite{doi:10.1080/10926488.2018.1434944} showing that metaphors with less frequent vehicles communicate novel information about the topic, thereby enhancing their perceived metaphorical nature. For instance, Hopkins’ metaphor “The wind is a wrestler” featured the vehicle wrestler, a low-frequency word in the 19th century, which conveyed novelty about the topic wind, rendering the metaphor more metaphorical and conceptually challenging. However, this same metaphor is perceived differently today as wrestler has become more frequent, reducing its novelty and metaphoricity for 21st-century readers. Overall, our results suggest that in English, metaphor processing costs are not influenced by the temporal distance between their creation (in the 19th century) and their processing by contemporary readers. Instead, the primary modulator of metaphor processing costs appears to be the textual genre in which they appear. This modulation varies depending on the syntactic structure of metaphors and interacts with single-word measures. Distinct patterns emerged for A of B' and A is B' structures in determining metaphor difficulty. For A of B' metaphors, the main effects of genre and vector coherence, interacting with epoch and genre, were observed. For A is B' metaphors, diachronic variations in processing costs were linked to the interaction of word frequency with epoch and genre. While these differences might reflect genuine syntactic effects on metaphorical predication \cite{bambini2013differentiating, carston2023metaphor, tonini2023relationship}, the imbalance in the size of the two metaphor sets might obscure some effects in the less represented `A is B' structure. Further studies are necessary to explore diachronic changes in processing across structural differences more comprehensively. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study adapted a method using temporal word embeddings from Italian to English to investigate metaphor evolution. This approach demonstrated that English literary metaphor processing costs remain stable over time (unlike Italian) but are dynamically modulated by stylistic features and single-word measures. The method's sensitivity to language-specific characteristics underscores its crosslinguistic applicability.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

Recent research leverages self-supervised learning of unlabeled data or employs multilingual models pre-trained on high resource languages for fine-tuning on the target low-resource language. These are effective approaches when the target language has a shared writing tradition, but when we are confronted with mainly spoken languages, being them endangered minority languages, dialects, or regional varieties, other than labeled data, we lack a shared metric to assess speech recognition performance. We first provide a research background on ASR for low-resource languages and describe the specific linguistic situation of Campidanese Sardinian, we then evaluate five multilingual ASR models using traditional evaluation metrics and an exploratory linguistic analysis. The paper addresses key challenges in developing a tool for researchers to document and analyze the phonetics and phonology of spoken (endangered) languages.","The growing interest in understudied languages has led to categorizing them on the basis of resource availability, defining them as high, low, or zero-resource languages. In the narrowest sense, zero and low-resource languages are those lacking sufficient data to train statistical and machine learning models AUTHOR AUTHOR AUTHOR. However, such a technical definition is not adequate to account for the different linguistic scenarios of world languages. As a matter of fact, in the literature, the term low and zero resource languages is still used inconsistently. Sometimes, it is used to describe standard, widely spoken languages with a shared orthography, that cannot rely on many hours of transcribed or annotated speech, see Afrikaans, Icelandic, and Swahili in AUTHOR. Sometimes, it is used for non-standard, widely spoken languages, lacking a shared orthography (no orthography or multiple proposed orthographies) as for Swiss German dialects AUTHOR or Nasal and Besemah AUTHOR. And sometimes to refer to non-standard, endangered languages lacking a shared orthography, like Bribri, Mi’kmaq and Veps AUTHOR. These scenarios are mainly being addressed with two approaches: The first leverages self-supervised learning, and uses unlabeled data from the target language to learn linguistic structures AUTHOR. Self-supervised learning is an optimal choice in low-resource settings because only requires to gather more audio data. However, it seems costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting AUTHOR AUTHOR. The second approach involves training a single multilingual model on labeled data from highly-resourced languages and then applying the trained model to transcribe unseen target languages. This includes the benefits of a supervised learning setting and proved to be effective AUTHOR. Pre-trained multilingual models can then be fine-tuned on just a smaller dataset of labeled data in the target language. Since fine-tuning is a straightforward, efficient approach, it is the preferred one to address the problem of low-resource languages AUTHOR. However, the success of this approach still depends on the amount of available labeled data in the target language or whether or not it is possible to generate more, e.g., via data augmentation. Several data augmentation approaches for low-resource languages are currently being explored, including self-learning AUTHOR, text-to-speech (TTS) AUTHOR or optimized dataset creation approaches AUTHOR. Bartelds and colleagues AUTHOR propose data augmentation techniques to develop ASR for minority languages, regional languages or dialects. They employ a self-training method on Besemah and Nasal two Austronesian languages spoken in Indonesia. In self-training, a teacher XLS-R model is fine-tuned on manually transcribed data, the teacher model is used to transcribe unlabeled speech and then a student model is fine-tuned on the combined datasets of manually and automatically transcribed data. Since the collected 4 hours of manually transcribed speech for Besemah and Nasal followed different orthography conventions, the transcriptions were first normalized to working orthographies and then used for fine-tuning. In the same framework, they leveraged a pre-existing TTS system available for Gronings, a Low-Saxon language variant spoken in the province of Groningen in the Netherlands, to generate more synthetic training data from textual sources and they achieved great results AUTHOR. While fine-tuning paired with data augmentation techniques works for low-resource, widely-spoken languages, developing a speech recognition system for endangered spoken languages also involves ethical considerations towards the local community. More participatory research is required to understand the native speakers' relationship with the written form of their language, as well as with language technologies. In their position paper AUTHOR Liu and colleagues emphasize the importance of creating language technologies in consultation with speakers, activists, and community language workers. They present a case study on Cayuga, an endangered indigenous language of Canada with approximately 50 native elder speakers and an increasing number of young L2 speakers. After gaining insights from the community, they began collaborating on a morphological parser. This tool aids teachers and young L2 students in language learning while gradually providing morphological annotations and segmentations useful for developing ASR systems for researchers. Blaschke and colleagues AUTHOR surveyed over 327 native speakers of German dialects and regional varieties, finding that respondents prefer tools that process speech over text and favor language technology that handles dialect speech input rather than output. Understanding the needs of the speech community and differentiating them from those of linguistic researchers can guide research more effectively. This paper outlines the first steps towards a speech recognition system for researchers to aid the systematic analysis of the phonetics and phonology of Campidanese, an endangered language spoken in southern Sardinia. To achieve this goal, we first describe the situation of the speech community of the target language, we then select five speech recognition multilingual and ready for inference models and evaluate them on Campidanese Sardinian. When multilingual models were not available for speech recognition task, we chose multilingual models fine-tuned on Italian, which we assume to be a relatively close language both genealogically and structurally. We assess the goodness of the models' inferences, first by computing the traditional evaluation metrics, i.e., average Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER), and then carrying out a qualitative linguistic analysis to have better insights of which model best meets the needs for language documentation and research. This work is part of ``New Perspectives on Diphthong Dynamics (DID)'', a joint project between the University of Bozen and the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, focusing on the study of diphthongs dynamics in two understudied languages, i.e., Campidanese Sardinian and Tyrolean and aims to build a corpus for the linguistic documentation of these two languages.","The preliminary analysis carried out in this paper provided insight into how various speech recognition models transcribe data in a Romance language not encountered in the model training. All evaluated models improve their performance as the audio length increases. Best CER values are achieved on audio of read speech longer than 20 seconds. However, short audios of spontaneous speech with an average length of 5.3 seconds achieved a remarkably low CER, meaning better precision compared to the similarly short (3.5 seconds) read speech chunks. These results suggest that speech style might also play a role. To investigate whether the models are sensitive to speech style, other linguistic, speaker-specific, or technical variables, such as the topic, age, gender of the speaker, or the acoustic quality of the audio data, should be taken into account. For example, both datasets of spontaneous speech are produced by males over 45, and models might be biased toward an adult male speaker profile. For the time being, we attribute it to the poor representativeness of the dataset and will investigate it in future work. A controlled yet diverse dataset facilitated a qualitative linguistic analysis of the predictions. Interestingly, some models seem to follow the phonotactic constraints of the languages they have been trained on, but at the same time they generalize well to unfamiliar languages, providing quite accurate phonetically-like orthographic transcription of Campidanese Sardinian. These initial considerations should be validated with tests on a larger corpus to eliminate data bias and a more systematic linguistic analysis to avoid cherry-picking. We also plan to look in detail at the speech recognition models' architectures in order to make a informed choice at the fine-tuning phase. In conclusion, it seems that state-of-the-art transcription models, especially multilingual ones, produce a phonetically accurate orthographic transcription of Campidanese Sardinian and thus provide a promising basis for fine-tuning. Specifically, Wav2Vec2 large XLSR-53 and STT Multilingual FastConformer Hybrid proved to be the best models according to the evaluation metrics and preliminary linguistic analysis. STT Multilingual FastConformer Hybrid was the best and most efficient in terms of computational resources, which makes it our first choice for further testing and fine-tuning. However, it is worth noticing, speech recognition systems with orthographic output can be costly in terms of human and computational resources, poorly informative for speech researchers and uninteresting to native speakers; whereas recent work on multilingual automatic phonemic recognition seems a viable alternative worth exploring for documenting endangered spoken languages.

In this study, we present a novel stance detection model that labels claim-perspective pairs as either aligned or opposed. The primary innovation of our work lies in our training technique, which leverages social network data from X (formerly Twitter). Our dataset comprises tweets from opinion leaders, political entities and news outlets, along with their followers' interactions through retweets and quotes. By reconstructing politically aligned communities based on retweet interactions, treated as endorsements, we check these communities against common knowledge representations of the political landscape. Our training dataset consists of tweet/quote pairs where the tweet comes from a political entity and the quote either originates from a follower who exclusively retweets that political entity (treated as aligned) or from a user who exclusively retweets a political entity from an opposing ideological community (treated as opposed). This curated subset is used to train an Italian language model based on the RoBERTa architecture, achieving an accuracy of approximately 85%. We then apply our model to label all tweet/quote pairs in the dataset, analyzing its out-of-sample predictions. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of our stance detection model but also highlights the utility of social network structures in training robust NLP models. Our approach offers a scalable and accurate method for understanding political discourse and the alignment of social media statements.","Stance detection is a critical task within the domain of natural language processing (NLP). It involves identifying the position or attitude expressed in a piece of text towards a specific topic, claim, or entity AUTHOR. Traditionally, stances are classified into three primary categories: favor, against, and neutral. This classification enables a detailed description of textual data, facilitating a deeper insight into public opinion and discourse dynamics. In recent years, the proliferation of digital communication platforms such as social media, forums, and online news outlets has resulted in an unprecedented volume of user-generated content. This surge underscores the necessity for automated systems capable of efficiently analyzing and interpreting these vast text corpora. Stance detection addresses this need by providing tools that can systematically assess opinions and reactions embedded within texts, thus offering valuable applications across various fields including social media analysis AUTHOR, search engines AUTHOR, and linguistics AUTHOR. According to the last report of World Economic Forum AUTHOR, the increase in societal polarization features among the top three risks for democratic societies. While a macroscopic increase of polarization has been observed, an understanding of the microscopic pathways though which it develops is still an open field of research. Through stance detection it would be possible to reconstruct these pathways down to the individual text-comment pairs. Stance detection, has been explored across various fields with differing definitions and applications. Du Bois introduces the concept of the stance triangle, where stance-taking involves evaluating objects, positioning subjects, and aligning with others in dialogic interactions, emphasizing the sociocognitive aspects and intersubjectivity in discourse AUTHOR. Sayah and Hashemi focus on academic writing, analyzing stance and engagement features like hedges, self-mention, and appeals to shared knowledge to understand communicative styles and interpersonal strategies AUTHOR. Küçük and Can define stance detection as the classification of an author's position towards a target (favor, against, or neutral), highlighting its importance in sentiment analysis, misinformation detection, and argument mining AUTHOR. These diverse approaches underscore the multifaceted nature of stance detection and its applications in enhancing the understanding of social discourse, academic rhetoric, and online content analysis. For a review of the recent developments of the field we refer to Alturayeif et al. AUTHOR and AlDayel et al. AUTHOR. In this work, we propose a novel approach to training stance detection models by leveraging the interactions within highly polarized communities. Our method utilizes tweet/quote pairs from the Italian political debate to construct a robust training set. We operate under the assumption that users who predominantly retweet a particular political profile are likely in agreement with the statements made by that profile. We restricted our analysis to retweet since this form of communication primarily aligns with the endorsement hypothesis AUTHOR. Namely, being a simple re-posting of a tweet, retweeting is commonly thought to express agreement with the claim of the tweet AUTHOR. Further, though retweets might be used with other purposes such as those described by Marsili AUTHOR, the repeated nature of the interaction we observe in our networks reduces the probability that the activity falls outside of the endorsement behavior. Conversely, while quoting a tweet works similarly to retweeting, the function allows users to add their own comments above the tweet. This makes this form of communication controversial regarding the endorsement hypothesis, as agreement or disagreement with the tweet depends on the stance of the added comment. On the other hand, the information social media users see, consume, and share through their news feed heavily depends on the political leaning of their early connections AUTHOR. In other words, while algorithms are highly influential in determining what people see and shaping their on-platform experiences AUTHOR, there is significant ideological segregation in political news exposure AUTHOR. It is therefore reasonable to expect that users who almost exclusively retweet a political entity (party, leader, or both) use quote tweets to express agreement with statements posted by that entity and disagreement with statements posted by political entities ideologically distant from their preferred one. Additionally, the quote interaction perfectly encapsulates the stance triangle described by Du Bois AUTHOR. In order to correctly assess political opposition we construct a retweet network and use the Louvain community detection algorithm AUTHOR to characterize leaders and, through label propagation, the followers that align with their views. Through these community labels we construct a dataset of claim-perspective couples by annotating tweet-quote pairs from profiles that clearly express political alignment as favor and annotating tweet-quote pairs in which the profiles come from different communities as against. Finally, we use a pretrained BERT model for Italian language and fine-tune it to the classification task. This methodology aims to enhance the accuracy of stance detection models by incorporating real-world patterns of agreement and disagreement observed in polarized online environments. Further, it enables an unsupervised training paradigm that can be scaled to very large datasets. In the following sections, we will outline the data gathering approach used for the dataset. Subsequently, we will describe the community detection methods employed to identify leaders and users within the Italian political discourse. We will then discuss the model architecture and its training process. In the results section, we will evaluate the model's performance and present our findings. Finally, the conclusion will address potential future developments, the implications of our work, and its limitations.","This study introduces a novel stance detection model that significantly advances the understanding of alignment and opposition in social discourse. By leveraging social network data from X (formerly Twitter), we developed a robust training technique that utilizes interactions within politically aligned communities. Our approach involved curating a dataset of tweet/quote pairs, where the quotes are derived from users' interactions with leaders and politicians. This dataset facilitated the training of a BERT model, which achieved a state of the art accuracy of approximately 85%. Our findings underscore the efficacy of using social network structures to train NLP models, demonstrating that retweet interactions can serve as reliable indicators of political alignment. This methodology not only enhances the scalability of stance detection but also offers a nuanced understanding of political discourse on social media platforms. By reconstructing and validating politically aligned communities through expert knowledge, our model provides a robust framework for analyzing the alignment of social media statements. The implications of this work extend beyond stance detection, offering potential applications in monitoring political sentiment, identifying misinformation, and understanding public opinion dynamics. Future research could explore the integration of additional social network features and exploring the capacity of the model to generalize to other domains, interaction types and understanding how stance propagates within networks. Additionally, investigating the role of specific linguistic markers like adverbs across different languages and cultures can reveal universal and language-specific determinants of stance. While our model shows promising results, it also relies heavily on the assumption that retweets are mainly a form of endorsement, and that quotes within one's own political community are all in agreement and that outside of one's political community they are all in disagreement. While the high level of polarization observed in these networks support the validity of these assumptions, it also restricts the applicability of the model to domains where polarization is evident and these assumptions are valid. We extend our deepest gratitude to Vittorio Loreto, the director of the Sony Computer Science Laboratories (CSL) and Professor at La Sapienza University of Rome, for his invaluable support and sponsorship of this research. His guidance was pivotal for the successful completion of our study. We also thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful suggestions, which have greatly contributed to enhancing the quality of this work. \appendix",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

The main peculiarity of the proposed model is the cross attention mechanism. Cross-attention is an evolution of the attention mechanism that allows the model to examine intermodal relationships to better understand information from different modalities, enabling it to simultaneously focus on the relevant parts of the data extracted from each. We tested the model using textit{MULTI-Fake-DetectiVE} data from Evalita 2023. The presented model is particularly effective in both the tasks of classifying fake news and evaluating the intermodal relationship.","Internet has facilitated communication by enabling rapid, immersive information exchanges. However, it is also increasingly used to convey falsehoods, so today, more than ever, the rapid spread of fake news can have severe consequences, from inciting hatred to influencing financial markets or the progress of political elections to endangering world security. For this reason, mitigating the growing spread of fake news on the web has become a significant challenge. Fake news manifests itself on the internet through text, images, video, audio, or, in general, a combination of these modalities, which is a multimodal way. In this article, we took the two, text and image, components of news as it proposed, for instance, in a social network. In this work we proposed an approach to automatically and promptly identify fake news. We use the dataset MULTI-Fake-DetectiVE{https://sites.google.com/unipi.it/multi-fake-detective}} competition, proposed in EVALITA 2023{https://www.evalita.it} AUTHOR}. The competition aims to evaluate the truthfulness of news that combines text and images, an aim expressed through two tasks: the first, which carries out the identification of fake news (Multimodal Fake News Detection); the second, which seeks relationships between the two modalities text and image by observing the presence or absence of correlation or mutual implication (Cross-modal relations in Fake and Real News). Our approach proposes a Transformer-based model that focuses on relating the textual and visual embeddings of the input samples (i.e., the vector representations of the text and images it receives as input). The aim was to find a way to reconcile the two different representation embeddings because they are learned separately from two different corpora, such as text and images, trying to capture their mutual relationships through some interaction between the respective semantic spaces. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a brief overview of related work, and section 3 describes the architecture of the proposed model. Section 4 discusses the dataset supplied by the Evalita tasks, followed by an overview of our experiments in section 5. Sections 6 and 7 present the final results and our conclusions, respectively.","The Internet has facilitated the multimodality of communication by enabling rapid information exchanges that are increasingly immersive but increasingly used to convey falsehoods. In this study, a multimodal model for identifying fake news was proposed which is based on the mechanism of cross attention between the representations of the features learned by the network on the textual component of the news and those learned on the visual component associated with it. Many multimodal models are based on the concatenation of features learned from distinct modalities which, despite having good performance, however, limit the potential of the interaction between the features themselves. From the experiments carried out, the use of cross-attention demonstrated significant improvements in the performance of the model proposed in this work compared to the first two models classified in the MULTI-Fake-DetectiVE competition for both tasks requested by the organizers, despite the dataset available for training is very small in size and unbalanced both with respect to the categories to be predicted and with respect to the source of the news. Despite the intrinsic complexity of the two tasks, the cross-layer of the proposed model manages to express the representations learned from the text and images of a news story in a harmonious, collaborative and synergistic way, balancing their contributions and preventing one from taking over the other. Future developments concern the components of the model which could use a Visual Transformer AUTHOR instead of the ResNet in order to relate textual embeddings and visuals both generated by training a Transformer network.",15,Fact Checking and Fake News Detection

We consider pairs of adjectives that are reported as antonyms in lexicographic resources and extract the nouns that can be modified by both adjectives from a large corpus. We select a set of 8 nouns for each pair that present higher, lower, and comparable frequencies combined with each antonym respectively and then we perform two experiments with a LLM. Firstly, we perform experiments for masked-token prediction of the adjective, to study the correlation between prediction accuracy and the frequency of the noun-antonym pair. Secondly, we perform a polarity-flip experiment with a multilingual LLM, asking to change the adjective into its positive counterpart, and study the cases where the antonym is changed to the morphological antonym's lexical base, under the hypothesis that a flip to the lexical base indicates a narrower set of senses of the antonymic counterpart.","Antonymy is the semantic relationship between terms with opposite meanings. In their canonical form, two antonyms' meanings can be represented as the poles of a semantic continuum where one term has a ``positive"" semantic value, the other a ``negative"" one AUTHOR. Italian, given a word (e.g., the adjective felice `happy'), antonyms can either be realized via prefixation of that word (e.g. infelice `unhappy') or through an independent lexeme (e.g. triste `sad'). In our work, we refer to these types of antonyms as morphological antonym and lexical antonym, respectively. A word in the lexicon may have both a morphological and a lexical antonym, only one of them, or neither. In this paper, we are interested in triplets of adjectives where a positive adjective (e.g. felice) presents two possible antonyms (or ``co-antonyms''), one formed morphologically by prefixation (e.g. infelice), one morphologically independent (e.g. triste). In this paper, we are interested in studying the factors that govern the selection of the morphological antonym vs. the lexical one. These two types of antonyms express ``negative"" semantics with respect to the opposite, ``positive'' term in different ways: implicitly in the case of lexical antonyms; explicitly in the case of morphological antonyms, by adding a prefix with a negative, contradicting value. Because of their different morphological structure, one possible hypothesis on their lexical competition is that the morphological antonym should have a more restricted semantics, representing the negation of the semantics of its adjectival base, while the lexical antonym should have a broader semantic coverage, as it is morphologically independent from its positive counterpart. To the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical study, especially on Italian, that investigates the competition between morphological and lexical antonyms in single languages. Studies on antonyms do identify the two types of antonyms but generally do not address the factors influencing the preference for one type over the other intralinguistically. This study investigates the competition between these two types of antonyms by firstly studying their distribution in corpora (Section 5.1); secondly, testing the ability of a native-Italian language model to predict them in a masked-token prediction task (Section 5.2); and, finally, performing a substitutability task within the same context by switching the polarity of the context sentence with a SOTA multilingual LLM, in order to study when the adjective is switched to the positive un-prefixed adjective or to another, positive but morphologically unrelated one (Section 5.3).","In our study, we aimed to highlight the differences between the two types of antonyms, morphological and lexical, focusing on a computational account of their context of use. While a lexical analysis did not prove decisive, experiments on masked-token prediction and polarity flip, aimed at approximating their semantic coverage, indicate that, unlike often held in current studies, the lexical antonym seems to posses a narrower lexical coverage and scope, supporting the view (such as AUTHOR's and others') that it is indeed the morphological antonym, despite its apparent closer relationship with its lexical base, that possesses the higher degree of semantic generality. This study has an exploratory nature, as previously mentioned, due to the lack of specific research on the subject. For this reason, a limited number of adjectives were selected, exclusively belonging to the core vocabulary. Additionally, the study focused on the Italian language, not only due to the absence of recent in-depth studies on this language but also because of the general decline in linguistic research on Italian. The results obtained contradicted our initial hypothesis. In the future, these results could be confirmed or entirely overturned if a larger data set were considered. furthermore, it would be interesting to investigate whether the results obtained for Italian are also found in languages with morphology different from that of Italian. In a broader framework of expanding the analysis, it would be interesting to focus on additional linguistic factors that determine the choice of a lexical antonym rather than a morphological one, such as semantic networks or word frequency.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

The existing literature however does not present consistent nor concordant results on the effective interest, involvement and expertise of Generation Z members – namely, the newest entrants into the workforce – in green issues. This study presents a corpus-assisted methodology to explore the profile of the upcoming workforce expected to present itself to companies. With CVs as one of the first interfaces between candidate and company in the recruitment process, a purpose-built corpus consisting of Curricula Vitae from recent graduates of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia was collected. Data is investigated through a Corpus-Assisted Discourse Studies (CADS) framework, proposing a novel interaction between structured metadata and textual information. The original contribution of this approach lies in the extraction of information from the narrative structure of CVs which, guiding the evaluation and exploration of metadata, ensures that the knowledge value of the data can be explored in a discursive manner and not reduced to lists of competences and qualifications.","The pursuit of environmentally sustainable growth is now more prominently featured on the global policy agenda than ever before [1], and the efforts to fight climate change and to support transition towards low or net-zero carbon energy systems have manifested over the last decade through the increasing release of international agreements and strategies striving for a more sustainable future [2]. Achieving a successful transition to a more sustainable economy, however, requires not only government intervention policies, but also a new generation workforce [3] that should be composed of individuals able to deal with complex issues and ambiguous situations associated with sustainable development in unpredictable and often rapidly changing circumstances [4]. Consequently, to stay competitive and participate in the collective effort to face global warming and climate change, organisations need to attract, identify, select and attempt to retain individuals interested in and able to develop green and innovative solutions [5]. Even though by 2025 27% of the workforce will be comprised of individuals from Generation Z [6] - namely, those born roughly between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s –, and despite the growing body of research on this topic [7], the existing literature does not present consistent nor concordant results on the effective interest, involvement and expertise of Generation Z in sustainable and environmental issues [8, 9]. Therefore, this study proposes a corpus-assisted methodology to explore the Gen Z members’ profile as the newest entrants into the workforce, particularly considering the need for a large and well-qualified workforce to effectively manage the ecological transition. Given the crucial role played by universities in educating and shaping the next generation of professionals [10], a sample of recent graduate (2022-2023) has been identified as consistent and representative. Moreover, since in the very early stages of the selection process screening applicants’ Curricula Vitae (CVs) is a widely used recruitment practice to shortlist the best candidates [11], CVs constitute the first documented interface between people and companies. Hence, this research is based on a purpose-built corpus [12] consisting of 8,096 Curricula Vitae from students who received a certified title at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia during the 2022/2023 academic year, collected from the AlmaLaurea database. AlmaLaurea is an interuniversity Consortium representing 82 Italian universities, aimed at facilitating graduates’ access to the job market by helping them to connect with companies. In this regard, one of the main services is the database of students’ Curricula Vitae. Data is investigated through a Corpus-Assisted Discourse Studies (CADS) framework - that “set of studies into the form and/or function of language as communicative discourse which incorporate the use of computerised corpora in their analyses” [13] - serving a novel methodological approach impinging on the interaction between CVs structured metadata and textual information.","The current contribution of this paper is mainly methodological and theoretical, since, starting from a gap in the literature, it proposes to collect and analyse a large number of Curricula Vitae with a novel approach impinging on the underlying narrative dimension of these documents, a procedure that requires to triangulate metadata and textual information, and to make use of both linguistic tools and data science techniques. Despite the reliance on standard approaches, the resulting combination offers both linguists and data scientists a novel perspective on CVs, ensuring that the knowledge value of the data can be explored in a discursive manner and not reduced to lists of competences and qualifications. Preliminary examples show the ability of this method to provide the means to build a profile of the generation described by the data. Additionally, the resulting details may provide interesting insights to companies seeking to engage recent graduates in supporting the ecological transition.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

We aim to determine whether different degrees of cross-linguistic similarities significantly affect mBERT's representations and to observe how these representations change across its 12 layers. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, cross-linguistic similarity did not uniformly impact idiom representations across all layers. While early and middle layers showed no significant differences among idiom categories, higher layers (from Layer 8 onwards) revealed more nuanced processing. Specifically, significant differences between the control category and idioms with similar meaning (SM), as well as between idioms with similar lexical items (SL) and those with similar semantics (SM) were observed. Our analysis revealed that early layers provided general representations, while higher layers showed increased differentiation between literal and figurative meanings. This was evidenced by a general decrease in cosine similarities from Layer 5 onwards, with Layer 8 demonstrating the lowest cosine similarities across all categories. Interestingly, a trend suggests that mBERT performs slightly better with more literal hints. The order of cosine similarity for the categorizations was: idioms with a degree of formal similarity, control idioms, idioms with both formal and semantic similarity, and finally idioms with only semantic similarity. These findings indicate that mBERT's processing of idioms evolves significantly across its layers, with cross-linguistic might affect more significantly in higher layers where more abstract semantic processing likely occurs.","Idioms are one of the most studied linguistic concepts that broadly can be defined as multi-word expressions that are often fixed in terms of their syntactic and lexical aspects, while they usually carry meanings that cannot be directly deduced from the meaning of individual words they contain AUTHOR. Given their syntactic and structural fixedness and non-compositional aspects, they were perceived as peripheral, supplementary, or appendixes to language grammars in earlier approaches to idioms \citep[p.\~504]{fillmore1988}. However, with the increasing interest in corpus studies of language, it has been observed that much of human linguistic production is routinized and prefabricated AUTHOR. Multi-word expressions with a high degree of conventionality do not seem to be marginal or limited linguistic constructions, as they play an important role in our everyday life AUTHOR. In addition, they seem to be used in communication across various contexts, from novels to political debates and therapeutic dialogues AUTHOR. Given their characteristics and their conventionalized meanings, they pose many challenges to language speakers, especially non-native language speakers AUTHOR. However, their characteristics also make them a good case study in different experimental linguistics settings. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their widespread application have prompted linguists to investigate the performance of these models across various linguistic concepts, including idioms AUTHOR. In addition, in the case of multi-lingual models, an interesting research area is how these models encode the different languages on which they are trained AUTHOR. In this study, a categorization of English and German idioms based on three cross-linguistic degrees of similarity is proposed. One category includes idioms that have similar formal and semantic aspects in these languages; the second includes idioms with formal similarities but different semantic aspects; and the third category includes idioms with similar semantic aspects but different formal aspects. The goal of our work is to consider how cross-linguistic similarities among idioms affect the representation of idioms in mBERT. More specifically, the questions underlying the following experiment were: \item Does cross-linguistic similarity have a significant impact on the representation of idioms in mBERT? \item Does the degree of cross-linguistic similarity and the representation of the model change across the 12 layers of mBERT? We hypothesized that mBERT's performance would depend on how it utilizes its multilingual training data. Namely, if mBERT draws from a collective pool of all languages, it should perform consistently across all cross-linguistic categories, similar to how it represents idioms from the language it has been given, that is English in this case. However, if it primarily retrieves data from specific languages, we expect to observe significant performance differences among the categories, potentially mirroring some of the patterns seen in cross-linguistic studies with second language speakers. That is, identical cross-linguistic idioms should be represented almost similarly to the control idioms (in this case, English idioms), and idioms with formal and lexical correspondence could both be represented similarly and, in some cases, more differently from the control idioms. Finally, idioms with only corresponding semantics and different formal aspects should be the most differently represented idioms compared to the control group. Furthermore, given the proposed categorizations based on formal and semantic similarities, we anticipated varying performance across mBERT's 12 layers. Particularly, in lower layers, we expect less differentiation among categories, as these layers typically capture more surface-level features. While in higher layers, which represent more of the semantic aspects, we anticipate more varying trends and larger differences among the categories. Mostly because we are primarily focused on the figurative meaning of idioms across different categories.","Our study investigated how cross-linguistic similarities among idioms affect their representation in mBERT, with a focus on English and German idioms categorized based on three degrees of cross-linguistic similarity. This study aims to answer two main research questions concerning whether cross-linguistic similarity has a significant impact on the representation of idioms in mBERT, and how the degree of cross-linguistic similarity and the representation of the model change across the 12 layers of mBERT. Our findings provide insights into these questions and our initial hypotheses. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we found that cross-linguistic similarity does not have a uniformly significant impact on the representations of idioms across all layers of mBERT. The main effects of our translated idioms categorized into cross-linguistic categories (SI: formal and semantic similarity, SL: similar lexicon, SM: Similar Meaning), were not statistically significant when compared to the control category (English idioms) in the early and middle layers of the model. This result may suggest that mBERT might be utilizing knowledge from all languages in its training data as a collective pool, at least in the case of the studied idioms. This aligns with the idea that mBERT learns multilingual representations that go beyond simple vocabulary memorization, as suggested by \citet{pires2019multilingual}. However, the emergence of significant differences in higher layers (particularly from Layer 8 onwards) might indicate that mBERT's processing of idioms becomes more nuanced as information propagates through the network. This finding partially supports our hypothesis that mBERT might show different performances for each cross-linguistic categorization, but suggests that these differences are more significant in the model's deeper layers. Although there are no significant differences among all categories, in Figure fig:cosine-category there is a continuous trend in different layers showing more similarity first for the SL category, then Control, followed by SI, and finally the SM category. This trend indicates that BERT represents almost all categories similarly, and when there are more literal hints, BERT tends to perform better which aligns with the findings of multi-lingual transfer of \citet{pires2019multilingual}. Moreover, for idioms with semantic similarities, the model demonstrates the lowest cosine similarity between the representations of idioms and their figurative meanings, which might suggest that idioms with only semantic correspondence across the studied languages pose a greater challenge for mBERT in capturing the figurative meanings of idioms. Our second research question focused on how the representation of idioms changes across mBERT's 12 layers. In this analysis, distinct patterns were observed. In early layers (1-4) the cosine similarity for CLS embedding derived from mBERT for the idioms and their corresponding figurative meaning was high and relatively uniform across all categories, suggesting a more general representation, we believe high similarity in early layers can be related to similarity in the syntax of samples and the provided figurative entities since these layers capture more formal and syntactic information. Layer 3 demonstrated the highest cosine similarities, while from Layer 5 onwards, a general decrease in cosine similarities was observed, suggesting increased differences between literal and figurative meanings in higher layers. Layer 8 showed the lowest cosine similarities and marked the beginning of significant differences between categories, particularly for semantically similar idioms (SM category). These findings contribute to our hypothesis that we would observe different performances among the layers of mBERT given the formal and semantic similarities of idioms.",22,Distributional Semantics

However, the pretraining of non-English LLMs is still an underexplored area and there is no open-source endeavor that explores what is achievable with open Italian data. To address this issue, we present Minerva, the first family of LLMs trained from scratch on Italian data. The creation of Minerva is an opportunity to explore and investigate the pretraining of LLMs for the Italian language, outlining the challenges that arise when training LLMs with native Italian texts. Minerva demonstrates that an LLM for a specific language brings a number of practical benefits compared to the adaptation of an existing one, including deep control over the composition of the vocabulary and the training data. With this paper, we aim to provide an overview of the design choices, results, and evaluation of our Minerva models, showing promising results on Italian benchmarks and downstream tasks. Most importantly, we share what we learned and the findings obtained during the development of Minerva, as we believe that our experience will be valuable for the academic and industrial communities interested in training non-English LLMs from scratch. The growing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) has accelerated research efforts to adapt these models for various languages. Despite this, pretraining LLMs from scratch for non-English languages remains underexplored. This is the case for Italian, where no truly open-source research has investigated the pretraining process. To address this gap, we introduce Minerva (), the first family of LLMs trained entirely from scratch on native Italian texts. Our work is the first investigation into the challenges and opportunities of pretraining LLMs specifically for the Italian language, offering insights into vocabulary design, data composition, and model development. With Minerva, we demonstrate that building an LLM tailored to a specific language yields numerous practical benefits over adapting existing multilingual models, including greater control over the model's vocabulary and the composition of its training data. We provide an overview of the design choices, pretraining methods, and evaluation metrics used to develop Minerva, which shows promising performance on Italian benchmarks and downstream tasks. Moreover, we share the lessons learned throughout Minerva's development to support the academic and industrial communities in advancing non-English LLM research. We believe that Minerva serves as an important step towards closing the gap in high-quality, open-source LLMs for non-English languages.","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks are approached, achieving remarkable results in existing areas and opening the door to entirely new research directions and applications. As a result, the energy and resources dedicated to the study and creation of LLMs are growing exponentially. However, most LLMs -- both closed- and open-source -- are predominantly designed for English, posing significant challenges and limitations for their use in non-English settings. In practice, generating Italian text using multilingual or language-adapted English models, e.g., from Mistral AUTHOR or Llama AUTHOR, is computationally more expensive and often less effective compared to using a model specifically designed for the Italian language. This inefficiency stems from the vocabulary of an English or multilingual LLM -- i.e., the lexical units, or tokens, that the model can use to compose text -- when it is not optimized for the Italian language, resulting in Italian words being split into an excessive number of tokens. Consequently, this creates longer sequences of tokens, slower generation times, and higher computational costs, especially since many popular attention mechanisms have a quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. Efforts to create language-specific LLMs are increasing, and fall primarily into two main categories: i) adapting existing English-centric LLMs to other languages, and ii) training LLMs from scratch. The advantages of adapting existing English-centric LLMs to other languages are enticing: starting with a proven model can reduce the computational requirements, and adaptation can be achieved with relatively modest amounts of data. There are several language adaptation techniques, which range from fine-tuning the model on data for the target language AUTHOR to modifying the model's architecture AUTHOR, making these techniques flexible for different budgets and objectives. However, these techniques may not fully capture language-specific nuances and can degrade the performance in the original language, indeed an undesirable effect. Alternatively, training LLMs from scratch provides the freedom to make design choices tailored to the linguistic features of the target language—including morphology, lexicon, syntax, and semantics—which are often overlooked in English-centric models AUTHOR. It also allows for incorporating culturally relevant content, reducing biases that might be present in models primarily trained on English data, thus leading to more inclusive and accurate representations of language use. Unfortunately, while there are several efforts on adapting English-centric LLMs to the Italian language, e.g., Llamantino-2 AUTHOR, Llamantino-3 AUTHOR, DanteLLM AUTHOR, and Camoscio AUTHOR, inter alia, there is no truly open-source endeavor exploring what can be achieved by training an LLM from scratch on Italian data. With this work, we follow the latter path and introduce Minerva, the first family of LLMs designed specifically for the Italian language and pretrained on Italian text. We present the design choices for our models, our data processing, and the evaluation results regarding our Minerva LLMs, showing that our models -- with 350M, 1B, 3B, and 7B parameters -- outperform comparable multilingual models and even rival larger models adapted for Italian. We conclude with a discussion on the benefits and challenges of pretraining LLMs from scratch for the Italian language, sharing our experience and findings to provide valuable insights for the academic and industrial communities interested in training non-English LLMs from scratch. Lastly, we describe the technical details of Minerva-7B, our latest model with 7.4 billion parameters, for which we share our initial results.","In this paper, we demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of pretraining Italian language models from scratch, which not only improves the computational efficiency and performance of an LLM for a target language but reduce linguistic biases inherited from English training corpora AUTHOR. The Minerva models () showcase promising results on a variety of Italian benchmarks and downstream tasks, including news summarization and machine translation. Most importantly, we describe, for the first time, the process of creating an Italian pretraining corpus with more than 1T tokens, and we share findings and insights into the pretraining process of Italian LLMs with the academic and industrial communities, paving the way for future research in training non-English language models. We hope that our contributions will represent a stepping stone for future work on language-specific and multilingual large-scale language modeling.

A case in point is the ``Open Ita LLM Leaderboard'' which only supports three benchmarks, despite being one of the most popular evaluation suite for the evaluation of Italian-language LLMs. In this paper, we analyze the current limitations of existing evaluation suites and propose two ways of addressing this gap: i) a new suite of automatically-translated benchmarks, drawn from the most popular English benchmarks; and ii) the adaptation of existing manual datasets so that they can be used to complement the evaluation of Italian LLMs. We discuss the pros and cons of both approaches, releasing our data to foster further research on the evaluation of Italian-language LLMs.","LLMs are becoming more and more prominent in NLP, showing impressive results on an increasing range of standard benchmarks, thanks in particular to their reasoning and in-context-learning capabilities AUTHOR.

Benchmarks are essential for measuring progress in NLP, providing a standardized way to evaluate and compare models, and this is now especially important for Italian given the growing amount of language-specific models that are being developed for the language AUTHOR. High-quality benchmarks must be well-crafted to ensure they accurately reflect the complexities of the language and the specific challenges it presents. As of today, most of the existing Italian benchmarks are translations of English datasets, which may not fully capture the nuances and unique characteristics of the Italian language. Nevertheless, the ability to automatically translate English benchmarks into Italian is valuable and enticing for two main reasons. First, it provides a way to compare almost 1-to-1 the results obtained in English to the ones obtained in Italian, as the translation process is aimed at keeping an alignment from the source to the target text by design. Second, it provides a quick and relatively simple way of producing a benchmark in Italian, assuming that the translation tool is able to produce high-quality outputs. Unfortunately, the current evaluation suites that are based on automatic translations include only a limited number of benchmarks. For instance, the ``Open Ita LLM Leaderboard'', which is one of the most popular evaluation suites for Italian LLMs, relies on just three main benchmark translations, namely, MMLU, HellaSwag, and ARC-Challenge. This biases and hampers the assessment, and may not allow the advanced capabilities of modern LLMs to be fully analyzed, even though recent efforts are starting to address this limitation AUTHOR. Having gold LLM benchmarks natively written in Italian is also important, as their scarcity hinders the accurate evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in the Italian language, limiting our understanding of their true performance and potential areas for improvement. Indeed, the translation of English-centric benchmarks may contain instances that refer to concepts, entities, cultures, traditions, historic events, politics, and economics that are not akin to what one is more likely to find in Italian texts and/or in Italy AUTHOR. However, the creation of completely new datasets that take into account such elements is difficult, complex, and time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge. Falling in between automatic translations of existing datasets from English and the creation of brand-new datasets in Italian, there is the option of adapting existing Italian datasets that were originally created for a different purpose, to measure the capabilities of LLMs in Italian language understanding and generation. This direction has gained traction over the past few months, with efforts that focus on repurposing Italian tests (usually designed for humans) to evaluate LLMs instead AUTHOR. In this paper, we follow both directions and introduce ITA-Bench, a more comprehensive benchmark suite for the evaluation of Italian-language LLMs. First, ITA-Bench proposes a new extended suite of benchmarks created by automatically translating the most popular English benchmarks into Italian.\ Second, ITA-Bench includes existing manually curated datasets, adapted to enhance the evaluation framework for Italian LLMs. These two complementary approaches aim to bridge the evaluation gap and provide a more thorough understanding of the capabilities of Italian-language LLMs. With ITA-Bench, we hope to foster further development and refinement of evaluation techniques for Italian LLMs, ultimately contributing to the broader field of multilingual NLP. ITA-Bench is available at .","In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation suite aimed at advancing the Italian community's ability to assess the competencies of LLMs on Italian data. Our approach follows two main directions. First, we define a novel pipeline called OBenTO, which involves translating state-of-the-art English benchmarks into Italian. Second, we rephrase existing Italian benchmarks to be used for prompting and testing large language models. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of automatically translated benchmarks, highlighting the inherent challenges of such an approach and analyzing the errors made by four LLMs. We hope that our work can provide a solid evaluation framework for evaluating the capabilities of current and future LLMs in Italian.

However, phenomena that characterize spoken language such as fillers (\textless{}eeh\textgreater{} \textless{}ehm\textgreater{}) or segmental prolongations (the\textless{}ee\textgreater{}) are still mostly considered as disrupting objects that should not be included to obtain optimal transcriptions, despite their acknowledged regularity and communicative value. A recent study showed that two types of pre-trained systems with the same Conformer-based encoding architecture but different decoders – a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoder and a Transducer decoder – tend to model some speech features that are functional for the identification of filled pauses and prolongation in speech. This work builds upon these findings by investigating which of the two systems is better at fillers and prolongations detection tasks and by conducting an error analysis to deepen our understanding of how these systems work.","In recent works on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems based on the computing power of Deep Neural Networks (DNN), a great deal of effort is focused on incrementing the systems' performances by employing increasingly complex, hence hardly interpretable, DNN models that require huge amounts of data for the training, like End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (E2E-ASR) models which represent the state-of-the-art. An E2E-ASR model directly converts a sequence of input acoustic feature vectors (or possibly raw audio samples) into a series of graphemes or words that represent the transcription of the audio signal AUTHOR, as represented in figure fig:e2e_asr. In contrast, traditional ASR systems typically train the acoustic, pronunciation, and language models separately, requiring distinct modelling and training for each component. \centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/e2e_asr.png These systems usually aim to obtain speech transcriptions \lq cleaned\rq from phenomena that characterise spoken language such as discourse markers, particles, pauses, or other phenomena commonly referred to as \lq disfluencies\rq. Studies on the interpretability of the dynamics underlying neural models showed that state-of-the-art systems based on End-to-End models (E2E-ASRs) can model linguistic and acoustic features of spoken language, which can be investigated to explain their internal dynamics. Several probing techniques have been designed to inspect and better understand the internal behavior of DNN layers at different depths. With these techniques, investigations on the internals of DeepSpeech2 AUTHOR revealed the influence of diatopic pronunciation variation in various English varieties and provided evidence that intermediate layers contain information crucial for their classification. Later, a study AUTHOR on the layerwise capacity to encode information about acoustic features, phone identity, word identity, and word meaning based on the context of occurrence highlighted that the last layer right before the decoding module retains information about word meaning information, rather than local acoustic features and phone identity information that are captured by the first layers and intermediate layers respectively. Then, other studies have further investigated the capacity of state-of-the-art models to encode phonetic/phonemic information AUTHOR, lexical tone AUTHOR and gender AUTHOR. Finally, AUTHOR investigated the internal dynamics of three pre-trained E2E-ASRs evidencing the emergence of syllable-related features by training an acoustic-syllable boundary detector. Following this line of research, a recent study AUTHOR investigated the ability of two types of pre-trained systems with the same Conformer-based encoding architecture but different decoders – a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoder and a Transducer decoder – to model features that distinguish filled pauses and prolongations in speech and showed that, despite not being originally trained to detect disfluencies, these systems tend to model some speech features that are functional for their identification. Rather than disregarding the ability of E2E-ASRs to model the acoustic information tied to such speech phenomena as a dispensable noise source, it could be exploited to achieve different ends. On the one hand, it could be used to obtain more accurate transcriptions that provide better, or rather more faithful, representations of the speech signal, which would also support linguistic annotation processes. On the other hand, exploring the systems' modelling ability leads to deepening our understanding of their underlying dynamics. In the last 20 years, disfluency detection tasks have been conducted to improve speech recognition performances AUTHOR and different recent approaches to filler detection achieve rather high performances, see AUTHOR. However, these investigations mostly concern filler particles and, to our knowledge, no such system has been tested on Italian data so far. The proposed work aims to build upon these findings by investigating which of the two decoding systems is better at performing a detection task for fillers and prolongations. Moreover, a quantitative and qualitative error analysis is conducted to deepen our understanding of the way these systems work.","In this work, we build upon a previous study that investigated to what extent modern ASR E2Es encode features related to disfluency phenomena, even if they are not directly trained to do so. We showed that pre-trained models with the same audio encoder but with two different state-of-the-art decoding strategies (CTC and Transducer) capture disfluency-related features, especially in the latest encoding layer, and both model features that can be used for the identification and positioning of disfluent speech segments AUTHOR. Although there seems to be a tendency to forget this information with subsequent layers, as the trends for DTW (figure fig:dtw-distance-sequence) and F1-measure (figure fig:weighted_f1) would suggest, the last layers, which are those closest to the objective function represented by the decoding module, seem the most prone to retain characteristics useful to locate and identify disfluency phenomena. Interestingly, despite the differences between the two decoding modules which are respectively non-recurrent (CTC) and recurrent (RNN-T), the performances for the chosen task are comparable. However, the confusion matrices highlight that the CTC-based classifier performs better in the disfluency feature discrimination task, while the Transducer-based classifier more precisely identifies filled pauses, which could be related to the scope (recurrent/non-recurrent) of the objective function. The results align with the literature that shows a strong sensitivity to features concerning words and phone of the layers closest to the encoder AUTHOR, while the layers closest to the input are more sensitive to features related to accent and local acoustic characteristics AUTHOR. It is worth noticing that, in a recent work AUTHOR, sensitivity to syllabic boundaries was found in layers 3-5, with a pattern similar to the one shown in Figure fig:per_layer_metrics but without the peak in the last layers. The reason can be found in the fact that syllables and their boundaries do not have a graphic distinction in the transcriptions, conversely, in the case of disfluencies, there is a form of transcription that identifies them within a language model. The exploratory analysis of the errors highlighted that prolongations are more difficult to detect than filled pauses, which could depend on their being an integral (though lengthened) part of \lq fluent\rq words while filled pauses are mostly realized as independent elements. Also, instances of prolongation are mostly non-recognized or misclassified as filled pauses when characterized by peculiar \lq non-prototypical\rq phonation features, such as creaky phonations, or filler-like features, as in the case of monosyllabic word-final prolongations. Also, previous studies on the segmental quality of prolongations in Italian AUTHOR showed that prolongations, especially when concerning consonantal sounds, can be realised with schwa sounds similar to those that characterize most filled pauses. This filler-like quality could also be considered among the underlying reasons for the negative correlation between the evaluation metrics of prolongations misclassification and their duration. Another possible motivation could reside in a bias in the dataset combined with the classifier architecture (LSTM), which easily recognises prolongations responding to a specific length pattern. This means that the scarcity of longer prolongations hinders their modelling leading to their misclassification. These findings could be used to improve transcription applications by enriching them with disfluency annotation (including filler particles and prolongation phenomena), which are still rather costly processes for studies concerning hesitation phenomena and (own) speech management in typical as well as atypical speech (e.g., pathological or language learners' speech. Indeed, an immediate development of the described work consists of increasing the capabilities of the pre-trained E2E-ASRs by adding a simple disfluency identification module to complement the existing decoder, thus enriching the resulting transcriptions. Our work is built upon unidirectional LSTMs rather than on bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs), which provide better performance because the latter have slightly longer inference times and require a larger amount of data, resources, time to be trained and, most importantly, present a more complex behaviour AUTHOR. However, the introduction of different architecture modules like bidirectional LSTM could improve the detection of prolongation disfluencies. This will be part of future developments focused on performance and increased neural network complexity.",13,Multimodal

This work proposes an empirical method based on the quartiles of the polarity distribution for a lexicon-based SA approach. Our experiments are based on the Italian linguistic resource MAL (Morphologically-inflected Affective Lexicon) and applied to two annotated corpora. The findings provided a better detection of the neutral expressions with preserving a substantial overall polarity prediction.,"Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a well-studied task of Natural Language Processing (NLP), whose main objective is to classify opinions from natural language expressions as positive, neutral, negative or a mixture of those [1]. The neutrality detection in SA is an issue approached in different ways [2, 3, 4], but low agreement on how detecting neutral expressions still exists [4, p.136]. In this paper, we approach neutrality detection in lexicon-based SA, where an affective lexicon provides polarity scores ranging from −𝑎 to +𝑎 with 𝑎 ∈ 𝑁, by using a descriptive statistical method based on the quartiles. To our knowledge, this issue was not investigated so far. We aim at drawing attention towards a better prediction of the neutral expressions. This is done by automatically finding out an optimal interval of neutral scores with a control for the asymmetry of the distribution of the scores across the polarity spectrum. Traditionally, neutrality scores have been assumed to be around point 0, or within a conventionally fixed and algebraically-led interval of [−.5;+.5]. Conversely, it seems more reasonable to postulate that this neutral cluster should lie in a dynamic interval around the zero value. As expected, the [−.5;+.5] interval is indeed insufficient for capturing the neutral values, especially when the polarity scores are symmetrical around the point zero. This is because small positive or negative deviations from zero can be incorrectly classified into their respective polarity if they are neutral. Furthermore, for topics with many controversial opinions, where polarities are indeed dispersed, the misclassification of neutral expressions appears significant, as small positive and negative deviations from zero might be more frequent. As a consequence, the neutral interval also appears to be topic-oriented and thus differs from any SA task, as the topic could, in turn, also influence the symmetry of the distribution of scores. The linguistic counterpart to this phenomenon is that “opinions may be so different that common ground may not be found” [5]. On the other hand, especially in the case of unimodal distributions, the more asymmetrical the polarity scores distribution is, the more the polarities might be positively or negatively skewed, and the less likely a false neutral classification should occur. In the case of multimodal distributions, with multiple possible polarizations, detecting the asymmetry becomes more complex as well as the neutral expressions. But, despite the peculiar situation with the same frequencies for oppositely polarized scores, the more a multimodal distribution is skewed (many different modes/peaks possibly far from zero) the less likely false neutral classifications should again occur.","The asymmetry of a polarity scores distribution seems to be topic-oriented and therefore the neutrality detection for a lexicon-based SA with polarity scores reasonably passes through an optimal interval within the first and the third quartile [𝑄1,𝑄3] that takes this asymmetry into account. The findings of this work stipulated that the quartile-based approach is suitable for any corpus where a task of lexicon-based SA with scores is performed. Hence, we do strongly recommend further experiments on other corpora, both annotated and unannotated, and comparing/integrating this method with others (e.g. Valdivia et al. [4]) for the common objective of detecting neutral expressions. Eventually, it is worthwhile noticing that our methodological framework led us to run experiments on test sets of different sizes in order to consider all potential and reasonable unseen data situations. Alternatively, one could propose a similar experiment with fixed-size test sets, which would have provided more stable, comparable results even with established benchmarks, but on the other hand would also significantly reduce the amount of test data.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

In this paper, we explore Back-Translation (BT) as a data augmentation method to enhance such datasets by artificially introducing semantics-preserving variations. We investigate French and Italian as source languages on two multilingual datasets annotated for the presence of stereotypes or irony and evaluate French/Italian, English, and Arabic as pivot languages for the BT process. We also investigate cross-translation, i.e., augmenting one language subset of a multilingual dataset with translated instances from the other languages. We conduct an intrinsic evaluation of the quality of back-translated instances, identifying linguistic or translation model-specific errors that may occur with BT. We also perform an extrinsic evaluation of different data augmentation configurations to train a multilingual Transformer-based classifier for stereotype or irony detection on mono-lingual data. Warning: This paper may contain potentially offensive example messages.","Equipping systems with linguistics-grounded capabilities can be complex. Despite the advancements by Large Language Models (LLMs), the availability of annotated corpora remains crucial. State-of-the-art systems still exhibit shortcomings, for example, when access to context or pragmatics for giving a true comprehension of the features of the involved phenomena is required [1]. Unfortunately, the development of large datasets annotated for specifically complex phenomena can be very time-consuming. When only small corpora are available, data augmentation techniques can be applied [2, 3]. Given a small set of original sample data, data augmentation artificially generates new instances that are similar and comparable to the existing data and can, therefore, be used to train and test systems with an extended dataset. In this paper, we present experiments for augmenting two small datasets annotated for two diverse, challenging phenomena, namely stereotypes and irony detection. In several works exploring data augmentation, Back-Translation (BT) [4] was shown to be a strong and relatively easy-to-implement baseline [5, 6]. A BT process generally consists of two steps: given one or multiple translation systems, a text in a source language is first translated into a chosen pivot language, and the resulting text is then translated back into the source language. The expected output of the BT process is a text that is similar but not the same as the original input, accounting for the linguistic differences intrinsic to the language pair, but also the idiosyncrasies of the chosen translation model(s). This relies on the fact that translation is only partially deterministic: the expected output should have the same meaning as the input, outputs that morphologically or syntactically differ may be considered as correct translations of the input. In BT, the application of (at least) two translations improves the variability between the input and the output text. The usefulness of a dataset augmented by applying BT depends on the quality of the translated outputs. Outputs too similar to the inputs can cause overfitting when used for training, while with too different outputs, there is a risk of a shift in distribution that is too large, which may negatively impact performance, at least in intradataset evaluations. A compromise between these two alternatives must be found. Therefore, an evaluation of the quality of translations and back-translations is important to assess the benefits. In this paper, we want to investigate the viability of BT as a data augmentation technique for low-resource tasks in various configurations. We use French and Italian as source languages — leveraging two multilingual datasets with subsets for these languages — and various languages as pivots for the BT process (French/Italian, English, and Arabic). We compare BT with an alternative process for data augmentation, specific for multilingual datasets, which we refer to as “cross-translation,” where the data from one language subset is translated and then used as a data augmentation source for another language subset. Our contributions are (1) an intrinsic qualitative human evaluation of translations and back-translations for stereotypes detection and irony detection datasets in various combinations of source and pivot languages, followed by (2) an extrinsic evaluation of machine learning model performance on these datasets, using these various data augmentation sources.","In this work, we have investigated using Back-Translation as a data augmentation technique for challenging low-resource tasks like stereotypes and irony detection, in a multilingual context. Through an intrinsic evaluation of the quality of the augmented instances, we identified modes of failure of Machine Translation, which could negatively impact the data augmentation process. These errors stem from the intrinsic differences between typologies and specific languages or translation model idiosyncrasies themselves potentially learned from methods like BT. Through a preliminary extrinsic evaluation of two multilingual datasets, we found that cross-translation can outperform Back-Translation, allowing us to augment one language subset by leveraging the variety of inputs present in the others. In future work, we aim to expand this study to more numerous and varied source and pivot languages, and different data augmentation configurations, namely, different proportions and selections of injected augmented data. We may also compare Back and Cross-Translation against or alongside other related techniques, such as multitasking learning or Active Learning. We also expect that some improvements can be obtained by mitigating translation failures; this can be done, for example, by leveraging an external LLM to check each step and remove or correct the errors from the final augmented dataset. Finally, it could also be interesting to perform tests with different model types on top of RoBERTa.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

However, it is still an open question how to use those models for task-oriented dialogs such as booking or customer information systems, and such. In this work, we propose Dynamic Prompting, an architecture for task-oriented dialog, integrating the benefits of Large Language Models and showcasing the approach on the MultiWOZ 2.2 dataset. Our architecture leads to a high task success rate, provides sensible and specific answers, and is resistant to hallucinations. Further, we show that Dynamic Prompting is able to answer questions that were not anticipated by the dialog system's designer and that it can correct several types of errors and other characteristics of the system.","Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODS) assist users in completing a task within a conversation [1], for instance, in the context of customer information and bookings (train/restaurant). In an applied setting with real users, it is important that those systems provide correct answers, tasks can be quickly solved, and lead ideally to high user satisfaction. To ensure this, TODS often provide a high level of control over its dialog management and answer behavior for system developers. Existing solutions normally either manually implement a dialog manager to control the complete interaction, or train it on large amounts of dialog interactions [2, 3, 4, 5]. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) are very good at open-domain dialog and provide fluent and convincing messages in different styles. However, those answers might be misleading and even false (hallucination) [6, 7, 8]. In task-oriented dialog, the model could possibly ‘break out’ of the given dialog task. Using LLMs for task-oriented dialog is still in its infancy. Madotto et al. [9] used LLMs for the whole pipeline of Natural Language Understanding, Dialog State Tracking, Dialog Policy and Natural Language Generation. Hudeček and Dusek [10] expand on this idea by evaluating the abilities of LLMs to generate complete task-oriented multi-turn dialogs. They used LLMs for NLU and DST also but, unlike our work, they used a static prompt. Other approaches to LLMs for task-oriented dialog are presented by Cao [11], Hu et al. [12], Wei et al. [13], Li et al. [14]. To address those limitations and concerns, we propose Dynamic Prompting, a technique to combine a traditional task-oriented dialog system pipeline with the benefits of LLMs. Showcased and tested in the context of restaurant booking, we present the advantages and limitations of our approach.","We presented Dynamic Prompting, a technique integrating LLMs for task-oriented dialog. The results show high sensibility and specificity values, which indicate that the system answers on point and does not deviate from the dialog’s goal. The relatively low Prompt Extraction Performance and Response Slot Accuracy values still result in excellent task success. The high values in the performance metrics Prompt Instruction Performance and Information Extraction Performance indicate that the LLM follows the task-oriented guidance of the dynamic prompts. The Information Extraction Performance of 0.98 shows that the system could very well reuse the database information embedded in the prompt in the JSON format. In addition, our system shows various ways to correct errors, such as NLU errors, user requests not anticipated by the designer of DS, and errors in the format of the database entries. Moreover, the generated system answers are more diverse (Section 3.1.4) and more polite (Section 3.1.2) than the human-generated responses in the dataset. We would like to examine these qualitative results in future research in a more quantitative way. Overall, we find that the widespread problem of hallucinations in LLMs is not an issue in our system as long as we present the correct information to the LLM. As soon as the user asks the system for information that is not present in the prompt, such as the booking reference numbers, the LLM starts to hallucinate. Although we assess the system’s performance solely on the restaurant domain, the dynamic prompting method can be extended to other domains in the MultiWOZ 2.2 dataset, such as hotel, taxi, and train. Expanding to new domains will require updating the prompt generation module to accommodate new intents and state values, ensuring smooth integration with these additional domains.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

This paper explores advancements in Italian Sign Language (LIS) recognition using a multimodal dataset in the medical domain: the MultiMedaLIS Dataset. We investigate the integration of RGB frames, depth data, optical flow, and skeletal information to develop and evaluate two computational models: Skeleton-Based Graph Convolutional Network (SL-GCN) and Spatiotemporal Separable Convolutional Network (SSTCN). RADAR data was collected but not included in the testing phase. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of these models in enhancing the accuracy and robustness of isolated LIS signs recognition. Our findings highlight the potential of multisource approaches in computational linguistics to improve linguistic accessibility and inclusivity for members of the signing community.","Italian Sign Language (LIS- Lingua dei Segni Italiana) is the primary means of communication within the Italian signing community. Due to their visual-gestural modality, sign languages (SLs) were initially not considered fully-fledged linguistic systems. However, since the 1960s, beginning with Stokoe’s pioneering works [1], the contemporary study of SLs has evolved into a robust field of research. Over the past half-century, significant societal and scientific advancements have transformed the perception and status of SLs, now recognized as natural and complete languages, having received legal recognition in many countries. In the Italian context, the study of signed communication began in the early 1980s, involving both hearing and deaf researchers. At that time, what we now call LIS was still mostly unnamed and was often referred to as ‘mime’ or ‘gesture’ by both signers and non-signers alike [2]. The first significant publications on LIS [3] [4], along with the collaborative efforts of deaf and hearing researchers, initiated a transformative period in SL research in the Italian context [5]. This shift in perspective was influenced by factors beyond the language itself, such as increased meta-linguistic awareness and greater visibility of the community and its language to the wider public. In fact, from a societal perspective, the visibility of SL in Italy, especially in media, has significantly changed with technological advancements, mirroring global trends. In the late 1980s, Italy introduced subtitles in movies on television, marking a step toward content accessibility. The importance of media accessibility, through subtitles or LIS interpreting, was accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The need for equitable access to critical information for deaf individuals became evident, with efforts born within the community stressing the central role of LIS in ensuring that the deaf signers received accessible information during challenging times [6], highlighting the significant communication barriers that deaf individuals face, especially when in-person interactions were restricted. This increased visibility, along with persistent advocacy by the signing community, played a crucial role in the official recognition of LIS and Tactile LIS (LISt) in May 2021. Within this evolving societal and linguistic framework, the increased media visibility of LIS and the introduction of video capturing tools in daily lives, language collection emerges as a central issue. For SLs, the need for comprehensive collections is particularly significant. Unlike oral languages, which in some cases have developed standardized written systems, SLs must rely on video collections to capture signed communication accurately. These videos, whether raw or annotated, are essential for analyzing SLs with both qualitative and quantitative evidence.","In this study, our goal was to demonstrate our first steps into testing the efficacy of the MultiMedaLIS Dataset in contributing to the advancement of the field of SLR through multisource approaches. The integration of RGB frames, depth data, optical flow, and skeletal data has provided a comprehensive basis for developing and evaluating SLR models. Our experiments with the SL-GCN and SSTCN architectures have highlighted advancements in recognizing isolated LIS signs in medical semantic contexts, given the domain of our Dataset. The SL-GCN model, trained on skeletal data to construct temporal graphs, achieved accuracy in capturing spatiotemporal relationships critical to sign recognition. This approach not only enhances the precision of rendering LIS signs but is also reinforced by a Dataset able to support robust graph-based convolutional networks in multimodal SLR tasks. At the same time, our Dataset proved robust, precise and variable enough for SSTCN model testing, focusing on spatiotemporal separable convolutions, revealing robust performance in extracting spatial dynamics from RGB frames. Having validated the visual modalities on the mentioned models, we have promising preliminary results on adapting these models to accept RADAR data. We plan to extract the pre-trained RADAR data processing module and use it independently during inference. This approach will eliminate the need for RGB visual data. Furthermore, we plan to expand the Dataset by applying the same protocol with 10 deaf signers. This will effectively increase the current Dataset, enhancing the generalizability across different signers. Our goal is to develop an autonomous, resource-constrained system (thanks to the exclusion of RGB data) that operates on-edge or even offline. This cost-effective solution can be used in any emergency contexts where direct access to interpreting is not available.",13,Multimodal

It is defined as the task of replacing complex words with simpler synonyms that are more accessible to speakers, while preserving the original text’s meaning [2]. A complex word is one that is difficult for some readers to decode due to various characteristics that hinder comprehension [3, 4]. This area of research is of significant interest both socially and in computational applications. Socially, automatic simplification can enhance text comprehension for individuals with reading difficulties [5, 6], second language learners [7], those with cognitive disabilities [8], or individuals with lower literacy levels [9]. In general, making texts accessible to everyone is a democratic act, as it ensures that information and knowledge are available to all members of society, regardless of their reading ability or educational background [10]. From a computational perspective, it proves valuable for complex tasks such as machine translation [11], information retrieval [12], and summarisation [13] in addition to being an integral part of generic text simplification [1]. The ability to simplify text effectively can improve the performance of these applications by making the input data more uniform and easier to process [2]. Lexical simplification encompasses various subtasks [14]. The two most important ones are: 1. the prediction of word complexity, which involves identifying the words that need to be simplified [15]; 2. the replacement of complex words with simple synonyms [16]. Lexical complexity prediction (1) normally involves assigning a complexity value to a lexical item in context, ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 represents maximum simplicity and 1 denotes complexity [4]. This approach is a more advanced evolution of the traditional binary Complex Word Identification (CWI) [3], which classified words simply as complex or not complex. By moving towards a gradualism approach, lexical complexity prediction provides a finer-grained, continuous assessment of word difficulty, allowing for more tailored simplification efforts. The replacement of complex words with simpler synonyms (2) comprises three subtasks: the generation of substitutes, the ranking based on complexity, and the selection of the most appropriate substitute [14]. This multi-step process ensures that the chosen synonym not only reduces complexity but also fits seamlessly into the original context. One of the major challenges for such a user-dependent and therefore complex task is the lack of extensive annotated linguistic resources needed to train and evaluate automatic simplification models [2, 4]. Annotated datasets are crucial for developing and testing algorithms that can perform these tasks accurately. In this context, we present MultiLS-IT, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset specifically designed for automatic lexical simplification in the Italian language. This resource is part of a larger multilingual dataset, Multi-LS (Multilingual Lexical Simplification) [17], created for a shared task at the BEA workshop [18]1. The main contributions of this work are: • A detailed description of the data collection and annotation process of the Italian sub-dataset; • A descriptive analysis including statistics and visualizations providing an overview of the dataset’s characteristics; • The establishment of a reference point for future research in lexical simplification for Italian. With this work, we aim to fill a significant gap in lexical simplification research for Italian and provide a solid foundation for future studies and more effective lexical simplification technologies.","In this study, we present MultiLS-IT, the first dataset specifically designed for automatic lexical simplification in Italian. As part of the larger Multi-LS dataset, it addresses a significant gap in resources for lexical simplification in Italian. Despite its limited size, we believe that MultiLS-IT offers a valuable starting point for the development and evaluation of automatic simplification models. Our detailed description of the data collection and annotation process, including complexity ratings and synonym suggestions, provides a protocol that we hope will be followed and extended to increase the resources available for the Italian language. Our analysis revealed that the average complexity score of all target words is 0.276, with a standard deviation of 0.168, highlighting the range of complexity levels within the dataset. Including more diverse and complex contexts would provide a richer resource for training and evaluating simplification models. The inter-annotator agreement value of 0.4230 reflects a moderate level of consistency among annotators, emphasizing the inherent subjectivity in assessing lexical complexity. This relatively low value highlights the need to increase the sample size of both the dataset and the number of annotators to obtain more robust results. Future work should focus on expanding the dataset to include a greater variety of texts and more annotators to improve the reliability and generalizability of the results. Our goal is to create broader resources that enable the development of robust and effective lexical simplification technologies that can improve text accessibility and comprehension for a wide range of readers. In conclusion, while MultiLS-IT represents a significant step forward in the field of lexical simplification for Italian, there is still considerable potential for growth. Expanding the dataset to include a broader range of texts, increasing the number of annotators, and refining the annotation guidelines are all crucial steps toward improving the dataset’s quality. Additionally, the application of more advanced computational models and the exploration of real-world use cases will further contribute to the development of sophisticated tools for lexical simplification. We hope that this dataset will serve as a foundation for future research and development in automatic simplification, ultimately making information more accessible and comprehensible to all.",11,Text Simplification
690_2024,2024,120_Paper,Laura Occhipinti,Enhancing Lexical Complexity Prediction in Italian through Automatic Morphological Segmentation,ENG,1,1,1,Università di Bologna,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,Bologna,"Morphological analysis is essential for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, as it reveals the internal structure of words and deepens our understanding of their morphological and syntactic relationships. This study focuses on surface morphological segmentation for the Italian language, addressing the limited representation of detailed morphological information in existing corpora. Using an automatic segmentation tool, we extract quantitative morphological parameters to investigate their impact on the perception of word complexity by native Italian speakers. Through correlation analysis, we demonstrate that morphological features, such as the number of morphemes and lexical morpheme frequency, significantly influence how complex words are perceived. These insights contribute to improving automatic lexical complexity prediction models and offer a deeper understanding of the role of morphology in word comprehension.","Morphological analysis is crucial for various NLP tasks, as it provides insights into the internal structures of words and helps us better understand the morphological and syntactic relationships between words [1]. The Italian language, with its rich morphology and extensive use of inflection and derivation, presents unique challenges and opportunities for morphological segmentation. Automatic segmentation, a key component of morphology learning, involves dividing word forms into meaningful units such as roots, prefixes, and suffixes [2]. This task falls under the broader category of subword segmentation [3] but is distinct due to its linguistic motivation. Computational approaches typically identify subwords based on purely statistical considerations, which often results in subunits that do not correspond to recognizable linguistic units [4, 5, 6, 7]. Making this task more morphologically oriented could enable models to generalize better to new words or forms, as basic roots or morphemes are often shared among words, and it could also facilitate the interpretation of model results. When discussing morphological segmentation, we can refer to two types: (1) Surface segmentation, which involves dividing words into morphs, the surface forms of morphemes; (2) Canonical segmentation, which involves dividing words into morphemes and reducing them to their standard forms [8]. For instance, consider the Italian word mangiavano (they were eating). The resulting surface segmentation would be mangi- + -avano, where mangi- is a morph derived from the root of the verb mangiare, and -avano is the suffix indicating the third person plural of the imperfect tense. In contrast, the canonical segmentation would yield mangiare + -avano, with mangiare as the canonical morpheme and -avano as the suffix. In this study, we focus on surface morphological segmentation for the Italian language. Morphological features are often not adequately represented in available corpora for this language, or they refer exclusively to morphosyntactic information, such as the grammatical category of words and a macro-level descriptive analysis mainly related to inflection. Information about the internal structure of words, such as derivation or composition, is often lacking. The primary objective of this work is to use an automatic segmenter to extract a series of quantitative morphological parameters. We believe that our approach does not require the detailed analysis provided by canonical segmentation, which could entail longer processing times. In addition to examining classic parameters reported in the literature that influence complexity [9], such as word frequency, length, and number of syllables, we aim to explore how morphological features integrate with these factors to affect word complexity perception. Specifically, we seek to understand how the internal structure of words contributes to the cognitive load that speakers experience when processing more complex lexical items. Our premise is that words with more morphemes are more complex because they contain more information to decode [10]. For example, consider the word infelicità (unhappiness). To decode it, one must know the word felice (happy), from which it is derived, as well as the prefix in-, which negates the quality expressed by the base term, and the suffix -ità, which transforms the adjective into an abstract noun. Therefore, to fully understand the meaning of infelicità, the reader or listener must be able to correctly recognize and interpret each of these morphemes and their contribution to the overall meaning of the word. The main contributions of this work are: (1) Providing a tool capable of automatically segmenting words into linguistically motivated base forms; (2) presenting the dataset constructed for training our model; (3) evaluating the impact of different linguistic features on speakers’ perception of word complexity, with a particular focus on morphological features.","This study highlights the significance of integrating morphological features into automatic models to enhance the comprehension and prediction of lexical complexity. The high performance of the Neural Morpheme Segmentation model demonstrates the efficacy of convolutional neural networks in capturing the detailed patterns of morphological segmentation in the Italian language. The correlation analysis reveals that while traditional metrics like word length and frequency are valuable predictors of complexity, incorporating morphological features provides additional insights that enrich our understanding of lexical complexity. Notably, the positive correlation between the number of morphemes and perceived complexity suggests that words with more morphemes are inherently more complex. Conversely, frequent lexical morphemes tend to reduce perceived complexity, highlighting the importance of familiarity in complexity perception. Our study also emphasizes the need for diverse linguistic features, including both surface characteristics and morphological traits, to create more robust and accurate models for predicting word complexity. The statistically significant correlations for most features validate their relevance in complexity prediction. However, it is important to note that our findings are based on a relatively small dataset of annotated complexity perceptions. To obtain more robust and generalizable results, it would be highly beneficial to have access to a larger and more diverse dataset of complexity annotations. Expanding the dataset to include a wider variety of texts and contexts would enhance the reliability of the correlations observed and improve the training and evaluation of automatic complexity prediction models. Future research should focus on gathering more extensive annotated datasets and exploring additional linguistic features that may influence complexity perception. By doing so, we can further refine our models and develop more effective tools for lexical simplification and other applications aimed at improving text accessibility.",7,Lexical and Semantic Resources and Analysis

In this context, we propose a new dataset of activists’ and users’ comments on Facebook reacting to specific news headlines: AmnestyCounterHS. Taking into account the literature on counterspeech, we defined a newschema of annotation and applied it to our dataset, in order to examine the most used counter-narrative strategies in Italy. This research aims to support the future development of automatic counterspeech generation. This paper presents also a comparative analysis of our dataset with other two datasets in Italian (Counter-TWIT and multilingual CONAN) containing dangerous speech and counter narratives. Through this analysis, we will understand how the environment (artificial vs. ecological) and the topics of discussions online influence the nature of counter narratives. Our findings highlight the predominance of negative sentiment and emotions, the varying presence of stereotypes, and the strategic differences in counter narratives across datasets.","Recently, the attention about dangerous speech (DS) online has increased in different sectors, ranging from initiatives for monitoring the DS’ spread, particularly in Italy (e.g., by VOX1, or by researchers like Capozzi et al. [1]), to prevent the escalation of DS online using methods of detection and removal of dangerous contents (e.g., following the policies of social platforms). Moreover, specific actions of countering DS online, like the Amnesty Task Force on Hate Speech2, which reassembles specialized activists who actively intervene by writing counterspeech, were promoted3 in response to potential or effective dangerous speech or news on various topics. In this context, the new techniques of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) can play a very important role. On DS detection, the literature is vast [4, 5] and covers various nuances of DS [6, 7], different types of manifestation (i.e., explicit and implicit, [8]), and co-occurrences with other psychological and linguistic phenomena, like stereotypes [9] and sarcasm [10]. Regarding works on countering DS, some studies focused on imitating the operators of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in their intervention in online discussions, or selecting the most suitable responses from a database [11], or creating generative models able to reply automatically to hateful content using counter narratives (CN), avoiding hallucinations [12]. The development of NLU and NLG models are mainly based on data-driven approaches, which imply the creation of a specific dataset to detect DS or generate adequate CN. According to the survey by Bonaldi et al. [2], in literature, the available datasets in languages other than English are very few. Among them, currently, only two datasets contain Italian texts: CONAN [13] and Counter-TWIT [14]. The creation environment of CONAN is artificial (i.e., activists have been asked to write CN to specific hateful comments), and the one of Counter-TWIT is entirely ecological (i.e., collection of tweets written by users). In this scenario, in our work, we propose a new dataset, AmnestyCounterHS, which, differently from the existing ones, reflects the real action of activists online. Indeed, our dataset, compiled from Facebook, includes interactions guided by the Amnesty Task Force on Hate Speech (HS), representing an ecological and spontaneous context. Here, the intervention of counterspeech is guided by Amnesty International activists who decided to intervene under certain posts potentially dangerous spread by online newspapers or users (e.g., verbal attacks to women, immigrants, and so on). Moreover, inspired by existing strategy taxonomies [15, 13, 14], we mapped a more complete taxonomy inclusive of both existing and new strategies found in our dataset. This new resource allows us to analyze the used strategies of CN in the Italian language across different types of messages and contexts (CONAN, Counter-TWIT, AmnestyCounterHS). By comparing these datasets, we propose to examine: 1) which strategy of CN is the most used in the different contexts and discussions online; 2) what the differences are in terms of sentiments, emotions, and the presence of stereotypes, between potentially dangerous messages posted online and the counterspeech produced by activists/users in all the datasets. The importance of understanding how these strategies of CN are used relies on the need to raise social awareness about real events, the necessity to be correctly informed about facts (avoiding fake news), as well as to be conscious of the consequences of dangerous speech in the target groups [16].","In this paper, we examine the strategy of CN used in various contexts, looking at their characteristics and typology across different datasets in Italian: CONAN, Counter-TWIT, and AmnestyCounterHS. Thanks to this comparative analysis, we noticed that different environments and topics affect the type of strategy used by activists or users who want to counter DS [18]. One of the main points that we want to underline is the importance of the conversational context [19, 20, 21, 22]. In our dataset, AmnestyCounterHS, the annotators showed difficulties in understanding the position of the author of the message, without the entire conversational thread. For instance, let us consider this comment written under some news about COVID-19: ""Infatti. Ampiamente dimostrato""26. Without the full conversation, it is challenging to determine whether this comment is supporting or contradicting an argument about COVID-19. Similarly, let us take a look at the comment: ""Grande argomentazione, scuola di Demostene? #posailfiasco""27 written under this newstitle: ""Un milione di profughi sono ostaggio di Erdogan""28. We can clearly see that the comment is ironic, but we cannot understand its stance on integration. For this reason, future developments in automatic counterspeech generation should focus on incorporating comprehensive conversational threads to enhance accuracy and relevance. This approach will be fundamental to create effective AI-driven counter-narrative systems.",6,"Sentiment, Emotion, Irony, Hate"

Assessing LLM Trustability in Task-oriented Dialogues,ENG,4,1,0,"Libera Università di Bolzano, Fondazione Bruno Kessler",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,Italy,"Bolzano, Trento","Despite the impressive capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like text, their ability to produce contextually appropriate content for specific communicative situations is still a matter of debate. This issue is particularly crucial when LLMs are employed as assistants to help solve tasks or achieve goals within a given conversational domain. In such scenarios, the assistant is expected to access specific knowledge (e.g., a database of restaurants, a calendar of appointments) that is not directly accessible to the user and must be consistently utilised to accomplish the task. In this paper, we conduct experiments to evaluate the trustworthiness of automatic assistants in task-oriented dialogues. Our findings indicate that state-of-the-art open-source LLMs still face significant challenges in maintaining logical consistency with a knowledge base of facts, highlighting the need for further advancements in this area.","Conversational assistants [1] are widely used to help human users achieve specific goals through dialogue. In a typical scenario (e.g., booking a restaurant, scheduling an appointment, selecting a song in a playlist, etc.), the assistant interprets the user’s goals, searches a database for relevant options, and provides the user with responses (e.g., a restaurant reservation, a new appointment in a calendar, a song playing on a smartphone). A key ability for an assistant is to maintain consistency between user requests and domain knowledge [2]. This is crucial because, in a typical setting, the user does not know the actual content of the database (e.g., all the restaurants in a city) and, as a consequence, cannot verify whether the assistant’s response is correct. While in traditional approaches [3], this consistency was ensured by a dedicated component responsible for retrieving information from a domain database, recent end-to-end approaches [4, 5] rely on a single LLM-based model for utterance understanding, domain knowledge retrieval, and response generation. In this setting, the LLM must generate responses that are as aligned with the database as possible. However, the ability of current end-to-end assistants to maintain consistency between the generated responses and the actual content of the domain knowledge is questionable (e.g., due to LLM confabulations), and there is a clear lack of empirical evidence on this crucial issue. To be more concrete, Figure 1 shows an example of an inconsistent dialogue with respect to the conversational knowledge base. Here, although there are two British restaurants in the knowledge base, the system (turn S1) informs the user that there are three British restaurants, providing incorrect information. This is an example of inconsistency generated by an LLM, which is the focus of this research. Our aim is to shed new light on the trustworthiness of an LLM playing the role of an assistant in a task-oriented conversational domain while interacting with a user. We aim to answer the following research questions: (i) How can we operationally define the consistency between a task-oriented dialogue and the domain database behind the dialogue? (ii) How can we quantify the degree of trustworthiness of an assistant-LLM? (iii) Can we collect empirical evidence on a sufficiently large amount of task-oriented dialogues? To address these research questions, we set up an experimental framework allowing large-scale analysis, where task-oriented dialogues are first automatically generated by two instances of a state-of-the-art LLM, LLama-3 8B [6], and then a more powerful LLM, GPT-4o [7], is used to detect potential inconsistencies between a dialogue and a corresponding domain knowledge base. We hope that new large-scale experimental data can be used to develop more reliable and effective task-oriented dialogue systems, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of conversational agents in various applications.","In this study, we explored the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating task-oriented dialogues, focusing on maintaining consistency with a provided KB and avoiding hallucinations. Our experiments demonstrated that Llama-3, despite its advancements, struggles to perform reliably in these settings. The model showed significant limitations, especially in dialogues that led to failed outcomes (where the desired restaurant was not in the KB) and longer interactions. As a side contribution, we release *The Dining Llamas of Oz*, a corpus of 1,311 dialogues generated through user Llama and system Llama interactions, to aid future research. Our findings highlight the need for further development to improve LLM reliability and accuracy in task-oriented dialogue applications.",3,Chatbots and Dialogue Systems

Crafted specifically for educational applications, this cutting-edge generator makes use of the comprehensive Italian-Clue-Instruct dataset, which comprises over 30,000 entries including diverse text, solutions, and types of clues. This carefully assembled dataset is designed to facilitate the creation of contextually relevant clues in various styles associated with specific texts and keywords. The study delves into four distinctive styles of crossword clues: those without format constraints, those formed as definite determiner phrases, copular sentences, and bare noun phrases. Each style introduces unique linguistic structures to diversify clue presentation. Given the lack of sophisticated educational tools tailored to the Italian language, this project seeks to enhance learning experiences and cognitive development through an engaging, interactive platform. By meshing state-of-the-art AI with contemporary educational strategies, our tool can dynamically generate crossword puzzles from Italian educational materials, thereby providing an enjoyable and interactive learning environment. This technological advancement not only redefines educational paradigms but also sets a new benchmark for interactive and cognitive language learning solutions.","While traditionally valued for their challenge and entertainment, crossword puzzles are increasingly recognized for their educational benefits. They provide an interactive learning environment that enhances the retention of both technical terms and general language skills, hence facilitating learning across various disciplines, improving language acquisition, and supporting cognitive development, through critical thinking and memory retention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 8, 9, 2, 10, 11]. The integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has further enhanced their effectiveness by providing sophisticated, contextually relevant clues for educational crosswords. This paper presents a novel tool that uses LLMs to generate tailored Italian educational crossword puzzles from texts, offering various clue types. By integrating user-provided texts or keywords and applying fine-tuning techniques, the tool produces high-quality clues and answers, offering educators a resource to develop more interactive and effective instructional methods.

The layout of this paper is organized in the following manner: Section 2 surveys the relevant literature in detail. Section 3 explains the methods used for dataset collection and curation. In Section 3, we describe the computational techniques employed in our study. Section 4 reports the results derived from our experimental analysis. Finally, Section 5 closes with conclusive insights and the broader implications of our research findings.","A novel system for generating crossword clues from Italian text is introduced, leveraging the newly developed Italian-Clue-Instruct dataset.

By fine-tuning two large language models (LLMs), Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 and Llama3-8b-Instruct, using this dataset, we have achieved significant improvements in the models’ ability to generate crossword clues from given text. The results highlight a substantial enhancement in model performance after fine-tuning. Both the Italian-Clue-Instruct dataset and the fine-tuned models are now publicly available, providing valuable tools for students and teachers to create educational crossword puzzles from Italian text. Future research will aim to develop models capable of generating various types of crossword clues, including fill-in-the-blank clues.",1,Language Models
